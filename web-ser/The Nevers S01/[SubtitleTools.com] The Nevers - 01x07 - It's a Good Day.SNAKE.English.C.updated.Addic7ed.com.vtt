WEBVTT

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.245
Pioneers have always
been met with ridicule.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.645
Pasteur. Lister.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.955
Those gentlemen were scientists.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.515
As am I.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.425
They tested observable phenomena.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.625
And let me see.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.055
Y-your thesis is that
"voices of the dead

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.695
can be heard through the new
London telephone network".

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.965
Do I have that right, Mr. Hague?

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.365
- Dr. Hague!
- But, may I ask

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.535
how many of these voices you yourself

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.380
have discerned through
the static interference?

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.605
No?

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.675
Mummy not rung lately?

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.515
We are not without
sympathy for your loss.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.085
My own dear mother
passed away just a year ago.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.425
- But, even so...
- We are to officially inform you

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.425
that as of this moment,

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.925
you are no longer a member

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.825
of Her Majesty's Royal Medical Society.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.000
Struck off.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.075
Wasn't that our telephone?

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.285
Hello?

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.900
I have been so patient.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.540
Won't you grant me a... a little grace?

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.140
Just a whisper.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.410
Just a song.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.915
We always loved our songs.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.425
Hello?

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.140
Mother.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.250
Put it out.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.355
Why does Amalia always
get the glamorous job?

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.630
Another silver tooth.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.795
Ooh!

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.030
Annie Carbey! We're not common thieves.

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.035
Are you sure it's even this place?

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.665
I...

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:50.035
It's only pauper's pit
on this side of the city.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.781
Where else are they going
to put someone like him?

00:06:51.785 --> 00:06:53.575
Dump him in the river!

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.145
I am done. Need some sleep.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.745
Sometimes, when I'm
digging these graves, I think

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.385
maybe I'll just slide
in underneath a box.

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:02.845
That's nice. Tell me more.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.130
Fuckin' finally.

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:14.565
Got him.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:19.495
... drilled straight
through the bloody floor.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.665
Sergeant told Briggsy Maladie sent them.

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:22.670
Told you.

00:07:22.675 --> 00:07:24.406
They was trying to pull
the fucking building down!

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:25.910
Brass. Look sharp.

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:55.835
Can you direct me
to the women's barracks?

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.535
Or am I a little early for those?

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:07.280
I just don't understand
why she did it...

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:29.695
There'll be an investigation,

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.200
so y-you can't take anything.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.675
This is them.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.275
The Touched.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.615
This is their revenge for Maladie.

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:46.045
- No.
- They won't stop

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:48.520
until they've shook London
into the ground.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.255
She's got no one now,

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.225
and you lot do nothing!

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:24.620
So, we know the last place
Maladie was seen.

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:28.685
At her own hanging.

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:30.505
We know how she was dressed.

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:32.095
As Miss Effie Boyle.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.125
Also deceased.

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:36.735
- According to your research.
- I'd take a wager,

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:38.635
the Colonel's still with her.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.735
We can offer a reward.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.240
S-someone must have
seen them on the streets.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:51.275
I've had Whitehall in my ear all morning

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.045
about our mismanagement of the hanging.

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:55.215
Remind me, who was the officer
in charge of that again?

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:56.685
I'll just call them up, should I?

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:58.486
Tell him you went and hung
the wrong bloody woman?

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:00.025
She wasn't even Touched?

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:01.990
- It's the truth.
- No one wants to hear it.

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:04.190
But, you can't...

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.025
No.

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:08.095
If you won't tell
the public about Maladie...

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.900
What are you gonna do,
go down Fleet Street?

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.635
You set one yellow toe in the direction

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.665
of those newspaper maggots, Mundi,

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:17.705
and I will personally make
sure that every last cop

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:19.305
of this side of Hadrian's fucking Wall

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:21.545
knows what kind of man you are.

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:24.945
The company you search out after dark.

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:26.815
All your gentlemen friends.

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:32.285
I like to do my research and all.

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:34.385
It's good to know
who you're working with.

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:37.290
But there'll be no more
special privileges on my watch.

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:40.195
You try and push through on this,

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.365
be five years hard labor
and public disgrace.

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:43.996
I don't think many people
would be interested

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.840
in your little story then, will they?

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:49.065
Not the best place for your sort.

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:50.275
Prison.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:53.975
So,

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.750
I'll just relieve you
of these, should I?

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:04.285
I'm taking you off the Touched detail.

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:05.885
Putting you out on the beat.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:11.890
World's gone mad.

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:29.305
- Mrs. True.
- Ms. Adair.

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:31.415
You did it.

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:34.615
We did it. How was the recon?

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.545
They've no idea what
we were doing there,

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:39.285
but they've tripled their
numbers since yesterday.

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:40.920
Grand Abbey's the same.

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:46.555
It wasn't your fault Maladie
didn't want to be saved.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.425
It was the graveyard,
you know? It just, uh...

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:51.165
It made me think of her soul,

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:53.395
wandering through the streets
of London for eternity.

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.405
And all those poor people,
just electrocuted.

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:58.235
They did come to watch her hang.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.676
- Harriet said some of them brought picnics.
- But you would have thought

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.646
that if anyone could have
spotted those power lines,

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:04.546
it should have been me.
She ran them through here.

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:06.680
Look. It's so obvious.

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:09.750
Stop going over it.

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:16.055
Is that how you dealt with it
when you were a soldier?

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:18.530
All the death, you just,
you stopped thinking about it?

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:23.230
I had a job to do.

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:28.935
Shall we make a start on our man?

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:31.775
You were going to have
that meeting first.

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:33.705
You know, the meeting
where you tell everyone

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:36.275
about the future and the Galanthi
and what's actually going on?

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.775
- There's no time.
- Amalia...

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:40.415
I've lived through this before,
remember?

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.085
Earthquakes are just the starting gun.

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:43.816
It's a matter of days
before the Galanthi emerges.

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:45.486
Well then, you've an hour
to spare now, haven't you?

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:47.755
We have to be down there
with it when it happens

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:51.425
in case it needs protection.
Or transport or...

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:53.655
I don't fucking know
what it'll need. A map?

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:56.465
- A ship?
- Well, whatever it needs, this lot can help.

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:59.035
- You owe them the truth.
- We can't do this by committee!

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.335
You know what it'll be like.
Herding bloody cats!

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:02.735
No one can agree on anything!

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:04.675
I'm sorry, it's just so much easier

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.236
to get on with things
when it's you and me.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.575
- Following your mission.
- Yes!

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:09.745
We have the body
of that thing right here.

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:11.450
It could be the answer
to who's down there.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.520
Come on, then. Let's make that start.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.190
Thank you.

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:35.265
Amalia's the spirit of
a soldier from the future

00:14:35.269 --> 00:14:37.036
in the body of a drowned baker,
and she's come here

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.676
to tell you all about
an alien under London

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.380
who gave you all your magical powers.

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:41.850
Hmm?

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:45.110
Got you off to a bit of a start.

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:55.485
Right.

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:57.525
... came out of that cave
with a clear mission

00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:00.665
to help the Galanthi
and be ready to defend it.

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:03.225
Well, thank you for your time.
Penance and I have some urgent...

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:04.600
Sorry, what did it tell you?

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:07.605
Galanthi don't really speak.

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:09.965
More like... show you
things in your mind.

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:12.175
Okay, so what things
did this one show you?

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:14.345
Just fragments. Nothing coherent.

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:16.575
But I thought it sang. Mary's song.

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:18.245
That's what Myrtle translated.

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:20.815
So, if I've got this
right, the Galanthi uses

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:23.145
its psychic tentacles
to suck out your brain.

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:24.916
Not that kind of alien.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.356
- Can you prove you're from the future?
- How would I do that?

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.425
You could... tell us what's
gonna happen tomorrow.

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:31.295
- Uh...
- Next week?

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:32.995
The Queen dies quite soon.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.095
But I haven't had my formal debut!

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:37.465
Forget it. Doesn't die.
I mean, does die.

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:39.695
- Everyone dies.
- But you didn't, apparently.

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:41.035
So what's the plan?

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.005
I mean, I know there
must be a plan, right?

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:45.006
Because the thing you just had us do...

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:48.475
Look, yesterday we went down
to the cave, some of us, anyway,

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.915
and it was a shit show.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:53.815
I only just escaped
those human-robot things.

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:56.315
- "Shock troops".
- Oh! Th-that is a good one.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.585
If we go back in blind,
we'll be slaughtered.

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:00.585
Or worse. There are Touched down there

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:02.755
more like the living dead than people.

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.595
Whoever's running
this operation hates us

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.465
as much as they do the Galanthi.
And as for the...

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:09.465
shock troops, yes,

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:11.135
that part of the plan
is already underway.

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:13.195
And no idea who these people could be?

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.105
Might even be someone from the future.

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:18.210
Hitched a ride like me.

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:20.905
Is that what the Galanthi showed you?

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:23.160
Like I said, not particularly coherent.

00:16:23.165 --> 00:16:25.315
Anyway, Penance will work on weapons.

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.875
No, not weapons.

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.945
Nonviolent objects
of confusion and defense.

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:31.515
And I will continue drawing
up our rescue strategy.

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.385
You do have resources here, you know.

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:36.695
What will the alien do when it come out?

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:38.695
What it was supposed to do
in the first place.

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:41.235
- Unite humanity.
- Oh. That sounds nice and easy.

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.065
Look, best-case scenario,

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:44.775
it's going to save the world.

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:46.305
Which world?

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.775
You said "save the world".

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:51.245
That's right.

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:53.550
Because I don't know about any future,

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:57.885
but the world outside this place...

00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:00.755
- is on fire.
- You said "best-case scenario". What's worst case?

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:02.555
It tears the world apart and we all die.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.595
George!

00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:51.605
Hey!

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:53.505
What's going on?

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:55.205
- I don't know.
- What happened?

00:17:55.209 --> 00:17:57.415
Was it, was it a rippling?

00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:00.015
PiTSiD. Flashbacks.

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:02.645
I thought they stopped when
you came here. Didn't...

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:04.385
Didn't everything go forward instead?

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:06.515
Clearly not.

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.725
Anyway, it wasn't the same as before.

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.065
Look, I'll sort myself out.

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:18.265
All on your own. Just like always, huh?

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:20.700
Amalia.

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:23.940
Stop. Stop.

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.935
Look at me.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:29.480
I've worked with soldiers
before. Look at me.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:36.385
Battle exhaustion doesn't
go away by ignoring it.

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:39.520
In my experience, and that's
exactly how it goes away.

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:42.055
I know what I need.

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:44.420
- No, you know what you want.
- Same thing as you.

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:49.730
You have no idea what I want.

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:55.635
Oh. Sorry to interrupt.

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:57.105
Look, I've done the fucking meeting.

00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:58.740
Now, can we please start?

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.730
Oh, fuck.

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:27.305
Uh, tidy up in there, will you?
The... things and the people.

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:31.670
No! Not that 16th century fucking Delft!

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:33.505
Jesus, Augie.

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:36.345
Hugo, this place is an absolute state.

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:39.045
Lucky that I'm here to help them do...

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:41.585
No, I-I prefer not to look
at it when it does that.

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:43.885
Thank you very much. Bloody river.

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:46.085
Well, someone's got to sort it out,

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:47.655
since I... since I very much doubt

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:49.625
you've actually removed
my name from those papers.

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:52.125
Don't worry your pretty
little head about all that.

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:53.555
Very much in the process.

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.565
Augie, Jesus. Is that a...

00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:58.065
- Is that a bleeding ear?
- And a fractured rib.

00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:59.965
Have you been...

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:01.500
fighting?

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:05.335
Who? What? When?

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:07.645
Tell me everything!

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:09.705
Actually, um, that is why I'm here.

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:11.880
I, um...

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:16.315
I do need to tell you something.
And I... I'm only...

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:19.455
I'm only telling you because...

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:22.420
really, you're my, you're
my best friend, and...

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.355
So...

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.600
Augie, have you met somebody?

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:29.425
Well, y-yes, actually.

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:31.365
I suppose, I suppose that is part of it.

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:33.395
- Who is it?
- I wouldn't want to say.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.965
Oh, a secret liaison. How delicious.

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:37.505
But you, uh, clearly need some advice,

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:38.805
so what went wrong?

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:43.405
- Well, um...
- Well, I know what I would say.

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:45.775
- Yes, please.
- Well, I would say...

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:49.745
"Lady-woman. I am Augustus Bidlow".

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.755
- Yes.
- "I am a man in my own right.

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.625
A man with a, with a, a bleeding ear

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:57.455
and a fractured rib. A fighting man".

00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:59.125
- Yes.
- "Independent, brave.

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:01.365
Choosing whichever path to
adventure I damn well want!"

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:04.335
Fuck.

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:06.195
Of course, you mustn't say any of that.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:07.965
Oh. Oh, yes. No.

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:11.875
No, Aug, you just be
your real, charming,

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.005
awkward self.

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:14.445
Who on Earth could resist it?

00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:17.480
Well, th-th-that's just it. Hugo...

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:22.615
Listen. My real self... I...

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:24.355
Oh f...

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.385
Will someone please do something

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:28.485
about these fucking tremors?!

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:31.226
There must be some sort
of minister or something.

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:33.754
Somehow, I struggle to see
the cream of London society...

00:21:33.759 --> 00:21:36.066
... trooping out to
the Saturnalia Ball...

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:38.696
... just to be dripped on next
to a fucking chamber pot!

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:40.705
A-a-a ball? No! No.

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:43.805
Hugo, I-I really... I really
don't think now's the time.

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:47.275
And actually, as the...
the official proprietor...

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:50.005
If yesterday's grotesque events
have taught me anything,

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:53.645
it is that London needs a fucking party!

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:55.315
So, if it's alright with you, Augie,

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:57.215
I intend to throw a festival
so extraordinary,

00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:59.955
so transcendent,
it will pass into legend.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:03.985
And all this ghastliness
will be obliterated. Erased!

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:05.395
Hugo...

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.325
You do realize that the Ferryman's

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:09.265
is just a sex club for rich people.

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:11.895
It is not just a sex club!

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:14.705
It is a fucking phenomenon!

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:57.105
Mrs. Beechum should've told you
this door is to remain closed.

00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:59.750
I'm sorry, my Lord,
I-I didn't intend to...

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:42.460
Apologies for the maid. First day.

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:49.060
Funny time to go shooting,
with all of London up in arms.

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:52.895
Nice bit of pheasant
you brought back, though.

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:57.675
Tell Roberts to take that
horse to the lower field.

00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:00.635
Ms. Lily's horse? Always
been a spirited creature.

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.505
I think it can sense the tremors.

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:04.615
If I was a superstitious woman,

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:06.380
I'd say they were a sign of something.

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:13.220
Messages from the heavens?

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:17.555
I'd have thought by now

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:21.230
you would have realized
that if there is a God,

00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:23.765
he's an Englishman.

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:27.340
He has no interest
in declaring his intentions.

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:36.410
You'll come back fighting.

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:40.575
You're the fuckin' Ape, mate.

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:42.915
Three-time champion of Limehouse.

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:46.185
Since when do you ever
throw in the towel, hm?

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:49.085
We've got a bit of fire!

00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:51.555
Oh, fucking opportunists.

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:53.495
Come on.

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:54.925
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:57.430
What did you see?

00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:00.365
Oi!

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:50.385
What are you scribbling away for?

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:52.355
"Nimble Jack's Tales of the Touched".

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:55.855
Newspaper men gonna be giving
their eye teeth for these.

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:58.525
The city's on fire, and
you're spinning stories.

00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:00.125
Someone should.

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:03.365
Only role model for a Touched
kid on the street is Maladie.

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:08.140
I'd rather they had a fire-wielding
Amazonian princess.

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:12.175
Is that where you think
my family's from?

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.805
Why would she kill herself,
though? Maladie.

00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:16.775
And all those people she took with her.

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:18.315
Was it 'cause, what,

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.745
they were hypocrites? Or...

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:23.315
Or why did you work for her?

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.215
Let's start with that.

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:27.155
Well...

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:29.125
there was the money.

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:31.255
- No.
- I don't know. She...

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:33.095
She just had something about her.

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:34.460
- But?
- End of the day,

00:26:34.465 --> 00:26:36.125
we're all just puppets
for her, you know?

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:39.295
Wind-up toys with a turn.

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:40.670
Not my kind of leader.

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:45.875
Is that what you came
here for, then? A leader?

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:47.940
Don't strike me as the following type.

00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:50.580
I'm just passing through.

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.490
Never like to stay anywhere for long.

00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:10.965
Who could do this, that's
what I want to know.

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:14.035
Look at him. It's time that's
been taken, the design.

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:17.305
I just hope the artist left
some kind of signature.

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:18.976
Could be the first step
towards whoever's got

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:20.305
the Galanthi under armed guard.

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:21.575
Jimmy here can get some justice

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:23.005
for what was done to him.

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:24.245
Jimmy?

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:27.115
Uh... After my Uncle Jim.

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.780
- What happened to him?
- No, nothing.

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.385
Just miss him, so...

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:38.525
How did they replace
his nervous system like that?

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:40.595
Could it be electrical then?

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.096
Or how would they store up enough charge

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:43.895
to make them last so long?

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:46.335
Nice to see you enjoying your work.

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:47.670
Oh, no, no.

00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:51.605
It is horrible. I just...

00:27:51.610 --> 00:27:53.475
I've never seen this
kind of science before.

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:56.350
This isn't science. This is evil.

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:16.470
What's that?

00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:24.165
- What was that connected to?
- Nothing.

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:26.735
Not the nerves, not the wiring.

00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:29.580
It looks like some sort of a casing.

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:33.550
What's that there?

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:35.520
It's a stamp.

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:37.450
Huh.

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:39.550
These are letters.

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:42.285
Chinese.

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:45.195
Tam. Pennyfield clockmaker.

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.825
You need to come with us.

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:48.765
Lot of trouble in Limehouse these days.

00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:50.665
We're all ready for trouble,
Mrs. True and I.

00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:54.170
Please, Su Ping, I only speak a few
words of Chinese. And badly.

00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:56.665
I know.

00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:01.075
Myrtle, no.

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:03.905
It's too restless in the city
today. No one's to go out.

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:05.275
No children are allowed to go.

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:07.780
Back you go.

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:26.295
Incoming!

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:37.410
Amalia?

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:42.220
Oh, no. We'll be walking targets
out there wearing those.

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:44.985
Um...

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:46.555
Uh, Mrs. True and I are...

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.525
we're on a bit of a mission, so...

00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:49.790
I-I'm game.

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:56.795
Um, a-about that,

00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:59.495
with the, uh, the cave a-and...

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:01.970
I wanted to apologize, I suppose.

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:06.810
And also... also n-not
apologize, actually.

00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:10.845
'Cause I'm a... I'm my own man.

00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:12.815
I'm... I'm a fighter.

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:14.380
And I'm a, um...

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:19.585
I just... I'm gonna
pollom... follup... pollum...

00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:21.860
I'm gonna follow my own path,
whatever way that takes me.

00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:27.830
Amalia! W... Just wait.

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:30.665
That was a disaster.

00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:32.130
Embarrassing.

00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:51.685
Tell you what, though.
All this focus on the Galanthi.

00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:55.185
There's no one out there anymore
doing what Mrs. True and Lucy used to.

00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:57.455
Looking out for the likes of us.

00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:58.895
Lord knows there's more.

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:01.025
Don't envy them today.

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:34.285
Strange place to meet.

00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:36.285
Me and me brother used to come down here

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:38.855
when we was scuppers.

00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:41.700
Dig around. You find all sorts.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.425
I never knew you had a family.

00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:45.635
What, did you think

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:47.895
I just washed up here one day.

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:50.265
Perhaps, they...

00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:52.735
they grew me at a workhouse.

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:54.880
To what do I owe the summoning, Frank?

00:32:56.110 --> 00:32:57.975
That woman.

00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:00.320
Effie Boyle, that journalist, remember?

00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:03.415
You was in the station.

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:04.785
She was there.

00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:07.660
You was laughing together, whispering.

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:11.455
Were you jealous?

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:13.355
Did you know her?
Had you met her before?

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:14.825
- No.
- What did she say to you?

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:16.895
What did she say? Let me see.

00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:20.595
She said that she thought
you were wasted in your job.

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:22.565
- She never said that.
- She said that

00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:25.005
the longer you spend on that
rotten police force of yours,

00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:26.376
the further you are
from ever being the man

00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:27.980
- you're meant to be in.
- Hm.

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:31.310
What kind of man is that then?

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:39.955
You know, the thing about you, Swann...

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:42.460
- I sense that you're going to tell me.
- Yeah.

00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:45.895
The thing about you

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:47.625
is you got it all.

00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:51.095
The blue bloods, the money, the parties,

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:52.595
and you wear it well.

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:54.900
But I think, underneath...

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:57.270
you despise it.

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:01.510
I don't think you want none of it.

00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:04.975
And I suppose...

00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:07.545
you're going to tell me
what it is that I want?

00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:08.950
No.

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:12.290
Now that, I cannot claim to know.

00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:17.430
Hold up.

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.600
Here we go!

00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:23.300
Eh?

00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:25.795
Look at that.

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:29.800
Will that get me into
your posh little club, will it?

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:33.080
Get me some of that charm?

00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:36.340
Hm?

00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:40.780
What did she say to you?

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:48.920
She told me to keep an eye on you.

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:52.730
Whether you like it or not.

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:04.105
Everybody needs a friend, Frank!

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:45.210
Ah! Ah!

00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:18.375
Ordinarily,

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:20.775
a guest waits for an invitation
before paying a visit.

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:23.585
Well, perhaps you should
tell that to Mrs. Amalia True.

00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:25.055
After all, I didn't invite her

00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:26.885
to our little excavation site, did you?

00:36:26.890 --> 00:36:30.120
- And yet, down she came all the same.
- Mrs. True?

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:34.655
- What was she doing there?
- Talking to the creature, apparently.

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:37.595
Decapitating a few of my guards.

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:41.235
But mainly communicating.
I think she upset it.

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:42.935
All these earthquakes.

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:46.475
You think the monster is
responsible for the tremors?

00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:50.945
Is there any way that she could
have discovered my involvement?

00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:52.345
Anything in the cave? Think!

00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:53.676
You know, it's been raised before,

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:55.785
but I question Mrs. True's credentials.

00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:57.815
She doesn't seem like a baker to me.

00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:01.115
And I'm beginning to wonder
if your two little projects

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:05.355
may no longer be quite, uh, compatible.

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:08.055
Rehabilitation has always been designed

00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:09.765
to go hand-in-hand with a cure.

00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:12.595
But what if society were to find out

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:14.895
about our side line?

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:17.610
Our little cerebral...

00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:20.975
forays?

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:24.750
Medical breakthroughs have
always required human trials.

00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:29.045
I will take care of Amalia True.

00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:31.585
And when the creature
is dead, she and her kind

00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:34.585
will all be released from
their purgatorial affliction.

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:37.255
Well, truthfully, if it's
even taken form in there,

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:39.780
we don't know quite what effect
killing the creature might have.

00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:43.900
Our doubts are traitors, are they not?

00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:47.940
But...

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:50.610
with you beside me,

00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:53.535
Lavinia,

00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:56.175
I find I am...

00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:58.310
resolve itself.

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:09.860
- Much further to the clockmaker?
- Not far.

00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:18.265
I didn't mean all that.
The cave, you know?

00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:20.695
You are allowed to make
your own choices.

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:23.235
I just thought if I could
find the Galanthi,

00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:25.675
then it might... it might...

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:26.680
show me...

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:30.075
tell me...

00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:32.875
Turns out, the thought of
wearing one of these things,

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:35.715
it's a lot more frightening
than going off to face

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:37.590
the might of Her Majesty's armed forces.

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:43.985
W-would you... Would you do the honors?

00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:45.395
You know it's not the best day

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:46.760
to be wearing one of those things.

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:48.965
Doesn't matter.

00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:09.285
What's wrong?

00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:11.490
S-Sorry. It's, um...

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:14.560
uh, the-the-the birds today.

00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:17.785
They keep losing their direction.

00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:19.825
Because of the tremors?

00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:22.625
Doesn't the book tell us the witchcraft

00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:25.895
and powers, all these
are an affront to God!

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:28.365
And has He ever shown London

00:39:28.370 --> 00:39:31.265
such signs of His displeasure?

00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:34.005
Cracking the very earth
on which we stand!

00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:36.110
See? Trouble.

00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:40.515
- We shouldn't stay.
- Filling the streets

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:42.545
with fire and blood!

00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:46.255
- And what about you, brothers and sisters?
- Thank you very much.

00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:48.586
- Will you not answer His call?
- We will!

00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:51.056
- Will you not waken to His alarms?
- Yeah, we will!

00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:52.725
Will you not rise, London?

00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:55.125
Look!

00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:56.365
There's one!

00:39:56.370 --> 00:39:57.865
- Yeah!
- Hey! There he is!

00:39:57.870 --> 00:39:59.195
A fucking witch!

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:07.840
We're going to go.
This way. We're going...

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:15.545
You've got a reckoning coming!

00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:24.055
This is the piece we found.

00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:29.225
- Hm...
- You recognize it?

00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:32.995
It is a casing from one
of our carriage clocks.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.740
That is a number in the mark.

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:41.375
We will find the buyer for you.

00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:56.160
Too much trouble with these men.

00:40:57.330 --> 00:40:59.055
They say the city belongs to them.

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:07.265
None of the Touched can stay
in Chinatown anymore.

00:41:07.770 --> 00:41:10.166
Someone is giving
the Purists our names...

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:13.105
... and addresses.

00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:51.175
Amalia?

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:55.450
She's found the address.

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:09.165
She's Touched!

00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:13.600
- Catch the witch!
- Come on!

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:35.655
Is she Italian? What's she saying?

00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:38.230
She's not Italian. She's Touched.

00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:40.630
Speak again.

00:42:42.370 --> 00:42:43.600
Go on.

00:42:44.770 --> 00:42:46.570
I said speak!

00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:48.970
Freak.

00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:17.965
Oi!

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:21.695
Bessie!

00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:33.915
My friend said it's 'cause
you're cursed by God.

00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:35.445
The Touched.

00:43:35.450 --> 00:43:37.585
But I know. I've seen.

00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:39.615
It's you that is the curse on us!

00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:42.725
And you take and you take,
and you turn everything bad!

00:44:20.430 --> 00:44:22.495
Come on.

00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:25.095
Come on, girl. Come on.

00:45:37.610 --> 00:45:38.940
Myrtle...

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:44.505
Myrtle! Go on! Run!

00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:47.580
You hearing me? Run!

00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:42.225
- What are you doing here?
- It's you, you bullocks!

00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:43.625
You fucking blinded me.

00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:45.165
You kicked me in the unmentionables!

00:47:45.170 --> 00:47:47.065
A vagina is not unmentionable, Penance!

00:47:47.070 --> 00:47:49.205
We've been through this before!

00:47:49.210 --> 00:47:50.940
- Fuck.
- Mm...

00:47:51.610 --> 00:47:52.675
Oh...

00:47:54.410 --> 00:47:56.375
Mrs. True.

00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:58.145
Ms. Adair.

00:47:58.150 --> 00:48:00.250
How did you get here
without the address?

00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:03.350
Does it matter?

00:49:10.250 --> 00:49:11.450
Hm.

00:49:53.930 --> 00:49:55.900
Jimmy.

00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:10.580
Dr. Hague.

00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:37.165
Darling.

00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:42.545
- Who is this?
- Who is this?

00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:56.725
You're calling to speak to...

00:50:56.730 --> 00:50:59.495
That accent's liable to slip.

00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:02.825
Am I wrong in saying... Canadian?

00:51:02.830 --> 00:51:04.925
Originally.

00:51:04.930 --> 00:51:08.035
Ah. Then, let me ask...

00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:12.070
Did you ever stop believing
this was all a sim?

00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:17.405
- You're the Stripe.
- Who the fuck are you?

00:51:17.410 --> 00:51:20.545
My dear, did you think
you were the only one

00:51:20.550 --> 00:51:22.375
who hitched a ride?

00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:24.120
Hello?

00:51:37.570 --> 00:51:38.900
Amalia!

00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:01.415
Ah...

00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:05.030
Ah!

00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:15.270
Ah!

00:52:21.110 --> 00:52:22.210
Aaah!

00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:21.965
Ah!

00:53:50.530 --> 00:53:51.930
Amalia!

00:53:53.770 --> 00:53:54.865
Amalia!

00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:59.035
Amalia!

00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:09.315
Amalia?

00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:20.225
Give ear, O Lord, unto my prayer.

00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:22.765
In the day of my trouble, I will
call upon You for Thou wilt...

00:54:22.770 --> 00:54:23.960
No.

00:54:25.770 --> 00:54:28.600
No, not the praying, please.

00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:52.260
See? They're going to stop.

00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:02.440
I'm losing my fucking mind.

00:55:05.970 --> 00:55:09.380
I'm breaking up into little pieces.

00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:19.455
What if the Galanthi comes out
and I just disappear?

00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:27.560
Zephyr Alexis Navine, you listen to me.

00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:32.025
Right now, we have a name to our enemy.

00:55:32.030 --> 00:55:34.435
We have a strange old lady
from the future on the other end

00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:37.135
of a telephone line. We have
an alien under threat.

00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:39.035
We have a mission to save
the bleeding world,

00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:41.905
so I will not hear one more word
from you about disappearing

00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:44.750
or breaking up or giving up.
Do you understand me, soldier?

00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:49.550
Get on your fucking feet
and get back to work.

00:57:04.590 --> 00:57:06.560
Oh, hello.

00:57:17.970 --> 00:57:20.605
No use struggling.

00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:36.420
Toodle-oo.

00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:17.600
Bess.

00:58:21.870 --> 00:58:22.940
No.

00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:26.410
What they done...

00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:35.345
We can't let it stand.
