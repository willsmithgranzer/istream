00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.096
We've heard nothing from
Dr. Hague since yesterday.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.895
Dr. Hague is missing.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.635
His house has been burned.
We are under siege.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.600
- Madam?
- He may be dead for all we know.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.770
The creature must be destroyed.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.175
Before they can free it.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.705
But we've tried everything.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.205
The shell cannot be broken.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.190
Leave me.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.550
Ah, ah!

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.325
Fuck. Isaiah.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.600
I'm scared. They're shouting outside.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.070
It's okay. We're safe here. Come on.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.715
If you didn't stay up drawing monsters,

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.175
you wouldn't have nightmares.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.150
- They're not nightmares.
- Hm. Come on.

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.015
It's alright.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.260
It's alright. Don't worry.
They'll move on.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.325
Move, move, move. Let's go.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.515
Whoa!

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.745
Whoa, it's just us! Annie!

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:02.750
It's me!

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.415
It's me.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.055
Well, get in, will you?

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.725
Go, go.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.185
As it happens...

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.185
we're due to meet the Pope.

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.315
I've never been to the Vatican.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.260
- Is it far?
- It's a great mystery.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.925
I lost her scent. Don't get pissy.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.995
Thought it was a hum.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.995
Oh, ye of little faith.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.445
- Come on.
- Nice costume, lovie!

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.185
Ladies...

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.355
Woo!

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:50.760
Oh!

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.065
- Can I help you?
- Your Eminence.

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:57.495
Beg pardon, sir.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.896
As it happens, we'll be
taking run of the place.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.305
Fix us a pie or two, would you?
Been half-starved.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:03.465
No cheeses in mine.

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.205
You heard her. No dairy.

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.645
Do us all a favor. Hop to!

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.695
Any issues?

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.935
Just a few rowdies redecorating.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.435
No one's come looking for more.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.335
You should get some sleep.

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:41.240
You know, there are people
here who need you, too.

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:43.745
Myrtle.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:45.215
She stopped speaking.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:46.475
Had she started?

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.755
She's home. She's safe.
She's fine. What else can I do?

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.485
Sort out your priorities.

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.020
You can't just take off all night
in the middle of a riot.

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.100
Horatio's here.

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.665
- Is he?
- Stashed him in your office.

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:06.330
Figured you wouldn't mind.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.770
Thanks.

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.200
Sorry. S...

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:36.125
Katherine is in the dorms,

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:38.570
- and wasn't sure that was approp...
- Katherine?

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.240
Our house was attacked, Amalia.

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:45.905
The Purists.

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.245
- Annie said that this would be okay, so...
- Right. yes.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:50.510
Um, of course.

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:55.686
Well, Penance and I made
a bit of a discovery...

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:58.255
You know what, he just fell
asleep, so is it alright if we...

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.785
- Right. Y... No.
- 'Cause it's been a long night.

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:02.920
Yes, yes. Yes.

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:52.435
Why don't you bring it to her yourself?

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.975
- Not today.
- Not any day.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:57.775
I have business.
I'll be back this evening.

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.245
Can't business wait?
She needs to see you.

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:01.815
She thinks you don't care about her.

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:03.645
So, relieve her of that notion.

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:05.455
You can't leave her down there forever.

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.520
She's your daughter.

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:13.325
My daughter is dead.

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:17.025
And I will not allow this house
to fade into obscurity

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:20.635
because I wasn't strong enough
to bear its burdens.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.165
Business cannot wait.

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:35.715
Someone's got to talk
to her about what happened.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.385
Can't just leave her alone in there.

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:45.330
I saved you a fruit bun.

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:59.275
Mine had a big blackberry in it.

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.480
Never seen a blackberry that big before.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.905
- Dr. Hague? Hm...
- Do you remember him?

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:31.205
Not an easy creature to forget.

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:33.975
He wasn't far off from most
of the lunatics in that place.

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:35.675
That much I've gathered.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.605
Though his file was frustratingly thin.

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:39.615
- File?
- And his "special study"

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:42.345
with Sarah was predictably sanitized.

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:44.385
But I was hoping for some insights.

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:47.420
The man and I didn't
exactly take tea together.

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:52.425
He had a mother.

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:55.895
- Used to talk about her all the time.
- We all have mothers.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.170
Mm. Not like this.

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:01.565
Is this about the case?

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:03.705
It's a mission. I'm not Agatha Christie.

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:05.775
- Who?
- What?

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:09.405
The case. The watch case from yesterday.

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:12.015
Ah, yes. Led me to the doctor's house.

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:13.916
I think he might be the one
guarding the Galanthi.

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.886
- What were you doing at his house?
- Christmas dinner.

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:17.285
Amalia, why are you being evasive?

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:19.185
I'm not being evasive.
I'm being defensive.

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:20.815
It wasn't exactly my tidiest work.

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.555
Yes, I can see that.

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.725
Still, not entirely without reward.
Now, I have a name.

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:27.760
Yes, but you could have had an episode.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.795
You worried about me?

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:45.815
No, no, no, no, don't, don't.

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:47.380
I'll lock the door.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.985
Don't do that either.

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:56.785
Why is it every man turns into a saint

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:58.495
when he smells his wife's perfume?

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.530
I'm not a saint, but I'm also
not a fucking madman.

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:13.075
You really think he built those things?

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.675
I think we're calling them
Shock Troops now.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:17.075
Because if he did,

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.915
he didn't build them by himself.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.685
I mean, the man was
a proficient lobotomist,

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:23.785
but his gifts ended there.

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:25.555
Perhaps Mother knows best then.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.915
I'm just saying be careful, Amalia.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.785
The fate of humanity
is a dangerous business.

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:33.855
But it doesn't have to be your business.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:36.870
Wow. Isn't that a thought?

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:53.515

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.285

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:57.985
Huh?

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.655
Know what X marks?

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.695
Please. Sarah.

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:09.130
No. Not from you.

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:12.165
That's your name, isn't it?

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:14.135
I haven't been Sarah
for a stretch, darling,

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:15.667
or didn't that make it
down your hidey-hole?

00:13:15.671 --> 00:13:17.471
I know what they call you.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.310
That's not who you are.

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:23.467
You're a sweet girl.

00:13:23.472 --> 00:13:25.415
You're not a disease.

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:27.815
Reckon it wears just fine. On your feet.

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:29.745
Let's get you in the ground.

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:31.515
Do you know why

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.215
I took you away from the asylum?

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:35.225
Boring. I'm bored now.

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:38.495
It's not why you think.

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.025
Why I think.

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:43.265
Therefore, I am. If not, I'm not.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.095
- And I am.
- I...

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:50.710
had...

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.475
no choice.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.650
Was it I who solicited you
from the darkness then?

00:13:55.655 --> 00:13:58.315
Oh, yes.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.715
You're angry. Well, you should be.

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:07.615
But you have to understand, Sarah,

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:09.325
how special... No, how important

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:10.725
you are to us... Me.

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:12.995
- Us, is it?
- No. No, my...

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.725
My fellow... researchers.

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:17.395
Oh, we mustn't forget Mother!

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:20.965

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:24.770

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:29.045
But I've been down in
the cold earth, Doctor.

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:30.605
Down in the rot.

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:33.745
I've swung from the gallows
till my blood congealed.

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:36.220
All of it was as nothing.

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:40.385
Nothing to your...

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:42.320
shiny, little...

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:44.830
knife.

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:50.865
There's nothing about those
days I don't remember.

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:52.065
Shh, no, no, no.

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.905
No, I understand. I understand

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:57.665
how hard this must have been for you.

00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:58.975
You're about to.

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:00.975
But our work together was vital.

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:03.605
It was pivotal, and this...

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:07.145
isn't about anything. It's... petty.

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:09.650
As me or you.

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:14.960
This is God's will. Sarah...

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.995
Come on. Not much gristle on you.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.265
Best get started or
we'll be here all night.

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:45.820
Whoa! Whoa, there.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:48.820
Guards! Fall in!

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:10.610
Oh, my.

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:19.555
Seems I've been attacked.

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.185
I thought I'd help you tidy up...

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:23.625
A little-known fact
about cables and cords.

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:25.825
They prefer their tanglings.

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:27.455
Ah.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:30.025
That explains the hostility.

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:31.765
Well, that's very sweet
of you to come by

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:33.895
and check up on me in the first place.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.135
You know, you didn't have to do that.

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:38.110
Well...

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:41.005
Of course.

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:42.740
Sometimes, a gentleman likes to...

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:44.505
No, no! Oh!

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:46.145
Sorry. Sorry.

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:48.545
This is not very gentlemanly
behavior, Mr. Bidlow.

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:52.585
Um... It's... No.

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:54.890
I-I wasn't... I'm not... Sorry.

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:58.230
You haven't even tried to kiss me yet.

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:02.795
Well, I-I assure you, Ms. Adair,
I'm not trying to do anything.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.895
- You're not?
- No. No...

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:05.900
Why?

00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:09.665
- W-why?
- Why aren't you trying to kiss me?

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:12.575
Well, I...

00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:14.375
I suppose, I-I am... I am...

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:16.175
I am trying to kiss you then.

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:17.845
- Just generally.
- Generally?

00:17:17.850 --> 00:17:20.775
Yes, in a general manner...

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:23.250
- But not now?
- No! No. No.

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:29.260
W-would you like me to try
and kiss you then?

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:32.925
Generally.

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:34.795
- Oh.
- But not now, of course.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.565
- Right.
- Because your sister's here.

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:38.326
- What?
- And she's brought half an army with her.

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:40.235
- Oh God...
- I suppose you better leg it

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.235
before she finds you.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.965
What on earth is she up to now?

00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:46.775
- And so Myrtle defended herself.
- It's curious.

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:48.205
The papers left that out.

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:49.875
I don't control public opinion.

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:51.375
What do you control?

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.520
I take full responsibility
for the incident, but...

00:17:54.524 --> 00:17:55.615
As I understand it,

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:57.745
Ms. Best has taken full responsibility.

00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:58.885
Not much left for you.

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:01.415
As I said, no one asked Lucy to do that.

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:04.255
And yet her incarceration
is a greater sacrifice

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:05.625
for this institution than you,

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:07.725
its supposed caretaker, has ever made.

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:10.265
If Lucy's in jail,
it's because she chooses to be.

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:12.530
The woman could split
the sun open, for God's sake.

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:17.635
Well, I have no interest in
parsing whatever grievance

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.135
has arisen between the two of you.

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.975
But if it's orders you're looking for,

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:22.810
consider yourself obliged.

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:33.115
This orphanage is a sanctuary.

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:36.185
Many of the girls here
have nowhere else to go

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:38.595
and would end up on the streets
were it not for my charity.

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:39.855
And we thank you for that.

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.095
It's a charity that
is difficult to justify

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:44.125
with every single one
of these incidents.

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:46.635
Now, I am not a bottomless well.

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.635
I rely on the benefaction of my
compeers to keep the doors open,

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.565
and as their outrage swells,

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:54.705
- the purse strings tighten.
- A child was attacked.

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:56.275
Perhaps your compeers would care

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.075
to direct their outrage elsewhere.

00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.875
I'm sorry. Is it fairness
you're looking for?

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.985
- I'm not a nanny.
- I don't know what you are.

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:03.885
And neither does the public.

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:06.085
Rest assured, they will be
happy to fill in the gap,

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:07.685
and now that Maladie is in the ground,

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:11.225
the face of this poor, young,
dead girl will do just fine.

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:15.565
My guards will be stationed
outside for your protection.

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:17.465
No one will come in

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:19.795
or out, including you,

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.865
until this unrest is settled.

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:24.405
Or I will be forced to withdraw
my patronage fully

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:25.835
and permanently.

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.175
How quickly a sanctuary
becomes a prison.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.515
Starting to wish you'd left me
to rot in that asylum.

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:44.755
It's always an option
we can revisit if you prefer.

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.230
Can't say I miss that
particular fraternity.

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:51.465
Although perhaps my old keepers

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:53.595
have remained nearer than I presumed.

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.105
That is a scenario of your own making.

00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:57.140
Is it?

00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:00.875
The hospital informed me
that a thief made off

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.305
with some choice records
this very morning.

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:08.075
Preoccupied with a Dr. Hague,
it seems. Do you know the man?

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:10.550
- Can't say I'm familiar.
- Neither can I.

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:15.095
But the administration
insists that the perpetrator

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:18.070
bore a striking resemblance
to a former patient.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.265
I assured them otherwise.

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:26.205
You're not as special as you
fathom yourself, Mrs. True.

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:29.205
And if you care at all for
the welfare of these girls,

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:32.445
you will swallow that
sizable pride of yours

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:37.415
and be the person we are
all waiting for you to become.

00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:38.690
Good morning.

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.820
Door!

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:02.605
Amalia?

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:05.165
I wanted to thank you.

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:07.705
Horatio and I are very
grateful for the hospitality.

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:08.710
Of course.

00:22:08.715 --> 00:22:11.715
I'd like to help with some
meals while we're here.

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.215
Perhaps the children's schooling?

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:14.875
We'll make up for the imposition.

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.615
Not necessary. You're guests.

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:19.055
That's very kind,
but if it's all the same,

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:20.785
I'd prefer not to live on charity.

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:22.820
You get used to it.

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:28.695
I suppose it must be nice for
you to have Horatio around.

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.835
You're gonna be
a beautiful bride, Molly.

00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:41.205
Now, leave me.

00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:44.045
Everything feels so dangerous.

00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:46.845
With all the riots
in the city and the tremors.

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:48.775
Good to have a doctor close by.

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:52.150
He's not so hard on the eyes either.

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.625
Sorry. That was, um...

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:57.285
Another joke?

00:22:57.290 --> 00:22:58.995
Generously put.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.755
I happen to agree.

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.395
And I don't know what my husband
has told you about me,

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:06.465
but I have a much keener
sense of humor than he does.

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:08.565
A low bar to clear.

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:12.110
Yes, well, um...
I should get back to it.

00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:01.255
Careful with it. Butcher's kiddos.

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.320
Cold as they come.

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:10.095
Officer.

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:14.440
Here to gawk, then?

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:17.565
I'm here to say thank you, Lucy.

00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:19.135
Yeah?

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:21.175
What've I got to be thanked for?

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:23.175
Young Ms. Haplisch would
never have made it home

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:24.605
if it weren't for you.

00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:26.215
That is the truth.

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:27.780
The truth is...

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:30.890
I belong here.

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:34.355
Maybe not for what got me.

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:35.860
One way or the other,

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:39.290
we all end up where we belong.

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:42.360
I have something for you.

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:45.325
A gift.

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:48.395
What to get the woman who's got it all?

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:52.170
What about a cure?

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.740
Are all you minted bastards
just the same?

00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:00.075
Money's got your problems set,

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.845
so you go hunting for new ones.

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:05.350
What if I told you
I could end your disease?

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:08.955
Make you whole again.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:11.795
I'd say I've already trekked
that road to nowhere.

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:14.860
Thank you, but no.

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:29.075
This is the end of that road.

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:43.285
You alright there?

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:44.925
Hm. What?

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:47.395
Just a shade paler than usual.

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:49.425
You still getting those new ripplings?

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:52.025
Were these walls always
so close together?

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:53.565
I'll look into it.

00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:55.465
Find anything useful in Hague's files?

00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:56.700
Another dead end.

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:05.180
All these poor people.

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:08.215
Mm-hmm.

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:10.350
I wonder what he really
wanted with them.

00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:19.025
Can't stay here.

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:20.225
You can't sneak out.

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:21.826
There's guards all
at the back gates now.

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:23.665
Can't risk getting seen.

00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:25.895
I have to say, it's very
kind of Lavinia Bidlow

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:27.465
to keep us all so safe and cozy.

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:29.635
The timing's certainly convenient.

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:32.805
And I got the sense she wasn't
unfamiliar with our dear doctor.

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:34.835
I have been thinking about our...

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:37.245
"telephone hitchhiker".

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:39.175
She could be one
of the portal engineers.

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:40.775
- They were dead.
- So were you.

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:42.186
Well, considering who she's calling,

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:43.985
I'd say more likely Freelife than PDC.

00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:45.885
So, what does that make Hague?

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:49.685
A man running out of time. What's this?

00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:52.695
Oh, just hammering out
a little something.

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:55.825
An electromechanical automated
telephone exchange rerouter.

00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:57.325
I'm calling it the Collecticom.

00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:59.335
- So, a switchboard.
- No! No!

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:01.895
Do you think that Thomas Edison
has people question

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:03.835
all the names of his inventions?

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:06.005
And you did this all in one night?

00:27:06.010 --> 00:27:07.275
Lots of hours in the day

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:08.776
when you don't use any for sleep.

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:10.205
And this is meant to help us

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:12.145
track down Hague's mystery caller?

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:14.945
As soon as I tap into the
National Telephone Company line,

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:16.346
get this little beauty eavesdropping

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:18.045
for electronic telephone signatures

00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:19.815
coming into Mr. Hague's address.

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:21.355
- Doctor.
- Hm?

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:23.725
- He's a doctor. I'm just saying.
- Pardon me.

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:26.425
Let's not disrespect the man
keeping brains in a vat.

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:28.895
- You sure you're alright?
- I'm fine.

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:31.665
I simply need to plot an escape
without unhousing us all,

00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:34.795
infiltrate a fortified military
complex, and rescue

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.335
an alien demigod from the clutches

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:38.605
of a Touched-maimed lunatic
before the city plunges

00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:40.375
- into seismic doom.
- So,

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:42.605
I should probably get
this all wired in then.

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:44.075
Right now would be good, yeah.

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:03.565
Dogs barking, are they?

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:04.770
What am I doing?

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:08.435
Is this my grave?

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:17.275
If you're gonna kill me...

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:19.945
Fucker!

00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:22.415
- He distracted me!
- Ah.

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:25.215
Defecation calls.

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:26.355
Your deal.

00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:32.595
You look small down there.

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:37.895
- Sarah...
- I said don't call me that.

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:39.395
Maladie, please.

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:41.535
Lost your patience, have you?

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:45.065
As I remember, you took
your time with me,

00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:48.310
even when I begged for death.

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:51.075
You had other ideas.

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:54.415
Where's a man get ideas like that?!

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:58.445
I spent two years with you,
and here I am!

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:00.615
You've spent two minutes
with me, and there you are,

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:02.385
quivering like a maid
on her wedding night!

00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:04.185
Where's your grit, huh?

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:06.660
Where's your mettle?

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:12.500
Know where I found mine?

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:16.165
I did a murder.

00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:19.670
My very first. You never
forget your first.

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:23.505
Poor girl. Had to be done though.

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:25.975
Such a torment, chained to that rock.

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:27.945
Every day opened, and every day,

00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:30.945
dissected and devoured and divided

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:34.755
until she was nothing but meat.

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:36.685
I considered it a service in the end.

00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:39.860
I'm sure she'd appreciate it
if I helped you in kind.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:51.605
Go ahead! Beg me!

00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:54.735
- And the only way out is down.
- Please, please, please...

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:56.645
- Cold earth, eh?
- I-I won't...

00:29:56.650 --> 00:29:59.045
- Yeah, the cold rot. Rot.
- No, no, no, please, please...

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:02.045
- I won't...
- No, the other beg! Beg me for death.

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:04.815
Like Sarah begged you.

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:06.885
Like she begged me!

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:09.725
Beg and see if we can find
you some of that mercy!

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:32.050
It's okay.

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.320
I understand.

00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:39.615
Eh, you were playing the part.

00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:43.660
We all got a part.

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:23.100
Can I take a look?

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:34.505
I thought you loved those stories.

00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:40.550
Not like how they make it seem, huh?

00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:45.390
All that adventure and excitement.

00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:50.090
The real thing is much more cruel.

00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:58.965
When I was a boy,

00:31:58.970 --> 00:32:02.465
we couldn't afford storybooks, so...

00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:04.205
I used to

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:06.910
swipe penny mags from the navy barracks.

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:10.675
My brother thought I was mad,

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:13.680
risking a beating or worse
if they caught me, but...

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:16.915
I figured it was a good deal.

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:20.485
You see, I got to live 100 lives
thanks to those stories.

00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:23.320
Even... even if they were all made up.

00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:28.930
They let me wonder
what else was out there.

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:36.140
You did something very brave, Myrtle.

00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:39.170
And I'm sorry you're suffering.

00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:42.680
I wish I could heal that, too.

00:32:44.410 --> 00:32:46.145
But you stood up.

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:49.685
You stood up and you tried
to save a life because...

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:53.020
because it was the right thing to do.

00:33:24.850 --> 00:33:26.920
All hands on deck, is it?

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:34.925
Have I got your word

00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:36.965
you won't bring the walls down?

00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:41.400
The way things are headed, probably
comin' down just the same.

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:49.005
Brave move.

00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:51.705
Taking the word of a violent criminal.

00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:54.275
I grew up around violent criminals.

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:57.145
You ain't the type.

00:33:57.150 --> 00:34:00.315
Well, I think your detector's
off, detective.

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:02.315
Maybe you haven't been home for a while?

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:03.390
Maybe.

00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:07.330
I seen what you done to that girl.

00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:10.225
Well, there you go.

00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:12.335
I also seen the gouge in her chest.

00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:17.170
I'd lay steep odds she didn't die twice.

00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:21.805
You shouldn't be in there.

00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:24.075
If we're making a list

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:26.005
of what shouldn't be,

00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:28.615
I'm gonna need pudding.

00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:31.685
- This ain't justice.
- Justice?

00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:34.255
Justice is a fairy tale

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:37.025
they made up to keep
people like you and me

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:39.255
from executing the cunts on top.

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:40.655
Nah, that's religion.

00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:42.230
It's a lot of things.

00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:46.000
See, where I grew up,

00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:48.865
you either took

00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:50.765
or you got taken.

00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:52.235
Oi, what you doing?

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:57.345
Sorry, Detective, but...

00:34:57.350 --> 00:35:01.575
like I said, you were wrong about me.

00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:05.085
- No, you don't leave like this.
- You're a good man.

00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:06.885
You're a stupid one.

00:35:07.690 --> 00:35:09.720
But I see why Mary liked you.

00:35:11.490 --> 00:35:13.125
- You miss her?
- Fuck off.

00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:15.225
I bet you'd like to know who killed her.

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:17.025
You don't know nothing about that.

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:18.795
You can't bring back what's lost,

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.835
but you can have your say

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:22.965
before it all turns to dust.

00:35:23.770 --> 00:35:26.065
Now I am gettin' out of here...

00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:29.305
... finish what needs finishin',

00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:33.345
and I really hope I don't need
to go through you to do that.

00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:34.615
I'm a reasonable woman,

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:37.920
and I am offering you a fair exchange.

00:35:38.650 --> 00:35:40.555
Now, come on.

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:42.920
Don't make me feel I'm
exploiting a kindness.

00:35:43.930 --> 00:35:45.655
Ask me...

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:48.095
about Lord Gilbert Massen

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:51.565
and his Knights of the
Round fuckin' Table.

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:08.720
She's escaping!

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:16.625
The city swallows itself
and shits out the remains

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:18.190
every few hundred years.

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:20.525
Let them kill each other.

00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:22.295
What is the virtue of an empire

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:25.225
that cannot protect its most
vulnerable, its children?

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:28.465
This was not a child.
This was a fanatic.

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:31.335
These Purists are a headache
unto themselves.

00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:34.535
The Touched should be caged,
or better yet, eradicated.

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:37.245
- Scotland Yard...
- Scotland Yard have failed.

00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:40.615
Their special detail has
proved unspectacular.

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:44.015
- What are you driving at?
- The Prosperity of London Bill

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:46.855
is moving quickly
through the lower house.

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:49.415
I have tabled an amendment.

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:51.355
To what end?

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:53.255
Unlawful assembly.

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:55.525
Banning all gatherings
of Touched persons

00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:56.995
within city bounds.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.595
Is that not premature?

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:01.495
If the Touched cannot congregate,

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:03.535
they cannot organize.

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:05.535
They are not defenseless, as we've seen.

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:07.175
What makes you think they'll comply?

00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:09.575
Open your fucking eyes, gentlemen.

00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:11.305
He does not want compliance.

00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:14.315
Make it illegal for your enemy
to walk down the road.

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:18.115
Suddenly, your streets are clean
and your jails are filled.

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:20.015
Should be filling our gallows.

00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:22.655
One step at a time, Lord Broughton.

00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:24.425
But the General is correct.

00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:27.155
As more and more fall to delinquency,

00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:31.265
so public opinion will
continue to be eroded.

00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:33.835
Has the esteemed
Alastair Swann rejoined us,

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:36.135
or has senility got to you,
too, Lord Massen?

00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:39.505
Unless we resign ourselves

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:43.305
to immortalizing our children
further in newsprint,

00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:45.845
this is a charge that
we must shoulder together.

00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:48.515
I see. You would have us rewrite the law

00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:50.945
every time a child dies in this city.

00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:53.215
This is not about a single child.

00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:56.255
No, that much is clear. Your
motivations are personal.

00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:59.225
This dead girl reminds you of your own.

00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:02.455
Your proposal is a clumsy correction

00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:03.795
to a passing aggravation

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:07.065
and not worthy of further
debate, let alone support.

00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:09.165
Hear, hear.

00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:11.940
Now, where is that boy with our lunch?

00:38:34.330 --> 00:38:35.900
Alright, True?

00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:37.695
No.

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:42.035
Gulliver's battle plans
going well, then?

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:43.700
Fuck off!

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:09.765
Stop it.

00:39:26.850 --> 00:39:29.246
You're gonna be
a beautiful bride, Molly.

00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:36.690
Oh!

00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:39.160
Take the kids.

00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:51.735
You're rotted, Amalia!

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:53.105
I didn't know you had a brother.

00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:54.675
Four brothers. How much have you drunk?

00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:56.575
I suppose sharing has
never been our priority.

00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:58.675
No. Not like that.

00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:01.645
- Maybe we should try.
- What the fuck is going on with you, Amalia?

00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:03.115
What, y-you just smash windows

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:04.815
because you wanna talk about sharing?

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:11.320
Why do you keep doing this to me?

00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:14.755
You know I love you.

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:17.465
You must have figured that out.

00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:20.465
- I...
- And you just keep using me.

00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:22.695
I don't... Using you?

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:24.305
I think about you all the time.

00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:27.505
- I think about you, too.
- Not like this.

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:29.575
When I'm around you, when I'm not.

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:33.105
I want to be there for you.
I like it when you need me,

00:40:33.110 --> 00:40:35.075
even when I'm just a distraction.

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:36.845
But the way you float in and out,

00:40:36.850 --> 00:40:38.685
I can't do it anymore.

00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:40.215
- Brilliant.
- Amalia.

00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:42.885
No, no, no, no, no. This is...

00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:44.385
This is horseshit.

00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:46.555
I'm sorry. I know you're
not trying to hurt me...

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:48.955
Oh, stop. "I'm not trying to..."

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:50.865
You're making it sound like I'm some...

00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:52.825
- Like this is all my fault.
- It's not.

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:54.466
No, of course, it is.
Of course, it fucking is.

00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:55.571
I'm taking advantage of you.

00:40:55.575 --> 00:40:57.372
- No, I didn't mean it that way.
- How terrible I was

00:40:57.376 --> 00:41:00.311
that I wasn't in-in a-a place to just...

00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:02.335
We didn't exactly meet under nor...

00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:03.975
I was in a goddamn nut house,

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:05.905
for fuck's sake. You wanna
talk about advantage?

00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:07.615
Amalia, that was three years ago.

00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:09.445
- That's right.
- That's right!

00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:11.485
And I just told you that I love you.

00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:13.185
Right now!

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:19.025
But... and you really
can't see the difference?

00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:22.355
So what, you just want me
to... say it back?

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:23.395
No.

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:25.565
No, I want you to stop
trying to fuck me,

00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:28.135
and I want you to stop
throwing fuckin' chairs

00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:29.400
out the fuckin' window!

00:41:32.570 --> 00:41:33.840
I love you.

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:39.005
But, I love my wife, too.
And it's very different,

00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:41.415
but I can't throw away my marriage

00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:43.750
every time you're in a bad place.

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:46.350
And why the fuck not?

00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:05.835
You're having a party
for the god of harvest?

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:07.335
Is it a feast?

00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:10.105
I'm surrounded by heathens.

00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:12.545
Ceres is harvest. Harvest is labor.

00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:15.415
Labor is awful, so I'm told.

00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:18.685
I bring you Saturn, the god
of plenty and liberation.

00:42:18.690 --> 00:42:20.690
Imagine the possibilities.

00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:28.325
Ready yourselves to Mount Olympus, boys.

00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:44.610
Another hard day's drinking
with the puppet masters?

00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:49.775
I don't believe I properly thanked
you for saving my neck.

00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:51.320
At the hanging.

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:56.155
As miserable in your cups

00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:58.985
as you are in your sobriety.
How regrettable.

00:42:58.990 --> 00:43:00.725
What's regrettable

00:43:00.730 --> 00:43:03.895
is a son who contents
to play the court jester

00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:06.570
while his father gasps
his final breaths.

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:09.605
- He is dying.
- Oh...

00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:13.105
Timely cause for celebration
if ever there was one.

00:43:13.110 --> 00:43:16.605
There's no crime a parent could commit

00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:18.345
that would warrant such contempt.

00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:19.705
Perhaps.

00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:21.375
Certainly didn't stop him from trying.

00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:23.945
And your disrespect
has not gone unnoticed.

00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:25.915
Well, fortunately for me,

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:28.055
most of Alastair Swann's disciples

00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:31.155
are gasping for their own final breaths.

00:43:31.965 --> 00:43:34.526
- The wheel turns for all of us.
- I think you mean the hourglass.

00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:36.965
Including you.

00:43:36.970 --> 00:43:40.465
You were always a wayward child, Hugo.

00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:41.935
But despite your best efforts,

00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:45.205
despite the unyoked humor
of your idleness,

00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:47.175
you can neither escape your breeding

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:49.535
nor the duties that are bound to it.

00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:51.145
Well, uh,

00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:53.305
I should just try harder.

00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:56.250
Wastrels and whores
will not restore you.

00:43:57.990 --> 00:44:00.690
Family always brings us home in the end.

00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:06.990
Go and see the Duke.

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:26.180
Hm.

00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:37.090
Hm.

00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:47.870
It must be her!

00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:51.505
Hello?

00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:57.875
It's a bit rude not
to introduce yourself.

00:44:57.880 --> 00:44:59.605
Well, look, it doesn't seem fair.

00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:02.145
You know so much about me,
and I know so little about you.

00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:05.245
How about we start with the
basics? Beatles or Stones?

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:12.090
Something there, but I can't quite...

00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:15.230
It's a song or...

00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:18.030
Can you make it louder?

00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:20.565
Pen?

00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:26.910
Pen?

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:28.840
Penance.

00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:31.275
Penance!

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:32.680
Penance!

00:45:39.790 --> 00:45:41.290
What was that?

00:45:44.530 --> 00:45:46.855
Are you okay? What'd you see?

00:45:59.470 --> 00:46:02.205
Thank you for meeting
me at such short notice.

00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:05.045
Ooh.

00:46:05.050 --> 00:46:06.250
Bit bright for that, innit?

00:46:09.890 --> 00:46:11.945
There's a problem with your money.

00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:16.160
I've never had a man
short me to my eye before.

00:46:16.890 --> 00:46:18.190
It's there in full.

00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:26.125
That is a relief. I wore
my favorite shirt.

00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:28.265
Your work so far has been exemplary,

00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:30.295
but I realize I haven't provided you

00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:32.805
with adequate resources

00:46:32.810 --> 00:46:35.810
to accomplish our true goals.

00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:40.145
You wanna pay me more?

00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:42.375
You blesseds are a different breed.

00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:44.915
I'm offering to expand our relationship.

00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:46.885
Right, and what's that look like?

00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:49.715
More dead girlies for ya? More riots?

00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:50.955
More everything.

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:54.495
Well, I don't do explosives,
and I don't do assassinations.

00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:56.995
Well, nothing above a viscount.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.265
Call it double then.

00:46:59.270 --> 00:47:02.765
Our soldiers won't march for tuppence.

00:47:02.770 --> 00:47:05.605
And to rout the Touched,
you'll need an army.

00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:07.135
Mercenaries march for money.

00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:09.705
- Soldiers march for purpose.
- Right.

00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:11.805
And what do you march for?

00:47:11.810 --> 00:47:14.080
Favors. Debts.

00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:17.185
Not too many old men in my line of work.

00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:19.015
It's nice to have a friend
I can call upon

00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:21.255
in my hour of need.

00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:23.860
Couldn't tell you when exactly,
but just know one day,

00:47:24.730 --> 00:47:26.890
I'll come knockin' at your door.

00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:30.225
I don't make open-ended commitments.

00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:32.970
- Oh, is that right? Oh, well, I'll fuck off then...
- Mr. Orrun!

00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:38.570
An army for a favor.

00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:58.990
How do you know what's inside?

00:47:59.630 --> 00:48:01.055
We don't.

00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:04.160
But it's gaining form every day.

00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:08.600
Once it's open...

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.900
I can't put it back.

00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:28.645
It's hard to describe what I saw.

00:49:28.650 --> 00:49:30.545
It felt like it was part of me.

00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:50.765
- What happened?
- Something's wrong with the Galanthi.

00:49:50.770 --> 00:49:52.605
- W-what did you see?
- It's in danger.

00:49:52.610 --> 00:49:55.575
We have to go now.
We have to get to the cave.

00:49:58.350 --> 00:50:00.915
Hey. No one in or out.

00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:02.115
I appreciate your commitment,

00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:03.680
but if you could be reasonable for a...

00:50:04.850 --> 00:50:05.920
Uncalled for!

00:50:38.590 --> 00:50:41.050
Come on!

00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:35.505
Let's go, let's go! Come on! Come on!

00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:37.145
On you go, on you go!

00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:38.975
Oh!

00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:41.015
It's just labor pains.

00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:09.875
Watch it!

00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:11.640
Penance!

00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:42.680
Oh...

00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:49.945
Kill it.

00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:55.120
Kill it!

00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:57.225
Do it now!

00:53:09.775 --> 00:53:17.275
