00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:08.435
We've been through this before.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.505
Zephyr Alexis Navine.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.715
We needed you to understand.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.155
Amalia. Amalia? Amalia!

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.095
How long have I been out?

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.365
Long enough.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.875
I have to admit.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.645
I thought it would put up
more of a fight.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.065
Then the eyes of the blind

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.035
shall be opened,

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.300
and the ears of the deaf shall be...

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.010
unstoppped.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.415
Then shall the lame man leap as an hart.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.745
And the tongue of the dumb sing.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.025
You're a riddle and
a song and a delight.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.295
And I shall call you Babel.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.965
This is a house built for God!

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.300
I can feel him.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.740
Can you?

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:52.905
Here.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.975
He doesn't hurt anymore.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.275
He's just...

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.520
Your people built a tower, Babel...

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.225
all the way to Heaven.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.825
And they were after a name
for themselves as well.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.795
A name that would bind
them together forever

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.365
and ever and ever. Amen.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.130
Then, they wouldn't get lost, you see?

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.305
But I lost my friends.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.235
Clara.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.375
The Colonel.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.210
I was careless.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.250
Now, there's just the sad policeman.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.450
I have to learn to keep
the good ones safe.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.190
You?

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.425
You have to prove yourself.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.625
Everyone is tested in their time.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.730
Forged in the fire.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.500
It's funny how I didn't burn.
Maybe I can't.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.865
Maybe...

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.810
I won't.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.575
It turned out God didn't
want those people

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.915
to find out their true name.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.145
And He didn't want them
in Heaven either.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.455
He broke their tower, and He
confounded their language,

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.385
and He scattered them across the Earth,

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.795
so they would never, ever,
ever find one another again.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.525
So they would always be alone. And He...

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.880
Can you understand it, Babel?
Is it speaking?

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.550
What's it saying?

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.460
No...

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:57.835
Help.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.700
It is calling for help.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.945
And the tongue of the dumb

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.350
shall sing.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.635
Where...

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.575
is my daughter?!

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.920
You must be mistaken, my Lord!
Your daughter is dead!

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.285
I stood by you while you...

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.215
buried her for all the world to see!

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:55.690
She's with her own now.

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.765
Somewhere she should have
been a long time ago.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.340
What have you done?

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.290
You going somewhere?

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.910
Watch yourself!

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.245
Find her.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.885
Why won't it die?

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.965
- Bring me the carbine.
- Yes, run and get the big guns.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:16.295
You're not looking at all well.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.435
I'm having a bad day.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.405
I rather think that it's hurting you

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:22.005
when we hurt the creature.

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:24.835
I always suspected it,
but the doctor and I

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.745
couldn't break through
the shell to prove the theory.

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:33.615
You and Hague.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.655
Yes. Such a disappointment.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:40.285
You have no idea what
the Galanthi means to us.

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:41.685
To the future of the world.

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:44.095
I had thought that you
were immune to melodrama,

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.296
Mrs. True. That's one of the things

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.765
that appealed to me about you.

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:48.765
And, of course, I understand exactly

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:50.335
what the creature means to the Touched.

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:51.735
That's why it must die.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:53.735
No matter the cost.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.435
Including to your own brother, Lavinia?

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.905
Especially to my own brother.

00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:59.905
I'm sure you find him sweet,

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:01.545
rather awkward,

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:04.675
an eccentric soul misunderstood
by society.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:08.485
Ms. Adair, perhaps you've seen
little glimpses, little rages.

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:11.155
Augustus's anger is
not a trifling matter,

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.685
and his turn has made him deadly.

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:15.360
That is not the man I know.

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:18.060
Well, love is blind.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.695
But the veil has fallen from my eyes.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:25.500
I know now that my duty
is to cure Augustus.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.135
For your safety.

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:31.205
And for the sake of
this world that Mrs. True

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:32.905
is so concerned about.

00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:35.605
You have no way of knowing
if this will take away the turns!

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:38.875
You said it yourself!
It's just hurtin' us!

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.885
If you kill the Galanthi, you
might as well shoot us, too!

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:44.555
- What?
- My dear, I have no intention of shooting you.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.425
I merely intend for you to watch.

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:49.485
- "Shoot us, too"?
- I'm just trying to stall.

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:51.256
- I don't know what I'm supposed to say.
- Maybe something

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.295
without the downside
of getting us killed.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:56.195
How about the upside of getting us free?

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.995
Rusty nail, frayed telephone wire.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.965
- Advanced science that.
- Best kind.

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.065
- Missed you.
- I know you did.

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:29.195
Frank! Frank.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.335
Very important. Things to do.

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:32.795
We have got to get drunk.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.065
Don't worry. He's already started.

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:36.705
Frank, please join us.

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:38.035
I've, uh...

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:41.005
I've done a good thing.

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:42.475
It's a new sensation.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.745
- Harriet helped.
- Harriet helped?

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.315
She gave the speech of the
fucking century more like!

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.350
Where is she? Where's the girl?

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:55.485
Lillie, you're new here,

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:57.456
so you might not know that
everyone at the orphanage

00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:59.900
is something of a rarity.
We try not to stare.

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:02.925
Even if a person is large.

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:04.530
I think you're magnificent.

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:09.465
Frank. We won.

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:11.610
We saved the orphanage.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.445
Congratulations.

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.850
I don't think Lillie requires
our protection anymore.

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:25.250
Sooner or later, he'll
come to claim her.

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:28.125
And when he does,

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:29.330
I'll be waiting.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:32.930
You found the Primary Case Study.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.630
Well then, you can arrest Massen.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.500
That time has passed.

00:10:46.175 --> 00:10:48.440
I'm sorry I won't stand around
and watch a good man

00:10:48.445 --> 00:10:49.846
go to prison for the rest of his life

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:53.080
for the murder of some
worthless fucking toff.

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:57.855
Not when that man is somebody that I...

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:01.155
- that I care about.
- You mustn't talk that way.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.555
It's the truth. It's how I feel.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.060
It's not... real.

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:08.260
It's not possible.

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.565
This.

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:13.395
Why can't you see that?

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.835
We just brought a stag-headed girl

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.675
to an orphanage to be
looked after by a woman

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.075
with fire for hands and a...

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.210
débutante giantess!

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:25.845
I think what is possible

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:28.885
is very much up for debate.

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:38.225
- Get it over with.
- Yes, my lady.

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:51.535
And I looked, and behold a pale horse.

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:54.005
And his name that sat on him was Death.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.255
Mabel!

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:16.000
Hello, skin-shedder.

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:20.905
Bloody cowards, those carriage men.

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:23.305
- They just took off.
- You're on your mettle, girl.

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:25.535
Remember, one loyal woman
is worth more to me

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:27.105
than an army of weaklings.

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:29.910
Mabel!

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:36.620
You've been so busy recently,
haven't you?

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:41.025
All these campaigns.

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:43.030
Plans within plans within plans.

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:46.965
Honestly, you bring such
a tremendous energy,

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:48.165
to everything you do.

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:49.495
And I don't want you to think

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.340
that I'm without admiration, but...

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:55.710
You see,

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.440
sooner or later, Lavinia...

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:02.175
somebody has to stop you.

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:07.345
Otherwise, what would you become?

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:20.200
Well?

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.125
Aren't you going to shout at me?

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:25.400
Tell me how pathetic I am?

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:29.010
You could scream for help.

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:34.740
Always with the upper hand.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.880
Tell me, Lavinia.

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:44.015
Is there nothing that I could do

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.815
that might shock you?

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.400
Orrun!

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:04.775
Orrun! Are you there?

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.735
Call off your army!

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:09.445
The Purists!

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:11.975
- You must call them off!
- Call 'em off?

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:16.190
I'd sooner pipe the rats outta London.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:18.915
No.

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.925
I'm calling in that favor.

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:23.060
Do you understand me?

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:25.655
Get me the fuck...

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:28.165
outta this shithole of a city

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:30.100
before it eats itself alive.

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:34.005
- What happened here?
- What happened?

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:39.035
The doctor did his rounds.

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.505
He found out all about our little plan.

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:44.175
London must be burned!

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:46.515
London must be burned!

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:50.715
London must be burned!
London must be burned...

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:13.205
And she shall rise up from the root.

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:16.175
Get away from it.

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:17.215
If I wanted it dead,

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:19.280
I wouldn't have just
saved its life, would I?

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:26.290
Myrtle?

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:37.535
See, I'm a skin-shedder, too.

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:39.600
It's not as hard as you
like to make it look.

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:58.855
Amalia.

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:03.355
Talking isn't always telling.

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.095
- What did you see?
- The orphanage.

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.125
And what?

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:14.765
They're in danger. They don't
even have any defenses.

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:16.305
I blew the fuckin' power grid.

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:19.440
We can't just leave it here.
Not with her. Penance!

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:22.745
You have to stay.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:24.575
Help me find a way to heal it.

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:26.515
All I know is if I'm breathing my last,

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.845
and I ask myself what I did
with this life I was given,

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:31.355
I won't have it on my conscience
that I abandoned my friends.

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.760
Not when they need me most.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.500
It's always the choices
for you, isn't it?

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:01.150
If you hurt it, I will hunt you
down and cut you to shreds.

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:08.860
We all have our scars.

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:27.675
So you're just gonna have to
get used to the idea, Aneel.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.045
I'm gonna start my own practice,

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:31.015
and if that's not the kind
of wife you want,

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:33.015
then maybe I'll just have to find myself

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:36.245
- a new kind of husband.
- Well, you can't just disband the club.

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:38.216
What are your workers gonna do?
'Cause I've always said

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:40.656
- they need some kind of union.
- Well, you know what they say.

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:42.625
Every union needs
the right kind of leader.

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:45.355
Oh, trying to recruit me?

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.465
Look at all this finery.
So what do you think?

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:50.595
Or are you still just passing through?

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:52.695
Do you know, I might stay
a few more days.

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:54.035
Hm...

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.805
George? What's got into you today?

00:17:56.810 --> 00:18:00.205
Nothing. No. Just...
looking for Primrose.

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:01.580
Brought some cake.

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:35.505
He was a dragonfly when first I saw him!

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:38.645
He burned through the sky
like a silent judgment!

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:41.415
But in the water, he was small again.

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:44.115
Nothing but a singing fish. Now look.

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:47.160
Oh, he's grown so big.

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:52.025
It hurts to change.

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:53.995
I know.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.865
I know.

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:26.660
Ah...

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:28.965
Aah!

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.635
You look like the doctor,
and you smell like the doctor.

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:39.580
Somehow, you're...

00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:42.445
More.

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:45.745
- More?
- We came from the wires...

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:48.085
How many of you in there? Legion, is it?

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:52.485
You're spoiling him.

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:54.255
I was gonna wait.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.085
Seventeen, six hundred days to go.

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:57.425
It was supposed to be special!

00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:59.325
This host...

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:02.665
is... damaged.

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:04.970
But I have to do it.

00:20:04.975 --> 00:20:06.365
I'm to end this mortal coil.

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:09.405
I can't do that if I'm talking
to a fucking cipher, can I?!

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:10.875
Where's the poetry in that?!

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:21.620
Where is the...

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:38.195
I am looking for someone
to do a special study

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.295
with at my facility.

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:48.110
You must be Sarah.

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:12.370
Looks like we've got what we need...

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:18.570
for a good old-fashioned exorcism.

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:23.745
- Get the defenses up.
- No power.

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:25.715
The Purists are coming.

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.385
- Katherine! Katherine.
- Where have you been?

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:30.585
- Horatio, what happened?
- W-where's Isaiah?

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:32.720
- He's with the children. Wha...
- Okay, good.

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.585
We're under attack. So take Isaiah,

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:38.055
and find a safe place to hide
and you don't come out.

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:40.995
You understand? I need you both safe.

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:48.665
Go. Okay, go. Go. Go, go.

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:50.305
Go, go!

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:51.775
What we made of?

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:53.435
The steel in our hands,

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.105
- or the steel in our hearts?
- Yeah!

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:59.545
- Yeah!
- Let the doctor burn our fucking guns.

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:01.415
We still got blades, ain't we?

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:04.085
- Yeah!
- We still got fists and teeth!

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:05.120
Yeah!

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:06.955
Purify!

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.185
Open the door!

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:38.815
This is what we've trained for!

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:40.825
Time to use what we've been given, hm?

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:53.435
This way! Keep going!

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.040
This way! This way! This way!

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:26.100
Come on!

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:30.630
Oh, my God. Look at their face...

00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:36.370
We're losing our turns.

00:24:55.890 --> 00:24:58.025
Penance! No.

00:24:58.030 --> 00:24:59.696
- You're not going in.
- Why? We have to help them!

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:01.695
We need the defenses
back up. Make it safe.

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:03.596
Somewhere we can bring everyone.
I'll go in and get them.

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:04.865
Just go. Come on.

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:08.235
- Let me go! Let me go!
- Penance! Go.

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.640
Why are you doing this?

00:25:09.645 --> 00:25:11.870
- Why are you doing this?
- The Galanthi showed me.

00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:15.475
It showed me what...

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:18.375
what has to happen.

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:20.220
You're keeping something from me?

00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:24.085
You were keeping something
from me in the power station,

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:25.516
and you're keeping
something from me now.

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.890
- No.
- Swear it, then.

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:31.790
On my life.

00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:46.475
- Myrtle, no.
- I'm going in.

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.610
No, you're following
my orders, understood?

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:53.075
You abandoned us.

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:55.285
You risked the orphanage
for your fucking mission.

00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:57.320
Now you want me to take your orders?

00:25:58.260 --> 00:25:59.450
I'm finding my friend.

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:01.890
Myrtle, stop.

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:39.695
Mundi.

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:43.065
- You sure as hell took your time.
- Where is everyone?

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:45.696
- We sent them to hide. He's been covering.
- There's too many of them.

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:47.335
- I can't find Lillie.
- Who?

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:48.805
- You've missed a lot.
- I know.

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:49.840
Primrose?

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:54.805
Myrtle. Myr...

00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:57.810
Go after her. We'll carry
on searching down here.

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:05.755
Myrtle?

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:20.665
Purify.

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:55.370
No... Primrose...

00:27:56.610 --> 00:27:58.470
No.

00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:09.650
You came back!

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.560
I know.

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:23.665
- And you?
- I can speak.

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:26.795
I'm so glad.

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:29.905
But Myrtle, it's been terrible.

00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:33.480
I wanted to fight. I was going
to try and help them.

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:35.480
And then...

00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:38.775
- I just hid.
- It's alright.

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:41.285
Just think, you can go home now.

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:44.245
To all your real friends
and your debutante ball.

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:47.755
- You can meet the Queen.
- I don't want to meet the bloody Queen!

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:51.130
I'd only get the curtsy wrong.

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:54.625
Mother said I always did.

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:58.095
And all my friends were horrible snobs.

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:01.200
You're the only real friend
I've ever had.

00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:04.435
But of course...

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:06.880
I know your family will
have you back now, so.

00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:09.610
Didn't want me then.

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:12.110
Not gonna get me now.

00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:17.145
Well then,

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:19.785
we are not going to be orphans anymore

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:21.790
because we'll have each other, won't we?

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:24.825
Alright.

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:27.125
We can climb down, get to the gate...

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:31.565
Myrtle, we can't leave.

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:34.070
We have to try and help them.

00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:38.070
Right. We'll find Amalia.

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:48.150
Is this your best friend, Speak Freak?

00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:50.450
Remember mine, do you?

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:52.420
My Nancy.

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:55.185
I tell you what.

00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:57.855
I'm gonna make you a fair exchange.

00:29:57.860 --> 00:29:59.755
You come over here,

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:03.495
and I'm gonna put this knife in you
the way you did my Nancy.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.735
And that way,

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:08.570
your little princess here
makes it out of here alive!

00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:13.310
Myrtle, don't.

00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:19.280
- Myrtle, no!
- That's it. Come on.

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:24.220
Oh, it's gonna slide in so easy.

00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:27.460
Right up close!

00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:30.330
You don't deserve this.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.230
I do.

00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:39.370
Primrose! Primrose!

00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:45.035
No, no, no! Please! Help!

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:37.285
Amalia? Have you seen my family?

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:41.695
Fuck.

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:43.595
Can't clean this up.

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.140
Go.

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:19.895
Stay quiet. Shh, shh, shh. No sound.

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:22.565
It's alright. It's alright.

00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:23.935
What have we ever faced

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:26.036
that your good old mum
couldn't sort out, eh?

00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:36.890
Here.

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.995
The same shall drink of the wine

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.895
of the wrath of God! And their kingdom

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:51.300
will be full of darkness and torment!

00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:13.390
Come on, then.

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:16.190
Let's dance.

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:23.160
Lillie! Lillie!

00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:42.580
I know you're here.

00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:46.750
Come out.

00:33:48.190 --> 00:33:49.260
Now.

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:01.865
My God.

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:04.840
Lillie.

00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:12.675
The orphanage is overrun.
Let-let me get you to safety.

00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:16.315
No, I'd rather die than be
alone in that prison again!

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:18.550
There's no need. You don't
have to hide anymore.

00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:20.890
Hide?

00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:24.825
You locked me away!

00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:26.895
For your own good.

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:30.725
- Because I was shameful.
- No, because you were a monster.

00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:33.700
- Stop it!
- No! No!

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.305
See?

00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:37.835
The monster hasn't gone.

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:40.880
She's still here, Daddy,
and she'll always be here.

00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:42.845
No.

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:45.310
Let go of me!

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:51.655
Wouldn't do that if I was you.

00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:57.830
Go.

00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:02.566
- You're not a Purist.
- No, I ain't.

00:35:02.571 --> 00:35:05.195
- What do you want?
- Justice.

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:08.035
For the murder of Mary Brighton.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:10.135
For the torture of Sarah Eason.

00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:12.775
For the incarceration of
that little girl of yours

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:14.735
who you locked up in the dark for years

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:18.305
while she screamed and howled
and sat in her own filth.

00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:19.310
Ah!

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:22.385
There is no justice.

00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:24.245
There are no rules. There is only man

00:35:24.250 --> 00:35:26.585
and what he can bend to his will.

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:29.455
I'm afraid you put yourself
in the way of mine.

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:31.030
Aah!

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:35.725
Might have known
I'd find you in the gutter.

00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:37.395
Looking at the stars.

00:35:43.210 --> 00:35:44.570
Oh, no.

00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:28.615
You don't give up, do you?

00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:31.685
I've rebuked you, and I've bled you,

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:33.655
and I-I've cast you out in the name

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:37.455
of every heathen deity,
and yet still, you persist.

00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:43.965
What are you?

00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:45.400
Sarah...

00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:54.735
I thought you remembered everything, no?

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:57.105
The voice on the line.

00:36:57.110 --> 00:36:58.850
Whispers in the dark.

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:03.685
Mother.

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:07.690
Guided this hand.

00:37:09.830 --> 00:37:13.230
Now, we guide this flesh.

00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:19.200
And if we can't borrow, we will destroy.

00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:32.850
We cannot be contained for long.

00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:39.050
We... run... hot.

00:37:41.290 --> 00:37:43.890
The wires. That's where it came from.

00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:52.765
No.

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:57.205
Like a stream of fire from an oak.

00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:38.275
And when it was gone,

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:42.120
nothing remained but a blasted stump.

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:57.630
Mother.

00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:00.440
No.

00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:05.735
- She was inside me.
- It was a demon.

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:06.810
No...

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.850
She was a fungus.

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:13.380
Soft...

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:15.850
and spreading.

00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:18.590
More and more of her.

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:24.490
All that she never was.

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:29.400
And she never was...

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:33.365
Mother.

00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:38.335
You know, Doctor.

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:42.640
I used to think that we were
all pawns in some great game.

00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:45.915
And we don't know the rules.

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:48.385
And we can't see the players.

00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:49.680
But now, I know...

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:52.650
that there is always...

00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:55.720
a choice.

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:05.695
See who I brought to greet you.

00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:07.270
Our old friend.

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:10.640
You remember?

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:15.810
Yes, Sarah.

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:19.150
I do.

00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:14.100
And the eyes of the blind shall see.

00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:15.695
- Katherine!
- Horatio?

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:17.095
Stay inside!

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:38.045
Amalia?

00:42:38.050 --> 00:42:40.050
Amalia?

00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:45.495
Hey, hey, hey!

00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:48.195
I've died before.

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:50.900
I thought it would be
a terrible thing to do.

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:56.100
But it wasn't much in the end.

00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:03.875
Just a moment.

00:43:05.850 --> 00:43:08.150
Into the dark.

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:12.750
Fuck, fuck, fuck. Come on!

00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:45.620
Mrs. True.

00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:53.895
I'll hold you in my heart
for as long as it's beatin'.

00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:58.430
And until my last breath.

00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:05.340
I'll tell everyone your
name who comes after.

00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:08.580
If that's alright.

00:44:10.210 --> 00:44:12.550
Zephyr Alexis Navine.

00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:17.785
Who laid down her life for her friends.

00:44:22.290 --> 00:44:24.430
Death shall have no dominion.

00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:28.730
Not for us.

00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:20.720
We've been through this before.

00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:24.820
Talking isn't always telling.

00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:27.955
You gave your life for your friends

00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:30.660
because we needed you to understand...

00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:39.365
why we would do the same.

00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:19.470
You gave me a gift once.

00:46:22.210 --> 00:46:23.740
To set me free.

00:47:23.810 --> 00:47:25.870
- Frank?
- I'm here.

00:47:27.310 --> 00:47:30.410
It's alright. It's alright.

00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:34.680
It's alright.

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:51.130
That's better.

00:50:51.150 --> 00:50:53.675
You will not take our home!

00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:38.060
I didn't keep them safe.

00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:43.100
I couldn't.

00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:19.490
So is the Galanthi gone then?

00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:22.460
It was never gone.

00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:25.800
It was always here, inside us.

00:53:29.370 --> 00:53:31.510
Death shall have no dominion.

00:53:35.710 --> 00:53:37.280
That was its plan.

00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:40.780
Sacrifice.

00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:44.885
To share itself.

00:53:44.890 --> 00:53:46.450
And the spores?

00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:50.655
Not spores.

00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:51.830
Seeds.

00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:55.630
It sowed itself in us.

00:54:00.370 --> 00:54:02.200
We are Galanthi, Penance.

00:54:07.340 --> 00:54:10.040
And now, there'll be so many more.

00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:12.105
Pretty.

00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:21.960
Look! They're everywhere!

00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:25.895
More of us.

00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:30.230
To be spat at in the street
and murdered in our home.

00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:35.665
What, you think the hate
dies with the Purists?

00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:39.175
The Galanthi just took us for its own.

00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:44.545
It colonized our world without
so much as a "beg your pardon".

00:54:44.550 --> 00:54:46.875
You think any of them asked for this?

00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:50.545
- You always said the turns are gifts.
- Look!

00:54:50.550 --> 00:54:53.050
Just would you look around you!

00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:57.185
Look at what my gifts have done for us!

00:54:57.190 --> 00:54:58.655
This is it!

00:54:58.660 --> 00:55:00.725
- This is the future that was promised!
- No.

00:55:00.730 --> 00:55:02.865
We're here to change
the future, Penance.

00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:04.965
I changed a rippling.

00:55:04.970 --> 00:55:06.925
- And the Galanthi showed me...
- The Galanthi.

00:55:06.930 --> 00:55:08.540
The Galanthi has used you!

00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:16.845
And I used you.

00:55:16.850 --> 00:55:18.510
It never felt like that.

00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:21.280
Not even once.

00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:27.320
Amalia...

00:55:29.890 --> 00:55:32.590
I said that I would follow you
to the ends of the Earth.

00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:36.700
Here we are.

00:56:31.450 --> 00:56:32.545
