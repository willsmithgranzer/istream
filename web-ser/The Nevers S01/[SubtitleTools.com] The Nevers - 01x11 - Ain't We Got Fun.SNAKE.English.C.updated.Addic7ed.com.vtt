00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.335
You're gonna need it.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:20.945
No.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.150
Sorry. No.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.190
No.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.895
You're gonna need it.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.760
Oh, what the fuck is this? A sim?

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.735
Some kind of test?

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.005
A dream sequence?

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.845
Listen, the Galanthi's out,

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.975
Maladie wants to kill it,
if she hasn't already.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.445
I don't have time for a drink
with my dead selves right now.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.655
There'll be a seam where
the code doesn't match up,

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.885
and that's my way out.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.025
First stage of grief. Denial.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.595
- Doesn't she know she's dead?
- I'm not dead.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.465
You gotta consider it at least.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.195
I mean, I killed myself.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.235
Baker here killed herself.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.365
It was only a matter of time
before you joined us.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.135
Okay, how did I even get here?

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.705
I was... in the water. I was...

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.705
God makes his plans, so here we are.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.015
When you say God,

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.185
you mean the big, shiny
space elephant, right?

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.920
Because that's where our faith belongs.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.255
This isn't a sim, is it?

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.495
This is the Galanthi.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.225
It's an escape room for multiple selves.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.795
Unlock my inner battles
to see the truth or whatever.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.395
Remember when we were sent
to combat shrinks for PiTSiD?

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.335
Early days, before
they started just dosing.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.975
- Yeah 'cause that helped.
- That's what this is.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.705
Alright. I know how this works.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.740
Empathy.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.280
Hey.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.545
Wow.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:01.915
You were doing your job.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.750
Forgive yourself, and let it go.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.355
I don't know anything about you.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.125
I'm sorry that your life sucked, too.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.400
Thanks for the body.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.340
Fuck.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.390
My father refused to allow me to hunt.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.025
One summer,

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.665
I decided to become
an expert on the fox.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.140
The gamekeepers taught me every
detail of their furtive lives.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.210
I studied their prey and their range,

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.645
their habits and habitat.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.315
I learned to track them in my own time

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.975
until I found every fox's earth

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.850
within 15 miles of the house.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.755
I'd done all this,

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.720
so that when the morning came,

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.495
the horns blew.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.295
The young men took to their
steeds to follow my father,

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.565
to follow the baying pack.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.670
I already knew where the fox was going.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.670
So, I waited there.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.140
Ahead of the dogs. Ahead of the hunt.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.250
Making the kill myself.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.485
And when my father eventually arrived,

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.355
I held up that bloodied rag of an animal

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.625
and demanded his appreciation.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.495
The art of the hunt, gentlemen,
is to be ahead of the prey!

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.520
Quiet!

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.665
You pushed me!

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.165
I was a child!

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.565
We all need to be relieved
of our burdens once in a while.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.415
Help!

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:55.620
Help us, please!

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.625
Hello? Please!

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.770
Please. We need your help.
We have a Touched girl.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.435
We rescued her! She's in my carriage.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.470
It's alright. I know him. Lord Swann.

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:22.280
Please?

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.120
Yep.

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.130
- Where's Horatio?
- Where's Mrs. True?

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:43.630
So you're the toff
who runs the Ferryman's?

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:45.700
Lord Swann.

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.110
Always thought that was
a fake title, to be honest.

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:53.305
Look, I know what
you must think about me,

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:55.205
but I want her to be safe.

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.645
She deserves that at the very least.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.745
- Uh, perhaps I could make a donation?
- Does it count as a donation

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.416
if you made it off the backs
of the Touched to start with?

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.585
Uh, no, we don't need money,
Lord Swann. We need advocacy.

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.220
We need somebody to actually
pay attention to us and listen.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:17.535
No, honestly, I... I am listening.

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.195
There is an amendment going through

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.865
the House of Lords today.
You could speak out against it.

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:23.835
Whose amendment, mind my asking?

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.035
Lord Massen's.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.106
The father of the girl

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:27.950
you just kidnapped and
brought to our doorstep.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:31.775
You didn't tell me that...

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.620
- That's not gonna help things, is it?
- I think it might do.

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.520
I found this at Massen's.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.330
He was looking for a cure
for his daughter,

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.195
using some doctor

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.165
to dig around in the Touched
for an answer.

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:56.405
This woman here was
the primary case study.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:57.805
He took her from an asylum.

00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:59.475
Doctor carved her up,

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.080
but she kept on living.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.475
If I can find her,

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.620
we'll have something on Massen.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.050
Have something real.

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:12.615
You might be right,

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.225
but it's not gonna stop the amendment.

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:16.555
We need somebody in the House of Lords

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.190
to speak out against it.

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:21.600
And we need them to do it today.

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:25.365
Look...

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:28.565
The Lords is little more
than a pageant anyway.

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:31.675
Real decisions are made around
tables and smoke-filled cabals

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.575
as far from public eyes as possible.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.510
Well, so you have a seat
at any of these tables?

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:42.050
The Swanns do tend to, yes.

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:51.460
Fine.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.265
Tell me about this amendment.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.505
Have we much further to go,

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:09.605
or will I be gettin'
the full opera tonight?

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:11.815
It's by Verdi.

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:15.515
It's a beautiful auto-da-fé,
an act of penance.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.115
Do you often pay penance, Penance?

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:20.415
I have no shame in my faith

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:22.120
if you mean to imply that I should.

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:24.185
Ah...

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:27.425
We needn't be enemies, Ms. Adair.

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:31.270
I was merely pointing out the
contradiction in being a, um...

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:36.005
religious scientist.

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:38.775
No more contradictory than
a doctor who does only harm.

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:40.905
Well, science is about proof.

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:42.745
Religion is about, uh, I don't know,

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:45.615
kneeling? Prayer? Guilt?

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:49.545
Science can be like a prayer
if you ask the right questions.

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:51.555
He listens and he slowly reveals

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.590
the extraordinary plan of His universe.

00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:59.825
It really is charming.

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:03.270
This wide-eyed, earnest thing.

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:07.095
But...

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:08.870
there's no need to lie to me.

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:13.335
Soon, there will be
no secrets between...

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:14.405
the three of us.

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:15.605
Three?

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:17.345
The Holy Ghost, of course.

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:19.845
Oh, don't frown!

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:21.785
We'll be there soon.

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:24.890
A communion that will...
enrapture us all.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.125
Alright!

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:38.935
Whoa!

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:50.875
And... now.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:02.755
Oh! You've already met my boys.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.955
Yeah. Yes. Many times.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.765
Oh, yes. I have you and your, uh,

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:09.500
your friend to thank

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:12.495
for all of those repairs.

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.665
You should know that I won't leave
my conscience at the door

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:17.310
just to satisfy curiosity.

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:22.880
Look...

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:25.315
Eve is in the garden, right?

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.815
And the snake comes to her
with the apple.

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.545
All of that knowledge,
all of that power,

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:32.885
in exchange for just one mouthful.

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:35.955
And humanity bears the burden
of that sin forever after.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.060
It's not the compelling argument
you think it is.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.165
How's this for a compelling argument?

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.075
Your holy book says

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.045
Eve takes a bite of that apple,

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:01.615
gives some to her fella,
and paradise ends!

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:03.285
I say...

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:05.515
Eve chomps down on that fruit,

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.485
and everything begins!

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.865
You keep acting like a beast,
and we will treat you as one.

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:37.750
Can you speak?

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:42.625
How do you do that?

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:44.190
What, this?

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:47.160
Practice.

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:49.325
Control.

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:54.635
Discipline.

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.170
All things you can learn here.

00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:59.105
My father said I was the only one.

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:02.640
No, darling. You ain't special.

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:06.620
What was it like?

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.720
With your family, when they found out.

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:19.430
I had three sisters.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.000
Younger ones. Annoying.

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:28.770
Stubborn. Bit scary.

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:31.035
You'd have liked them.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.105
We were on our own. We didn't have much.

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:35.205
We did alright for a while. Then...

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:38.050
there was one winter
where it was just...

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:41.645
so cold.

00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:47.315
I tried to keep them warm,
to keep them safe, but...

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.690
They died.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:52.890
Yeah.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:04.110
I'd have given anything
to have had this gift back then.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.480
I wish I could make fire.

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.615
I could burn down my house.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.145
Burn down that prison.

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:18.685
And the past.

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:21.220
The past is where we learn.

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:25.225
And where we hurt.

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:26.860
I want it all in ashes.

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:34.395
What on Earth is that?

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.265
- I'll tell you what it isn't.
- I...

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:39.240
No, I think I'd rather you
tell me what it is.

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:44.750
Yes.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.115
Hugo, hey.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.491
- Oh, fuck.
- You wear this earpiece,

00:14:50.495 --> 00:14:51.785
and I'll wear the other one,

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:55.060
and that way, I can feed you
the arguments when you get lost.

00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:57.490
You can't be serious.

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:00.865
This will never work.

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:04.295
These people loathe me.

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:06.765
Massen considers me
the scourge of his class.

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:10.265
He and his cronies won't listen
to anything I have to say,

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:12.875
no matter how convincing
your demagogy is.

00:15:13.579 --> 00:15:15.476
Anyone can win an argument,
you just need to know

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.945
what the other person wants.
If you had any integrity...

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:20.815
Integrity is a luxury of
the poor. I have none.

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:23.015
You have the wrong man for the task.

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:26.120
I'm sorry, but this
is a terrible mistake.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.625
No! No, no, no, no, no.

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:31.930
This is your responsibility!

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:36.395
You're afraid.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.795
Wha...

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.935
Why did you save that little girl?

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.835
Because it seemed like
the humane thing to do!

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:45.035
- You took a risk.
- A risk?!

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.275
Do you not see what he was doing to her?

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:50.045
She adored him, and he put
her in a cage like an animal!

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:51.450
A monster!

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:01.625
My father was exactly the same.

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:05.025
My only regret about his death
is that I didn't actually

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:07.530
ever get to tell him
that he was the monster.

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:17.910
So...

00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:31.920
Carpe bloody diem.

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:37.455
Ow!

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:39.855
- Ow!
- Oh, shit. Sorry.

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:42.900
Ow! Really ow!

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:12.415
Please, we don't have much.
Take whatever you want.

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:13.790
Please don't hurt me.

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:25.595
Oh...

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.065
You've come for tea you, haven't you?

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:29.935
Well,

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:33.040
we'll just have to make do
with bread and butter.

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:43.945
This is your house.

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:47.215
Yes. Oh, we've lived here for years.

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:50.155
Only, well, I've been away, you see.

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:53.960
So I'm all at sixes and sevens.
Won't you sit down?

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:18.590
Can you feel her?

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:24.255
Is she reaching out to you?

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:30.695
Huh? Telling you what she needs?

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.565
- She?
- Oh.

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:37.270
I cannot wait to finally introduce you.

00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:40.205
My mother.

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:45.650
Right. Sorry.

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:50.485
Sit.

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:54.460
Sit!

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:04.095
Mother's only half there.

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:07.535
In the wires. You can feel
her. It's just her spirit.

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:09.435
It's just her-her-her trembling soul,

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.305
but you can finish this.

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:13.805
And then we can divert all
that energy into a new body,

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:17.245
and we can prise her
from the maw of death itself.

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:20.275
That's what you were trying
to do with... your boys?

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.245
Yes! Exactly.

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:24.515
Early attempts. Crude.

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:27.455
I don't have your expertise, you see?

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:29.520
I'm just a doctor!

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:33.995
I could not get the transfer right,

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.265
and humans aren't strong enough
for the Grand Dame.

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:40.635
She roasted them
inside out within hours,

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.000
but I found uses for them.

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.905
I can't abide waste.

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:47.835
What of the souls
already in those bodies?

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:52.775
Oh, just a casualty of science, my dear.

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:54.920
Souls aren't the domain of science.

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:25.715
This is where our two beliefs meet.

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:38.725
- No...
- God makes his plans,

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:41.995
- so here we are.
- So, here we are.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:53.205
The problem is, if we fall back,

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:55.675
Freelife catches up before
we make it to the pods.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.705
And if we don't,

00:21:57.710 --> 00:22:01.115
they have twice the numbers,
so they just...

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.885
just pick us off.

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:04.815
So, what did you do?

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:07.685
She left her husband and her wife

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:10.185
and 30 others

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:12.795
to hold the line while she
and two other high ranks

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:14.060
got out of Edinburgh.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.535
Last surrender of that war

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:23.200
for us that wasn't just...

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:25.935
losing.

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.405
It was just losing them.

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:37.420
I...

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:41.825
I couldn't take them with me.

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:44.090
But you never quite managed
to leave them behind.

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:46.855
All that guilt.

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:49.660
All those ghosts.

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:54.140
Nothing that an ice-cold can of necro

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:56.535
couldn't fix.

00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:58.135
It isn't funny. You killed yourself.

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:00.235
We killed ourselves.

00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:10.085
You know,

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:12.385
when I was down there in the water,

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:16.730
sinking deeper and deeper,
I remember thinking...

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:21.295
What?

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:23.800
Before it ended, I remember wishing

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:26.170
another chance.

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:29.740
Another breath.

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:31.970
One more...

00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:36.440
Is that how you felt?

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:38.715
- No.
- No.

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:49.950
I'm sorry we haven't any tea.

00:23:49.955 --> 00:23:51.555
That was our only teapot.

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:53.455
Lester will be so disappointed.

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:55.930
Where is your husband?

00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:00.435
- Missus...
- Eason. We did say.

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:03.305
Of course, he did. I did know.

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:05.075
I simply can't remember.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:08.010
Oh!

00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:12.315
Oh. It's tough.

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:27.765
D-does Mr. Eason have any
concerns about your memory?

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:33.195
He says I haven't been
the same since the sanatorium.

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:43.980
I can't remember where he...

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:46.545
Hm.

00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:50.450
Does Strohman's Asylum ring any bells?

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:56.955
That was the first one. The nice one.

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.160
The other, I don't remember it so well.

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:04.395
Do you remember a Dr. Hague?

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:07.370
Was he the American gentleman?
Americans are very polite.

00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:11.135
Do you like jam? I love it.

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:13.980
I once ate a whole pot.

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:17.110
But don't tell Lester.

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:21.215
Please, don't tell Lester.

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:30.785
Don't draw attention to it.

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:33.090
Mm, I draw enough attention as it is.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.165
And do not let them bait
you or talk over you.

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:39.400
- Remember, you're one of them.
- Well...

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:42.265
that's what worries me.

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:45.975
If we maintain a high alert
without panicking the populace,

00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:48.435
we can bring this matter
under control swiftly.

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:50.805
However, the last thing we need

00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:53.545
is any interruption from
gangs of the Touched.

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:56.285
They must know that there is
no strength in numbers.

00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:59.750
Only punishment. We must ensure
this amendment is passed now.

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:10.125
This isn't about politics, man.

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:12.535
This situation is
completely unprecedented.

00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:15.865
All the more reason
to trust in politics.

00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:17.505
Even without unanimous consent,

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:20.335
it appears we have the votes.

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:21.575
Um,

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.075
not all the votes.

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.105
What are you doing, Swann?

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:28.545
Taking my father's seat
where he is unable to attend.

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:31.215
Your father is dead.

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.615
Well, then I may be here for some time.

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:37.025
He has the right.
And the Prince is absent.

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:40.155
Bettina's lumbago has
a curious tendency to flare

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:42.795
when our meetings concern the Touched.

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:44.995
I'm afraid you're a little late, Swann.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.620
Our business here is all but concluded.

00:26:47.625 --> 00:26:51.090
It is the will of this assembly
that the Touched amendment

00:26:51.095 --> 00:26:54.165
to the Prosperity of London Bill
be passed tonight.

00:26:58.935 --> 00:27:00.600
Hurry up.

00:27:00.605 --> 00:27:01.630
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:27:01.635 --> 00:27:03.205
So, um, ahem...

00:27:04.645 --> 00:27:06.140
Gentlemen.

00:27:06.145 --> 00:27:07.670
Gentlemen.

00:27:08.575 --> 00:27:12.080
We have all seen the
unrest in the streets

00:27:12.085 --> 00:27:13.580
following Maladie's hanging.

00:27:13.585 --> 00:27:16.650
We all care about
the safety of our citizens.

00:27:16.655 --> 00:27:20.090
We all care for the safety
of our citizens.

00:27:20.095 --> 00:27:23.460
But the problems were
not caused by her death,

00:27:23.465 --> 00:27:26.790
but rather by those
of us in power intent

00:27:26.795 --> 00:27:29.400
on making a spectacle of the Touched.

00:27:30.205 --> 00:27:33.030
It comes as no surprise that
you would attack your peers

00:27:33.035 --> 00:27:35.270
to defend dissidents and terrorists.

00:27:35.275 --> 00:27:37.240
Terrorists?

00:27:37.245 --> 00:27:39.840
But, do you know how many
of the Touched are children?

00:27:39.845 --> 00:27:41.910
Do you know how many of
the Touched are children?

00:27:41.915 --> 00:27:43.180
Where are they to go?

00:27:43.185 --> 00:27:45.750
Your new law makes their only safe haven

00:27:45.755 --> 00:27:47.950
- in this city illegal.
- Oh, be quiet,

00:27:47.955 --> 00:27:50.220
you bloody reprobate.
I've half a mind to show you...

00:27:50.225 --> 00:27:51.521
The fact that you have a mind at all

00:27:51.525 --> 00:27:53.250
is the most debatable topic
at this table.

00:27:53.655 --> 00:27:55.920
This is not vaudeville, Swann.

00:27:55.925 --> 00:27:57.421
- Mm.
- Stop it.

00:27:57.425 --> 00:27:59.160
You need to get them on your side, Hugo.

00:27:59.165 --> 00:28:01.365
The beast itself is on the loose.

00:28:06.205 --> 00:28:07.835
Yes, sorry. Sorry.

00:28:10.245 --> 00:28:12.770
What's happening? What is it?

00:28:12.775 --> 00:28:15.010
Sorry, w-what am I looking at?

00:28:15.015 --> 00:28:18.110
A monster of unknown power and ferocity.

00:28:18.115 --> 00:28:20.480
Are you sure? 'Cause this just...

00:28:20.485 --> 00:28:23.420
We do not have the luxury
of debating this further.

00:28:23.425 --> 00:28:26.250
Those who are capable of finding
and eliminating this threat

00:28:26.255 --> 00:28:27.690
must be allowed to do so

00:28:27.695 --> 00:28:30.890
without intervention from
your verminous Touched.

00:28:35.265 --> 00:28:36.295
Hm...

00:28:37.335 --> 00:28:38.600
Hang on.

00:28:39.905 --> 00:28:42.505
You're no stranger to monsters,
though, are you?

00:28:43.445 --> 00:28:44.705
Lord Massen?

00:28:48.775 --> 00:28:51.180
No, no, no, no, no, no.
This isn't what we discussed.

00:28:51.185 --> 00:28:53.215
This isn't what we're supposed
to be doing, Hugo.

00:28:56.385 --> 00:28:59.950
You shame yourself and your
family name with this display.

00:28:59.955 --> 00:29:02.150
Indeed, I know shame...

00:29:02.155 --> 00:29:04.720
What are you doing? Stop it!

00:29:04.725 --> 00:29:06.530
Which of us here does not?

00:29:06.535 --> 00:29:09.230
I know for a fact that
behind closed doors,

00:29:09.235 --> 00:29:11.830
many of you have embraced the Touched

00:29:11.835 --> 00:29:13.930
as intimately as you would any other.

00:29:13.935 --> 00:29:15.870
No, not like this, Hugo!

00:29:15.875 --> 00:29:18.770
What about you, Lord Massen?
Do you deign to drag

00:29:18.775 --> 00:29:20.710
- your shame into the light?
- Get out!

00:29:20.715 --> 00:29:22.511
Or does the veil of your
virtue conceal nothing

00:29:22.515 --> 00:29:25.085
- but rank hypocrisy?
- You always were a fucking disgrace!

00:29:26.615 --> 00:29:28.180
Stop!

00:29:28.185 --> 00:29:29.280
Hugo!

00:29:35.695 --> 00:29:36.955
Forgive me.

00:29:38.965 --> 00:29:41.660
One of your courtesans, I suppose.

00:29:49.905 --> 00:29:51.575
I know you think me immoral.

00:29:52.915 --> 00:29:54.215
Hopeless.

00:29:55.275 --> 00:29:56.410
Perhaps I am.

00:29:57.215 --> 00:29:59.950
But somehow today,
it falls to me to remind you

00:29:59.955 --> 00:30:02.580
that the decisions
made around this table

00:30:02.585 --> 00:30:04.825
affect the lives of millions.

00:30:11.665 --> 00:30:13.495
Will you please just listen.

00:30:15.865 --> 00:30:17.730
So,

00:30:17.735 --> 00:30:20.635
you see it now? He's
in league with them!

00:30:21.375 --> 00:30:22.535
Oh dear...

00:30:23.045 --> 00:30:24.045
My, um...

00:30:24.845 --> 00:30:26.270
My Lords,

00:30:26.275 --> 00:30:28.975
it is not my intention to offend you.

00:30:30.815 --> 00:30:33.210
But as we are on trial

00:30:33.215 --> 00:30:35.355
in the court of your good opinion,

00:30:36.455 --> 00:30:39.550
I should like to make my case.

00:30:40.455 --> 00:30:41.650
Hm.

00:30:46.235 --> 00:30:48.060
Just last month, there was a fire

00:30:48.065 --> 00:30:50.560
in an Islington boarding house.
It burned so suddenly,

00:30:50.565 --> 00:30:53.230
so fiercely, that the place
would have been in cinders

00:30:53.235 --> 00:30:55.200
before the fire brigade could reach it.

00:30:55.205 --> 00:30:57.640
Yet, there was a young Touched man

00:30:57.645 --> 00:31:00.710
walking by who had the ability
to generate water.

00:31:00.715 --> 00:31:02.740
He put the fire out on his own.

00:31:02.745 --> 00:31:05.715
Saved dozens of lives
because he was free to do so.

00:31:07.415 --> 00:31:10.550
Imagine if your wife
had been in that house.

00:31:10.555 --> 00:31:11.790
Your child.

00:31:12.795 --> 00:31:13.820
You.

00:31:14.525 --> 00:31:16.361
But you'd lock that young man
away for the crime

00:31:16.365 --> 00:31:18.395
of nothing more than his existence.

00:31:19.995 --> 00:31:22.930
You have the most uniquely
powerful group of people

00:31:22.935 --> 00:31:26.630
humanity has ever recorded here, now,

00:31:26.635 --> 00:31:28.500
in your city.

00:31:29.205 --> 00:31:30.735
Why would you send us away?

00:31:32.915 --> 00:31:35.340
A single Touched can save
a burning building.

00:31:35.345 --> 00:31:38.910
Another can translate
languages of all nations

00:31:38.915 --> 00:31:42.720
and facilitate trade,
end war, sow harmony.

00:31:42.725 --> 00:31:44.880
There are others with
unmatched strength,

00:31:44.885 --> 00:31:48.190
and some, as you know,
with sight into the future itself.

00:31:52.565 --> 00:31:55.600
Imagine what future we might see

00:31:55.605 --> 00:31:57.830
if we were to work together

00:31:59.235 --> 00:32:01.275
rather than let fear keep us apart.

00:32:27.765 --> 00:32:30.101
Mother, Mother, Mother, here she comes.

00:32:30.105 --> 00:32:32.100
Mother, Mother, Mother, I can't wait.

00:32:32.105 --> 00:32:34.800
I-I can always see
where energy wants to go.

00:32:36.605 --> 00:32:38.745
This is different.

00:32:40.245 --> 00:32:42.310
I can see what it wants to be.

00:32:44.015 --> 00:32:46.210
The current's so strong,

00:32:46.215 --> 00:32:47.850
I don't even know what could contain it.

00:32:47.855 --> 00:32:50.950
Well, uncharacteristically
theatrical of me,

00:32:50.955 --> 00:32:53.520
I know, but there is a reveal!

00:32:53.525 --> 00:32:56.160
The perfect host.

00:32:56.165 --> 00:32:57.460
Wah!

00:33:01.635 --> 00:33:02.760
Oh, it can't be.

00:33:06.775 --> 00:33:08.000
Where did you find it?

00:33:08.005 --> 00:33:10.900
Only the best for Mother,
don't you agree?

00:33:10.905 --> 00:33:14.470
I mean, we don't want her
to end up in a, mm, what?

00:33:14.475 --> 00:33:16.280
A hay penny baker.

00:33:16.285 --> 00:33:18.310
- What?
- Oh.

00:33:18.815 --> 00:33:20.850
I nearly forgot your incentive!

00:33:25.455 --> 00:33:27.695
- Amalia?!
- Ah, no, no, no, no, no, no...

00:33:32.125 --> 00:33:35.330
I knew the voice was off.
I was so annoyed with Mother

00:33:35.335 --> 00:33:37.560
when I found out that
Mrs. True was a transplant,

00:33:37.565 --> 00:33:41.100
ripped out of, uh, the afterlife
and stuffed into some dead girl.

00:33:41.105 --> 00:33:43.201
Now, I might have been able
to get Mother out of the wires

00:33:43.205 --> 00:33:44.441
without your help if I'd been able

00:33:44.445 --> 00:33:45.671
to look into your friend's head.

00:33:45.675 --> 00:33:47.070
Maybe...

00:33:47.075 --> 00:33:49.840
Maybe I still will,
if this doesn't work out.

00:33:49.845 --> 00:33:51.405
I swear to God, if you hurt her...

00:33:52.085 --> 00:33:53.745
Well, she's in your hands now.

00:33:58.155 --> 00:34:00.225
Fine. I'll do it.

00:34:03.425 --> 00:34:04.965
I never doubted you.

00:34:06.935 --> 00:34:10.260
Did Dr. Hague ever
bring anybody to see you?

00:34:10.265 --> 00:34:12.470
They said I couldn't have visitors.

00:34:13.575 --> 00:34:15.200
That's why I never saw Lester.

00:34:15.205 --> 00:34:17.440
The doctor's work was
too important to share.

00:34:17.445 --> 00:34:18.800
Well, that's what he said.

00:34:18.805 --> 00:34:20.940
Though he did get
telephone calls sometimes.

00:34:20.945 --> 00:34:22.510
Yeah? Who from?

00:34:22.515 --> 00:34:24.240
Well, his mother, mostly.

00:34:24.245 --> 00:34:26.885
She was a right old nag,
as Lester would say.

00:34:28.685 --> 00:34:30.085
Said.

00:34:30.925 --> 00:34:31.925
Says.

00:34:36.095 --> 00:34:37.920
And there was a man, too,

00:34:37.925 --> 00:34:40.330
with a big stern voice that boomed.

00:34:40.335 --> 00:34:42.291
And he never said sorry,
and he never said please.

00:34:42.295 --> 00:34:45.130
He just ordered the doctor about.

00:34:45.135 --> 00:34:47.370
Always put him in a foul mood.

00:34:47.375 --> 00:34:49.570
He'd get out his tray
with all the silver pieces

00:34:49.575 --> 00:34:51.205
after the stern man called.

00:34:52.575 --> 00:34:53.845
To cheer himself up.

00:34:59.685 --> 00:35:02.150
Do you remember anything else

00:35:02.155 --> 00:35:04.920
about the... the stern man?

00:35:07.895 --> 00:35:09.095
I remember the pain.

00:35:11.795 --> 00:35:14.135
Did they find what they was lookin' for?

00:35:16.865 --> 00:35:18.205
Nobody ever said.

00:35:20.405 --> 00:35:22.075
I'm not sure that was fair.

00:35:23.705 --> 00:35:24.945
No.

00:35:26.675 --> 00:35:28.510
No, I don't think it was.

00:35:28.515 --> 00:35:30.540
I like talking to you.

00:35:30.545 --> 00:35:32.240
Bet you're nice to your wife.

00:35:32.245 --> 00:35:33.650
You got children?

00:35:33.655 --> 00:35:34.715
No.

00:35:35.755 --> 00:35:37.050
Shame.

00:35:37.755 --> 00:35:39.325
You'd be a good father.

00:35:41.325 --> 00:35:43.355
Can see that. Sad eyes.

00:35:44.665 --> 00:35:46.390
Kind, soft bit in the corner.

00:35:50.005 --> 00:35:53.005
You look like someone who
wants to do the right thing.

00:35:56.705 --> 00:35:58.945
It's hard to know that sometimes.

00:36:00.245 --> 00:36:01.315
What?

00:36:03.485 --> 00:36:04.745
The right thing.

00:36:30.905 --> 00:36:32.140
Upstairs.

00:36:32.145 --> 00:36:33.710
- No. I...
- Now!

00:36:35.645 --> 00:36:38.880
I... Please. Please, sir.

00:36:42.625 --> 00:36:44.780
I think we should wait for my husband.

00:36:44.785 --> 00:36:46.850
I really, really think
we should wait for Lester.

00:36:46.855 --> 00:36:49.460
- You said you didn't know where he was.
- No.

00:36:49.465 --> 00:36:51.420
I said I didn't remember.

00:36:51.425 --> 00:36:53.730
Up you go... Maladie.

00:36:53.735 --> 00:36:56.460
Good game though.

00:36:56.465 --> 00:36:59.035
Eh? Lovely tea party.

00:36:59.875 --> 00:37:01.430
Lester mentioned a Maladie at dinner.

00:37:01.435 --> 00:37:03.740
He reads the papers to me sometimes.

00:37:03.745 --> 00:37:05.540
She wasn't very nice, was she?

00:37:05.545 --> 00:37:07.040
No.

00:37:07.045 --> 00:37:09.710
She killed a lot of people. Go.

00:37:11.585 --> 00:37:13.110
Go on!

00:37:25.295 --> 00:37:27.565
Open the door.

00:37:28.135 --> 00:37:29.195
Please...

00:37:31.665 --> 00:37:34.100
Open the fucking door.

00:37:39.615 --> 00:37:41.370
Oh no!

00:37:41.375 --> 00:37:43.540
No, no... Jesus Christ!
No! What have you...

00:37:43.545 --> 00:37:45.026
- What have you fucking done?!
- Don't remember...

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:46.230
Get on the fucking floor!

00:37:46.235 --> 00:37:47.900
No, no, no.

00:37:47.905 --> 00:37:49.680
No, I thought she killed me!

00:37:49.685 --> 00:37:52.180
So, I kept quiet and stayed very still.

00:37:52.185 --> 00:37:54.290
But then, God was reborn,
and she got close to him.

00:37:54.295 --> 00:37:56.360
But he told her a beautiful secret.

00:37:56.365 --> 00:37:59.860
Our curse. It wasn't
a curse. It was a gift.

00:37:59.865 --> 00:38:02.730
And we didn't need to hide
from it. It was to protect us.

00:38:02.735 --> 00:38:05.260
- So, I woke up and...
- You ain't a fucking housewife!

00:38:05.265 --> 00:38:06.470
I am not her either.

00:38:06.475 --> 00:38:08.970
This ain't a fucking game no more!

00:38:08.975 --> 00:38:11.400
No. No, it is not.

00:38:11.805 --> 00:38:13.040
It's not a game.

00:38:13.045 --> 00:38:15.410
This is another bad place.

00:38:15.415 --> 00:38:17.540
It's another bright light

00:38:17.545 --> 00:38:19.410
and tray of silver pieces,

00:38:19.415 --> 00:38:22.080
just... just pick,

00:38:22.085 --> 00:38:23.980
picking through everything inside,

00:38:23.985 --> 00:38:26.920
until it burns like rapture!

00:38:26.925 --> 00:38:30.090
God gave Maladie power
because men gave Sarah pain,

00:38:30.095 --> 00:38:32.860
and now, they're both here,
and I don't know!

00:38:32.865 --> 00:38:35.030
Nobody ever told me
who I was supposed to be

00:38:35.035 --> 00:38:37.065
after they ripped me in two!

00:38:39.335 --> 00:38:41.770
But you won't understand.

00:39:02.455 --> 00:39:04.990
Here. Here.

00:39:04.995 --> 00:39:08.165
Listen to me.

00:39:11.235 --> 00:39:12.800
Keep still.

00:39:13.605 --> 00:39:15.735
Stay there.

00:39:18.775 --> 00:39:20.205
I'm sitting here.

00:39:22.145 --> 00:39:23.315
There.

00:39:35.755 --> 00:39:37.295
Aren't you gonna arrest me?

00:39:38.695 --> 00:39:40.930
The world can ask a lot from us.

00:39:40.935 --> 00:39:42.895
Sometimes too much.

00:39:46.235 --> 00:39:48.200
You forget who you are.

00:39:51.145 --> 00:39:55.145
You're the soft, kind bit
in the corner, I think.

00:39:57.615 --> 00:39:59.615
Even Maladie knew.

00:40:00.885 --> 00:40:02.455
Mary told her.

00:40:17.935 --> 00:40:20.635
I once heard you say
I should get justice.

00:40:26.675 --> 00:40:28.940
Mm.

00:40:32.345 --> 00:40:34.980
They died in Edinburgh,

00:40:34.985 --> 00:40:36.885
watching us leave.

00:40:40.795 --> 00:40:43.395
Their eyes on our back.

00:40:44.925 --> 00:40:47.160
You don't know that they saw us.

00:40:47.165 --> 00:40:50.230
No, her eyes on us.

00:40:51.135 --> 00:40:52.605
Watching us.

00:40:53.905 --> 00:40:56.470
Bullet bursting between
'em every night after...

00:40:56.475 --> 00:40:59.770
Between 'em every night after.

00:41:03.945 --> 00:41:06.380
Do you remember... Do you remember...

00:41:06.385 --> 00:41:08.415
Do you remember...

00:41:09.255 --> 00:41:11.480
the last thing he said?

00:41:12.185 --> 00:41:13.750
Don't fucking say it,

00:41:13.755 --> 00:41:16.190
- Don't fucking say it.
- You...

00:41:16.195 --> 00:41:18.820
- No.
- You are never,

00:41:18.825 --> 00:41:20.890
never, never

00:41:20.895 --> 00:41:22.690
getting outta here.

00:41:28.175 --> 00:41:30.770
I cannot believe
you would waste our time

00:41:30.775 --> 00:41:32.840
- with such petty, childish squabbling.
- Harriet...

00:41:32.845 --> 00:41:35.010
This might be just a laugh
to you, but it is my life,

00:41:35.015 --> 00:41:36.341
- and the life of countless others...
- Harriet.

00:41:36.345 --> 00:41:37.511
... that you have put in the balance!

00:41:37.515 --> 00:41:38.680
Harriet!

00:41:40.115 --> 00:41:41.655
The nays have it.

00:41:42.755 --> 00:41:44.080
Wha...

00:41:44.085 --> 00:41:45.325
Thanks to you.

00:41:55.735 --> 00:41:59.300
Tell the king of rats there
is to be no more waiting.

00:41:59.305 --> 00:42:01.535
His army marches at dawn.

You one of us now?

00:43:29.925 --> 00:43:32.825
No, darlin'. You're one of me.

00:43:47.945 --> 00:43:49.440
Is it working?

00:43:49.445 --> 00:43:52.215
I have to gather the energy.

00:44:21.715 --> 00:44:23.710
Oh, Jesus.

00:44:23.715 --> 00:44:27.080
Oh... Oh...

00:44:27.085 --> 00:44:29.585
You... What?

00:45:24.175 --> 00:45:26.300
Hello, dear.

00:45:31.115 --> 00:45:33.245
You're from the future. Uh...

00:45:33.815 --> 00:45:35.680
From Amalia's time?

00:45:36.285 --> 00:45:38.580
We only met the once,

00:45:38.585 --> 00:45:40.720
when she was a soldier.

00:45:40.725 --> 00:45:42.925
We fought on the same side.

00:45:45.365 --> 00:45:47.190
What is she saying?

00:45:47.195 --> 00:45:51.165
S-so y-your mission was
to protect the Galanthi?

00:45:52.565 --> 00:45:54.630
It was, but...

00:45:55.335 --> 00:45:59.000
I've had a lot of time to think
it through, sweetheart.

00:46:01.015 --> 00:46:04.680
The Galanthi were heralded as saviors.

00:46:05.085 --> 00:46:07.480
But what did they actually achieve?

00:46:07.485 --> 00:46:11.380
Everything only got worse
after they arrived.

00:46:12.485 --> 00:46:15.490
People made it worse.
It wasn't the Galanthi's fault.

00:46:15.495 --> 00:46:18.860
What about all the lives
in that orphanage of yours?

00:46:18.865 --> 00:46:20.730
Have the Galanthi helped them?

00:46:21.535 --> 00:46:23.760
And look.

00:46:23.765 --> 00:46:26.505
Who knows what they've
done to your friend.

00:46:29.775 --> 00:46:31.870
Or if she'll even wake up.

00:46:32.575 --> 00:46:34.670
The Galanthi would never hurt Amalia.

00:46:34.675 --> 00:46:38.510
It may not mean to hurt someone.

00:46:38.515 --> 00:46:40.715
But that doesn't mean it didn't.

00:46:42.015 --> 00:46:43.720
Doesn't mean it won't.

00:46:44.525 --> 00:46:48.050
Are you willing to gamble
on good intentions?

00:46:49.925 --> 00:46:52.160
I don't even know what
your intentions are.

00:46:52.965 --> 00:46:54.660
You're not betting on me.

00:46:55.565 --> 00:46:57.595
I'm betting on you.

00:46:58.765 --> 00:47:02.300
It is no sin to consider

00:47:02.305 --> 00:47:05.200
what a little thing like yourself

00:47:05.205 --> 00:47:08.010
might do with such knowledge.

00:47:10.045 --> 00:47:14.510
I'd love to see the good you could do,

00:47:14.515 --> 00:47:16.085
Penance Adair,

00:47:17.155 --> 00:47:21.120
with all the future's technology

00:47:21.125 --> 00:47:23.560
at your fingertips.

00:47:28.135 --> 00:47:32.005
More good than
any Galanthi has ever done.

00:47:33.975 --> 00:47:35.405
Don't you think?

00:47:48.685 --> 00:47:50.280
This is just like you.

00:47:50.285 --> 00:47:51.720
Drunk off your ass!

00:47:53.025 --> 00:47:54.890
Chasing a fucking mission that you knew,

00:47:54.895 --> 00:47:57.420
deep in your heart, never even existed.

00:47:57.425 --> 00:47:58.920
You had a chance at life

00:47:58.925 --> 00:48:01.590
with love and music...

00:48:03.905 --> 00:48:05.730
... dresses fit for a lady,

00:48:05.735 --> 00:48:07.000
and you wasted it!

00:48:08.105 --> 00:48:10.370
Left everyone behind. Again!

00:48:10.375 --> 00:48:12.070
And what did you do

00:48:12.075 --> 00:48:14.070
with this life that you were given?

00:48:14.075 --> 00:48:16.510
- He's going to help.
- What did you do?!

00:48:18.385 --> 00:48:19.910
Hm? What did you do?!

00:48:21.015 --> 00:48:23.110
Where to then?

00:48:23.115 --> 00:48:24.320
No way out but through.

00:48:44.205 --> 00:48:45.775
I told someone our name.

00:48:52.985 --> 00:48:55.115
I told someone our name.

00:49:16.805 --> 00:49:18.535
You're not Mary.

00:49:19.405 --> 00:49:20.905
This isn't about me.

00:49:23.315 --> 00:49:25.040
And all this was...

00:49:25.945 --> 00:49:27.750
For you.

00:49:27.755 --> 00:49:29.385
And...

00:49:31.585 --> 00:49:33.085
is there anything else?

00:49:37.465 --> 00:49:40.565
Please, I am listening. Just...

00:49:42.065 --> 00:49:43.760
talk to me.

00:49:43.765 --> 00:49:45.905
We've been through this before.

00:49:47.435 --> 00:49:50.000
Talking isn't always telling.

00:50:05.055 --> 00:50:07.850
We never really know
what we're living for

00:50:07.855 --> 00:50:09.955
until we know what we'd die for.

00:50:30.385 --> 00:50:31.545
Oh...

00:50:55.105 --> 00:50:57.000
All of her will need
to leave the circuit.

00:50:57.005 --> 00:50:58.370
Otherwise, we'll risk losing...

00:50:59.745 --> 00:51:01.170
- bits.
- No, no, no!

00:51:01.175 --> 00:51:04.210
Not one molecule of
Mother can go to waste.

00:51:12.355 --> 00:51:14.225
Ah! We're losing power.

00:51:15.155 --> 00:51:16.690
Ah!

00:51:17.495 --> 00:51:19.790
Did you have a nice nap?

00:51:19.795 --> 00:51:22.560
- Penance, you're in danger.
- Well, I know, hence the unstrapping.

00:51:22.565 --> 00:51:24.860
- Get out of here now.
- I'm not leaving you. Not again.

00:51:24.865 --> 00:51:27.870
I'm sorry I didn't give you
a proper break, Ms. Adair!

00:51:27.875 --> 00:51:31.175
But now that you've had it,
back on the job!

00:51:36.015 --> 00:51:38.010
No!

00:51:38.015 --> 00:51:41.150
Finish what you started,
and I'll call them off.

00:52:03.775 --> 00:52:05.235
What are you doing?!

00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:44.380
Mother.

00:53:12.345 --> 00:53:14.210
Ah!

00:53:14.215 --> 00:53:15.845
It's time.

00:53:29.425 --> 00:53:30.425
Ah!

00:53:43.435 --> 00:53:45.200
Amalia! Into the light!

00:53:47.615 --> 00:53:49.215
Oh!

00:53:54.655 --> 00:53:55.880
Mother!

00:53:55.885 --> 00:53:57.720
That is not your mother!

00:54:31.485 --> 00:54:33.625
- Ms. Adair.
- Mrs. True.

00:54:34.725 --> 00:54:36.520
You look very fine.

00:54:36.525 --> 00:54:39.065
I think so, too.

00:54:40.595 --> 00:54:42.260
What's wrong?

00:54:42.265 --> 00:54:44.000
Door!

00:54:46.105 --> 00:54:48.005
Gentlemen!

00:54:50.975 --> 00:54:53.670
Virtue should not cower before evil.

00:54:53.675 --> 00:54:56.710
It should look it straight in the eye
and take careful aim.
