00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.785
- I won't be long.
- Come, Lavinia!

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.260
Faster! Faster!

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.825
Slow down! Slow down.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.735
I wish you weren't moving to Paris.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.365
I know, my love, but you have
important duties to uphold here.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.175
You'll be young Master Bidlow
in my absence.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.275
- The last Bidlow, more like.
- Oh, darling, please don't be morose.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.145
- Not right before I leave.
- But, Lavinia,

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.775
you're bound to get married now.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.445
And once you are,
it'll just be me. Won't it?

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.115
Are you going to show me
this marvelous thing

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.690
that you've made or not?

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.630
Come on!

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.195
They're passerines. Mostly corvids.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.766
But I was lucky to find one specimen

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.770
with its alternate plumage intact.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.236
Do you see how the contour feathers

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.870
grow downwards in order to...

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.510
Vinnie?

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.150
Is something the matter?

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.520
How did you come by all of these?

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.655
I...

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.555
I didn't hurt them, Vinnie!

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.625
I found them, and I simply...

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.800
Have I done something wrong?

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.385
Help me!

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.785
Help!

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.155
Help!

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.625
Is there anybody there?

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.435
Help!

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.165
Help!

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.270
Augie!

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.645
Lavinia.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.015
Oh! Help me, my darling.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.120
Just stay... stay still. Stay still.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.560
Uh...

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.435
Alright. We're gonna lift you, alright?

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.735
That's it. Legs.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.635
That's it. You're alright.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.305
You're alright.

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.820
Um... I'm gonna get your chair.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.840
Penance!

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.245
- Penance!
- I'm alright, but I have to go

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.780
gentle now or the whole thing
will fall down on us. Oh...

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.030
Well, here goes a little bit of nothing.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.340
It needed me, Pen, and I... Fuck!

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:09.980
Penance, it came this way!

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.505
Lord Massen. You need to go down.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:35.805
Something's changed.

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.945
The knocking, sir, it won't stop.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.975
Maybe she was frightened
by the earthquake.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:40.980
Enough!

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.690
Lord Massen! Please!

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.840
Your mother was spirited, too.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.045
It's a pity... you never knew her.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.320
But at least she was... spared this.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.055
If I were to let you leave...

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.530
I know what fearful men are capable of.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.470
A lone aberration like you...

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.300
could never survive outside these walls.

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.205
Lillie.

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:18.405
I...

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:51.945
Ruby!

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:53.550
I need some more cocaine!

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.945
What in the name of
all-holy fuck practice

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:58.715
have you people been doing all day?

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.785
Ruby!

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:02.955
My lord.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.085
Why am I looking at a broken
lavatory of a hallway?

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:06.795
Is nothing prepared?

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.055
Where's my Olympian splendor?

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.125
My gilded tendrils of light?

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:12.626
- There is a concern...
- There is not.

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:13.695
that we won't be ready...

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:14.936
- You will be.
- ... by tonight.

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.865
The night of the party? Excellent.

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:19.875
There's been an earthquake, Lord Swann.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.775
Moses lived through 10 plagues! Ten!

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:23.975
And a stutter!

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.815
But still, he got to work!

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.575
He parted the Red fucking Sea
with nothing

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.245
but a robe and a stick.

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:33.185
You people have powers, abilities!

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:35.015
Use them!

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:38.495
Isn't there any one of you who
can just float that into place?

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:39.995
And you, plastering person!

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.590
You intend for the ferrymen
to collapse into the river?

00:08:42.595 --> 00:08:45.495
At least put some plaster on the
more ghastly cracks down there.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.135
It doesn't have to be real.
It just needs to look pretty.

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:50.105
Surely, you can understand that.

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:53.075
Well, the quake, sir.
The foundations are damaged.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.635
That is the entire point!

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.275
This is a sybaritic festival!

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:00.875
Tonight, there will be no foundation!

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.975
Destiny cannot wait!

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:15.530
Much more of that.

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:19.065
They telephoned again.

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:21.765
This morning. Twice yesterday.

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:24.365
It's your father. He's
asking for you, sir.

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:25.905
And in five minutes, he'll be asking

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:29.635
for his dear departed
cocker spaniel Ruediger.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.945
Beat the crap out of that
poor creature as well.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.780
But he's dying, sir.

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:38.745
Are you still here?

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.325
Look, I'll go, alright?

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.355
- Tomorrow.
- But they say tomorrow will be too...

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.225
Tomorrow, we can all return
to our miserable realities!

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:52.395
But tonight, please help me
forget all about it.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.235
Gods will be men.
Men will be gods, Ruby.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.240
And each will be transformed
by a taste of the other's lives.

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.180
Destiny cannot wait.

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:24.060
Oh, fuck!

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.705
Who is it?

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:35.280
It's me.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.250
Don't have many visitors then?

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.960
- Is that everything?
- Just about.

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:03.635
I saw you, you know.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.140
In the cell with her.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.205
Just before she broke out.

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:12.405
- New Super's sharper than he looks.
- New Super is a prick.

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:14.315
He's gunning for you.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.520
Talking about dismissal
unless you show your face.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.785
I don't understand.

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:24.190
You're just gonna throw away
a whole career for what?

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:39.610
You mustn't carry that
around with you, Frank.

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:44.140
- You know about Lord Massen?
- Massen?

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.016
One of them ministers
without portfolio, ain't he?

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:49.315
Whispering in everyone's ear.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.485
I need a way in.

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:54.315
Who's he friends with? Who's he fucking?

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.985
Do you think I've got the faintest idea

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:59.255
what side of the bed someone
like Lord Massen sleeps on?

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.855
Oh, yeah. Sorry. That's right.
He comes down to Nag's

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:05.060
every Thursday for a pint, don't he?

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:12.335
No. You serious?

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:15.205
He had Mary killed? Why would
he do something like that?

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:18.275
- I don't know. I'm gonna find out.
- No, you ain't.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.350
You'll get nothing but dead ends.

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:24.145
It's a fixed fuckin' order!
You know that!

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:25.785
One way or another,

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:29.360
I will see him stretch for what he done.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:33.960
I owe her that at least.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.290
What the hell?

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:05.220
Lucy?

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:21.810
You...

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:26.275
too late... for all that.

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.485
What are you doin' down here?

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:34.090
You still think you know everything.

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:46.200
I hated myself... for so long.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.870
I see it in you, too.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:56.280
Who brought you down here, Lucy?

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:00.115
Lucy. Don't.

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:13.360
It... It sang to me, True.

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:18.430
Gentler than Mary, even.

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.665
Can you imagine...

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:26.165
singing... with such...

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:27.540
glory...

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:31.975
echoing through every...

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:35.350
hard and angry part of me?

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:40.450
Right through all of the...

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:45.320
goddamned loneliness.

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:24.265
I don't understand.

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:27.265
She was down here with the Galanthi.

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:29.265
I think she broke it out.

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:30.770
Did she hurt it?

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.850
Penance, you'll want that, I think.

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:50.455
Time to go.

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:53.460
- Well, we have to bury her.
- She won't hold it against us.

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:55.755
I might!

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:57.665
Someone told Lucy about the Galanthi

00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:59.395
because they wanted her to destroy it.

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.265
- Who? Hague?
- I don't know,

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:03.340
but I have to find it
before it's too late.

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.320
Where to then?

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:28.330
No way out but through.

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.710
- It's not much further.
- What is?

00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:01.930
We can take it all the way out.

00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:22.680
Is this... for the Galanthi?

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:28.450
What is a... "galanthi"?

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:34.690
Someone I know, s-someone...

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:37.460
I trust...

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:41.500
they told me that maybe...

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:48.170
- maybe it was hope.
- Hope?

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:53.675
I expected better of
a scientist like Ms. Adair.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.146
It wasn't Ms. Adair. It was Mrs. True.

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:56.775
Pining after two Touched women?

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:58.245
I hope this isn't becoming a fetish.

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:00.315
Am I not allowed friendship
under your purview,

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:01.755
Lavinia? For God's sake.

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.625
Be it Hugo or Ms. Adair or...

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:06.430
anyone who fails to live up

00:18:06.435 --> 00:18:08.675
to your draconian expectation...

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.905
We almost died, Vinnie.

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:24.575
Don't you think we could
take this moment,

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:28.210
th-this opportunity to just
be honest with one another?

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.645
I-I saw you w-with the...

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:34.085
with the Touched woman. I-I...

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:35.585
I saw what you did.

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:38.785
I just need you to tell me why.

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:42.155
Regardless of what you
have been told by Mrs. True,

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.625
that creature is our enemy.

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:50.240
But, y-y-you... you support the Touched!

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:04.615
Well, then...

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:06.116
I refuse to take one more step with you

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:09.255
if you... if you... don't tell me
what is going on down here

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.785
w-with this enemy!

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:15.225
Augustus, how did you know I was here?

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:21.635
Well, I mean... As-as-as diffi...

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:25.235
As difficult to hear... um, I was...

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.435
I thought we were being
honest with each other.

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:30.875
Now get out of my way.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:33.850
- Lavinia...
- Get out of my way!

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:36.175
You'll hurt yourself! Lavinia!

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:38.515
Shit. You alright? Um...

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:41.855
S-stay there. Stay there.
Stay there. Uh...

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:45.755
Move your arm.
It's alright. It's alright.

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:48.425
Come on. Come on.

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:52.725
Careful with your head.

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:07.015
Désirée is here because
it's time we had it out.

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.080
Any objections, you can go.

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:16.415
Good. Now, tell us again

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:18.555
exactly what that Bidlow
woman said to Amalia.

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.295
"No one in or out until
this unrest is settled,

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:23.395
or I'll be forced to
withdraw my patronage".

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.766
Which says to me Ms. Bidlow's guards

00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:27.570
aren't here to protect us.
They're here to protect her.

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:29.895
How do you mean?

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:32.365
Her investment, her reputation.

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:34.175
So, Amalia laying out Bidlow's guards

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:35.705
like a couple of flapjacks

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:37.845
is probably bad for us.

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:39.575
Definitely not good.

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:42.620
Where will we go if
we lose the orphanage?

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.186
Well, it seems to me
that she's left you all

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:47.485
at your most vulnerable hour.

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:49.885
It wasn't Amalia who
burned our house down.

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:53.425
She's got her mission,

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:56.295
but the Purists are our real enemy.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.395
Any moment now, they will be
swarming these doors and...

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.735
- we're not ready.
- They're growing in numbers.

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:04.135
Aneel told me.

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:07.705
He says everyone out there
blames us for the earthquakes.

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:09.505
They say that Maladie called down

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:12.305
some dark Touched magic when she hung.

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:14.445
Well, they're right.

00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:18.515
Mrs. True's creature
is responsible, isn't it?

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:21.955
All it seems to be doing
is causing chaos.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.955
Had enough eyes on me as it was.

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:25.855
Well, Amalia told us the Galanthi

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:27.455
is from her future,

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:28.995
so she can deal with it.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.495
What's coming for us is bigger
than some angry mob.

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.665
Soon, the Purists won't just be
the men on the streets,

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:36.296
but they'll be the men
in the police stations

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:38.065
and the men in the courtrooms!

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:40.735
Fear of the Touched will become
just part of the system.

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:43.335
There weren't no system for me
and Nigey when we needed it.

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:45.475
Yeah, and that's why
we need to change things.

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:48.945
How we gonna change anything
when we're stuck inside here?

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:51.485
- We need to wait for Amalia...
- Oh no, we are done

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:54.015
waiting for Amalia to save us.

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:55.860
It's time to do things our own way.

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:04.095
And what do we benefit?

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:06.795
Becoming foot soldiers
in this army of yours?

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.495
Guns. More nicker than you can find

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:11.805
in the pages of your good book,
for a start.

00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:14.875
I know. I know about your principles.

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:18.375
It's okay. Singing your
little songs on the street,

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:21.675
daubing your little picture
on the walls.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.545
Now if your idea of a campaign
is a few kids with crayons...

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:26.615
We've given lives in battle.

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:28.855
She means her friend,
the girl that got killed.

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:30.860
She don't mean no harm. Do you, Bess?

00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:34.655
Ever heard of King Canute?

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:36.755
Learned about him at the schoolhouse.

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:38.825
Stupid old duffer.

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:42.035
Sat there shoutin' at the sea
till it drowned him.

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.805
Oi. She yours?

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:48.135
- Get back, Bess.
- And there's you.

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:50.945
Asking for our lives
while you walk around

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:53.505
with the stink of your
Touched pet on you.

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:54.980
A foul musk.

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.015
You ought to be ashamed.

00:22:58.020 --> 00:22:59.785
Should I?

00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:02.290
- She's only a kid.
- I ain't afraid.

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:36.815
If anyone,

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:39.185
man, woman, or girl,

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:43.095
have any doubts about
where my loyalties lie,

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:44.695
step forward.

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:50.700
Yeah, what I thought.

00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:53.765
I'll get my army

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:56.410
and you get your money and your guns.

00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:01.710
Never was a fairer match made
in all of London town.

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:05.615
And you. Just a little tadpole,

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:07.890
but your mouth got some bite.

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:17.730
You oughta watch your backs
with that one, boys.

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:33.780
Why must you always be this way?

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.845
It's...

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:39.545
My whole life, I've just
tried to please you.

00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:41.255
I've just... just...

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:43.215
I've done everything as you've asked.

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:45.120
W-why you keep me at a distance?

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:49.025
Because you can't help me.

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:51.225
Y-you let somebody help you!

00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:52.965
Why couldn't it have been me?

00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:54.795
Am I so lacking in your...

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:57.565
You are not fit to carry
the Bidlow name!

00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:05.780
I did it all for you, Augie.
Can't you see?

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.710
The...

00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:12.185
Galanthi,

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:14.250
what it did to us.

00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:20.490
Hurt you, Augie.

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:24.565
I can't help but...

00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:26.800
hate it for what it did to you.

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:41.810
You know.

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.390
I know every hair on your head.

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:51.890
I know every shadow in your eye.

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:57.525
I taste the very air
before you breathe it.

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:09.610
Long before there was a word for it...

00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:14.005
I knew you were Touched.

00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:22.785
I watched when you tried

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:26.225
to play it for confused bumbling.

00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:29.930
Many people were
fooled by it, but not me.

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:32.770
S... I-I was...

00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:36.365
I was never trying to fool you.

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:37.935
When the reports of the Touched

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:40.010
had become too numerous to ignore,

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.880
I knew y-you had some part in it.

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:49.515
Can you imagine, Augie,
how that pained me?

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.990
That I knew my brother, my everything,

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:55.715
was a danger?

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:58.226
What, you think... You think
because I'm Touched,

00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:00.085
I'm somewhat... What...

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:02.655
What, I'm a... I'm a...
I'm a danger to society?

00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:04.055
No!

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:11.065
The creature didn't make you dangerous.

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:14.610
It simply amplified
what you already were.

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:23.720
I see.

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:36.060
I'm going to try and start the boiler.

00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:01.520
Excuse me. You can't go in there! Sir!

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:06.925
Frank?

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:10.965
What an entirely unexpected surprise.

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:13.065
No riverbank summons today, then?

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:15.900
Or perhaps you're here to
see the Ferryman himself.

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:20.065
What the fuck are you doin'?

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:21.610
Preparing.

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:25.680
What is that?

00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:28.345
Is that milk?

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:29.915
Yes, well,

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:31.615
I wouldn't expect you to understand

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:33.985
the rigors of performance.

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:35.890
Or art, for that matter.

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:45.730
Lord Massen.

00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:49.000
He one of yours?

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:54.370
Be coming to your little
shindig tonight?

00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:59.305
- No.
- Because your families,

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:02.475
they go way back, don't they?

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:05.445
Ain't you gone peacock
shooting together,

00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:08.450
or ridin' around on stags?

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:12.160
You got the wrong Swann, Frank.

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:18.030
Don't look at me.

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:21.830
Is everything alright?

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:37.150
No, I ain't come here for that.

00:29:40.390 --> 00:29:42.255
No.

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:44.060
No, of course not.

00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:49.660
Well, uh, I can't give you Massen.

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:57.095
Closing ranks, eh?

00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:00.470
- That's what all you lot do sooner or later.
- Get out.

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:04.605
The fixed fuckin' order.

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:11.350
God forbid you should ever
just come to see me, Frank.

00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:45.310
You've had a telegram.

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:55.690
Made her favorite.
Always calms her down.

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:05.160
We must put an end to this madness now.

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:09.495
But, sir...

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:11.035
We can't.

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:12.540
End it.

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:24.315
Feels wrong to have
left her there all alone.

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:27.020
I told you before, you have
to focus on something else.

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:30.390
Don't give in to it.

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:33.455
What?

00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:37.455
Sentiment. A good soldier
never looks back.

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:40.425
She must have been desperate
to have tried to kill the Galanthi.

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:42.165
Why would it let her break it out?

00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:44.465
Can't say I've given much thought to...

00:32:50.610 --> 00:32:52.205
Play with me.

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:56.475
Play with me!

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:05.025
Bet the road rose up
to meet you on that one.

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:06.925
Nothing makes any...

00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:08.425
goddamned gray one...

00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:10.325
He's going to help.

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:12.225
Shut up and ship out.

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:14.195
A friend's the one you trust.

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.970
Fucking sim!

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:28.450
I just want it to be over.

00:33:31.390 --> 00:33:33.845
There's mercy aplenty for
every sin under God's sun,

00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:35.755
save the blasphemy of giving up.

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:38.420
Please don't be dancin'
with the devil of despair.

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:43.090
Well, maybe the devil
shouldn't have fuckin' asked.

00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:50.095
Come on, that's it!

00:33:51.610 --> 00:33:53.005
Go again!

00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:59.645
Faster, alright?

00:33:59.650 --> 00:34:01.745
Faster...

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:08.685
Good. Good.

00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:09.950
Good...

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:18.725
You're training 'em how to fight?

00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:21.800
Put some of these turns to use.
Show them what we're capable of.

00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:25.865
The people out there
already fear us, Annie.

00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:28.805
- Good.
- No, not good.

00:34:28.810 --> 00:34:30.905
This kind of display is only gonna drive

00:34:30.910 --> 00:34:32.305
more of the people to the Purists.

00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:33.645
So what, we just lock our doors

00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:35.350
and pray that no one burns us down?

00:34:36.450 --> 00:34:38.515
You said it yourself, Horatio.

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:40.315
Our world is on fire.

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:43.060
Why won't you stand up and
use what you've been given?

00:35:00.609 --> 00:35:02.375
Quick sharp, little man, it's out!

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:04.575
It's out, and we must oblige it.

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:06.745
Our Sunday best, eh?

00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:10.445
Oh, what's a bit of lace to do
with bags of flesh and bone?

00:35:10.450 --> 00:35:12.185
Eh? Still,

00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:14.445
we want to look our best, don't we?

00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:17.555
I've been waiting so
patiently all this time.

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:19.855
What are we doing?

00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:22.195
What are we doing?!

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:24.025
What am I digging for?

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:26.095
Why has the rat stopped scrabbling?

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:27.570
Make haste! Make haste!

00:35:28.570 --> 00:35:30.465
As it happens...

00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:32.205
a pack of rabid dogs

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:35.235
has caught your nasty scent!

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:37.105
There lies your only chance!

00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:38.505
Dig, dig, dig!

00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:40.805
It's coming.

00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:42.715
It's coming! Hey, it's there. It's...

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:47.090
Oh, it stings, Angel!

00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:48.685
It's stuck!

00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:50.415
Oh...

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:52.425
It's almost... It's clawing.

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:54.755
Scraping...

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:56.895
Sound familiar?

00:35:58.670 --> 00:36:00.195
Listen to it.

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:02.135
Chicken-hearted thing.

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:05.465
Screamin' and twistin'. Such suffering.

00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:08.375
No. I hear nothing. Nothing. Noth...

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:10.575
And you call yourself a man of science?

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:13.345
A creator, eh?

00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:16.245
Oh, it's only been two days, love.

00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:17.675
According to my calculations,

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.785
we've got at least 670 to go

00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:20.885
before I let you sleep.

00:36:20.890 --> 00:36:23.415
This accumulation of anguish is dear,

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:24.955
very dear to me.

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:27.690
I will defend it until I won't.
Until I don't.

00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:43.310
- Are you finished yet?
- Near enough.

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:48.645
Have you used kindling?

00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:52.285
- What... What kindling?
- Heaven's sake!

00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:56.355
Augie, it is the basic principle
of operating a st...

00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:58.156
What the hell do you know
about the basic principle

00:36:58.160 --> 00:36:59.760
of the operation of a steam engine?

00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:02.160
Do you know, Lavinia?

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:07.065
I-I think it's high time
you started answering

00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:08.695
some of my questions for a change.

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:10.265
A-about the bodies.

00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:12.305
- What bodies?
- The b... The bodies. The ones...

00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:14.205
The ones in the cave. The... God,

00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:16.405
they had such horrible scars.

00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:18.745
- God knows what you've done to them.
- Augustus...

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:20.705
No, no, no, no, no!

00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:24.180
Lavinia, I will, I will finish my
thought, thank you very much.

00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:27.650
Look, it just...

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:30.925
It-it seems to me that...

00:37:31.930 --> 00:37:34.260
you're the one that we
should be worried about.

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:37.595
M-maybe...

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:39.765
I'm the one...

00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:41.830
who should be taking responsibility

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:44.470
for you!

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:47.740
You're acting strangely, Augie.

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:51.075
But, s-strange can...

00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:53.445
can be wondrous!

00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:57.175
It can be beautiful. It's glorious.

00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:59.615
Of course, you don't know
anything about that.

00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:01.915
Everything I have done

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:04.385
has been done in the name of humanity.

00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:05.755
Sorry...

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:07.555
D-do you alone get to dictate

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:09.425
who's included in this
version of humanity?

00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:10.825
'Cause based on what I saw today,

00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:13.395
you've done far more to
compromise the Bidlow name

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:15.435
than I ever have!

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:18.800
You were shouting,
"Kill it. Kill it, kill it!" I...

00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:21.835
I...

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:25.205
Never in my life have I done
anything to hurt anyone.

00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:27.770
- Anybody!
- Are you serious?

00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:32.380
But that was an accident.

00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:35.175
An accident?

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:37.375
Mm-hmm.

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:39.045
Is that what you truly believe?

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:40.285
I was a child!

00:38:40.290 --> 00:38:41.885
You pushed me!

00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:50.755
- No. No. Mm-mmm.
- You did.

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:55.165
And then, you watched me fall!

00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:59.035
And now, you still refuse to
acknowledge your culpability.

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:00.765
And you can't see what...

00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:25.160
I think, Lavinia...

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:30.665
you fail to give yourself
the credit that you deserve.

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:37.805
You shape your own life.

00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:42.880
It... it's time I shape mine.

00:39:50.090 --> 00:39:51.955
Augustus!

00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:57.860
I've had enough of your theatrics! Stop!

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:02.300
Augustus!

00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:20.180
That's enough.

00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:52.450
That'll have to do, old chap.

00:40:58.190 --> 00:41:01.760
Ruby, If you say one more thing
about my goddamn father...

00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:10.635
I'm afraid it's too
late, sir. He's gone.

00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:22.250
What shall I tell them?

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:32.255
Let us call down the gods, Ruby.

00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:34.790
Lord Swann... I mean, Your Grace.

00:41:51.010 --> 00:41:53.405
Welcome one,

00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:56.115
welcome all.

00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:58.845
Tonight, I am but your humble

00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:01.185
and lowly steward,

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:03.485
conducting you from the shores of...

00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:06.755
inert, quotidian languor

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:09.425
to one better suited

00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:11.455
to the divine.

00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:13.395
Welcome to Mount Olympus.

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:16.495
Your Saturnalia awaits.

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:19.270
Hail, Saturnalia!

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:41.025
Ah...

00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:43.395
Each strike, closer to God.

00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:49.065
Don't fret, pet. Promise a big
wet kiss when I'm back.

00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:51.935
Keep him warm while I'm gone, will ya?

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:05.050
We've been walkin' for hours.

00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:10.515
Maybe we should head home, have
a look through the spectralacle

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:12.520
and try and track the Galanthi that way.

00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:17.095
Home? The orphanage is
a stopgap, not a home.

00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:18.195
No, Amalia.

00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:20.011
That might have been true
when we first started,

00:43:20.015 --> 00:43:21.245
but it's not the case now.

00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:23.450
Didn't Mary's song show you that
beyond a whisper of a doubt?

00:43:23.455 --> 00:43:25.955
And now, Mary's dead. And Lucy's dead.

00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:30.005
My God, don't you know better
than to get attached?

00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:31.405
I've lived in countless homes,

00:43:31.410 --> 00:43:33.445
and I lost every single one of them.

00:43:34.350 --> 00:43:36.615
Can barely remember the one
I grew up in, let alone...

00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:39.280
What in God's Heaven...

00:43:50.430 --> 00:43:53.195
Oh, you.

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:54.695
The two-faced woman

00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:57.465
and her pretty little finger poppet.

00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:03.975
- Are you real?
- Are you real?

00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:06.040
Are you here? 'Cause I am.

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:21.425
Always turning up
where you're not wanted.

00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:23.230
You're alive?

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:28.635
Heard you tried to save
my neck from stretchin'.

00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:30.735
Did you imagine we'd be friends?

00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:33.870
Brush each other's hair in the mornings?

00:44:35.410 --> 00:44:37.275
A hundred times, mine.

00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:38.975
Nice and shiny.

00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:40.945
Bet she tried to stop you, didn't she?

00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:43.615
Bet she tried to tell you Maladie
deserved to go limp like a dolly,

00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:45.015
but she doesn't learn, you see?

00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:46.815
Doesn't listen. She can't hear.

00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:49.620
Her head's empty. Empty.

00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:52.020
Empty.

00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:55.125
What do you want to teach me?

00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:57.190
You don't know what I fuckin' want.

00:44:58.260 --> 00:44:59.925
What would I want with her, eh?

00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:01.695
She's a lost one, isn't she?

00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:03.165
She can't even hear it.

00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:04.365
Hear what?

00:45:06.610 --> 00:45:09.935
We were talking. Never could
abide rudeness. You?

00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:12.845
Th-there's a time and a place.

00:45:12.850 --> 00:45:15.445
Exactly. This is the time, the place

00:45:15.450 --> 00:45:19.015
for what I should have done
the first time he mocked me.

00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:20.885
With that know-nothing nightingale Mary.

00:45:20.890 --> 00:45:23.685
Got to thinkin', maybe
I'm faulting the angels

00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:24.855
for the sin of their maker,

00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:27.655
when he's the one should
go first, don't you think?

00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:29.665
Isn't that fairest of all?

00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:32.195
K-k-kill th-their maker?

00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:34.495
Such a lot of hummin'
for such a little craven.

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:35.605
It's been years and years.

00:45:35.610 --> 00:45:37.105
I can't wait to get out.

00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:38.875
But he makes hum.

00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:42.710
You can hear the Galanthi.

00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:45.845
You know where it is, don't you?

00:45:45.850 --> 00:45:47.915
You've always known.

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:50.920
Think you're so clever,
but I know you aren't.

00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:56.785
Take a good look at that face, girlie.

00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:58.785
You won't be seeing it much longer.

00:45:58.790 --> 00:46:02.030
- Not after she's gone and left you.
- Gone?

00:46:05.770 --> 00:46:07.795
My heart pangs, too.

00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:10.805
My heart and my lungs and my
cunt and my guts and my brain.

00:46:10.810 --> 00:46:12.505
All of them are thrum-a-drum.

00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:15.435
Bang, bang, loud and soft,
and loud again, enough!

00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:20.645
Who you gonna choose, eh?

00:46:20.650 --> 00:46:22.250
Who you gonna choose?

00:46:24.090 --> 00:46:27.360
I've made my choice. La.

00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:35.996
- What does she mean "gone", Amalia?
- Penance, please.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.665
- We have to go now.
- So you save the Galanthi.

00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:41.795
Won't it want to take you home?
Where is that?

00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:43.040
When is that?

00:46:44.310 --> 00:46:45.870
And you'll go, won't you?

00:46:48.910 --> 00:46:50.240
Of course, you will.

00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:52.810
You must.

00:46:57.420 --> 00:46:58.550
What are you doing?

00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:01.585
No, we stay together.

00:47:01.590 --> 00:47:03.455
I'm no soldier.
I'll only get in the way.

00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:04.460
Penance, please!

00:47:05.730 --> 00:47:07.290
The Galanthi needs you.

00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:09.660
The world needs you.

00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:31.490
It's very... very hot.

00:47:36.690 --> 00:47:38.286
As it happens...

00:47:38.290 --> 00:47:40.725
your fever's only getting worse.

00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:45.025
My lady said to keep you warm,

00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:46.595
so warm I'll be keeping you warm.

00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:51.235
She's got special plans for you.

00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:55.175
Gone to make a mockery
of their disrespect.

00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:56.875
Should aim for the heart of it.

00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:17.195
From little girls to powerful lords...

00:48:20.270 --> 00:48:22.635
... of us all!

00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:27.505
Is they maladies?

00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:29.745
♪ Maladie! ♪

00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:31.975
♪ And make Maladies of... ♪

00:50:24.030 --> 00:50:25.325
You really don't learn.

00:50:39.810 --> 00:50:42.840
Sure you don't wanna
play with me? Eh? No?

00:50:48.050 --> 00:50:51.785
How about we make a wager?

00:50:51.790 --> 00:50:53.655
I'm not doing this.

00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:54.885
Do you think

00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:57.425
God will beg at my feet for mercy,

00:50:57.430 --> 00:51:00.330
or meet the end with his head held high?

00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:06.100
- Ah!
- I'll even give you a head start.

00:51:12.610 --> 00:51:15.035
I'm not going to hurt you.

00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:17.375
Far too late for that.

00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:34.555
Should we call Penance?
See what she's up to?

00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:37.525
That one understands
the meaning of friendship.

00:51:37.530 --> 00:51:39.000
Sort of wish we met sooner.

00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:44.740
Do you think she misses us? Eh?

00:54:15.325 --> 00:54:22.825
