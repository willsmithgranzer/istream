00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.685
I know what I need.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.555
Same thing as you.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.485
You have no idea what I want.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.195
I love her!

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.180
Fuck.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.220
Isaiah.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.555
Isaiah!

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.530
Isaiah?

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.466
Isaiah, I've been
lookin' all over for you.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.335
You're supposed to be in bed, hm?

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.380
- Are you angry?
- Am I a... No, I'm...

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.950
Not with you.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.590
Got yourself a little cubbyhole, eh?

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.555
I like that.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.660
Can I see?

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.270
Still thinking about the other night?

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.270
Me, too.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.135
I know.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.805
You try not to think about it,

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.880
so you dream it instead.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.490
I didn't mean to look,
but I can't help it.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.425
You're...

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.700
- You're looking at my dreams.
- Not just yours.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.610
H-h-h...

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.045
How do you see these things?

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.805
Mom says I'm Touched.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.145
She says what now?

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.720
Like you, only different.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.390
But she told me not to tell.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.400
What is that?

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.365
Isaiah, what is that?

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:37.870
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.520
Isaiah, whose dreams are these?

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.390
Isaiah!

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.230
Who is this?

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.970
The man who's coming for us.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.200
The puppet man.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:36.950
Care to explain?

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.655
Listen, it's no secret that I take issue

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.365
with most of Mrs. True's ways,

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.670
especially her habit
of just disappearing.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.335
But dealing with it like this,

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.865
well, it's just fucking stupid.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.840
- What kind of idiot...
- Careful.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.540
What I mean is...

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.145
anger doesn't make you special.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.315
Anger's like...

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.075
- Well, it's like noses.
- Noses?

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.185
- Shut up.
- Hey, not inside.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.816
- House rules, remember?
- It's everywhere.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.855
On every face.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.285
What makes you special
is what you do with it.

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:16.985
The anger.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.855
How you channel it.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.725
And that, I can show you.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.865
How to let your anger out,
and in far better ways

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.940
than ripping up Amalia's old dresses.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.465
What do you say?

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.275
Sounded like "fuck off" to me.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.290
What if she's dead?

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:48.990
What if she's dead?

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.730
She could be dead. She could
be dead. She could be dead!

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:59.840
Or worse.

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.140
She could still be alive.

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.875
What if she's still alive?

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.645
- Sir!
- Huh? W-what? What?

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.716
Cook wants to know if today's
engagement is still happening.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.815
Engagement?

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.915
The luncheon, sir.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.015
In aid of the orphanage?

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.820
And since Ms. Bidlow's not back...

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:23.690
Huh.

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:13.995
- How long have you known?
- What are you talking about?

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.670
What am I talking about?

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:18.770
Our son is drawing things.

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:22.545
Violent, terrifying things.

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:25.980
Things that no child should
ever... And you knew.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.745
Katherine, you knew,
and you kept it from me.

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:32.215
I'm his father!

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.825
I know who you are.

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:36.655
I know you better than you can imagine.

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:38.195
All thanks to Isaiah.

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.125
You think I wanted to bear this alone?

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:43.025
Our son's "gift".

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:45.035
Him waking in the night
because of your dreams!

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.465
- Because of the violence in your head!
- Not only mine!

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:49.735
Him asking me why his daddy
is dreaming of monsters!

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.705
Of bad men!

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:54.280
Other things a child can't understand.

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.045
He saw it all, Horatio.

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:00.985
If you dreamed it, he saw it.

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:03.650
- You should have said.
- When?

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.790
You're distant, distracted.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.025
Why did you bring us here?

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:14.025
I wanted to keep you and Isaiah safe.

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:15.600
Safe?

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:18.700
What's even is that?

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:22.400
Our son is hurting.

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:26.010
He is scared, and he is haunted.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.905
Just like his father.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:30.675
You want to make us safe?

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.745
Stop these dreams. I don't care how.

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:36.820
Just prioritize your family
for once, Horatio.

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:49.295
I'm sure you'll be delighted to hear

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:51.970
that my party was a disaster.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.175
You could offer me
a cup of tea at least.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:04.945
I'm off out.

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:07.150
Hunting stag?

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:11.220
Sorry. I didn't mean to...

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.925
I want to help with Massen.

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:23.165
- You what?
- That's what you wanted, isn't it?

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:25.230
My help with your, uh...

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:28.965
Your case, your mission.

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:31.910
Well you can't bloody well storm
the House of Lords, can you?

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:35.010
You'll never get close
to him without me.

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:38.645
I'm not one of them, Frank.

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:40.720
That was my father's world.

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:45.655
- But it will not be mine.
- That ain't a decision

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.420
you just get to make, is it?

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.125
Not out there.

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:52.725
It ain't about who you wanna be.

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:54.730
You know you sound like a man defeated.

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:57.525
The definition of a realist.

00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:00.700
Fine. I'm a toff. I always will be.

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:03.075
I still want to help.

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.835
What's good old Lord Massen done anyway?

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.275
Diddle the chambermaid?

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.175
Wait. Have...

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.680
Have I got it right? Is that it?

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.485
He killed Mary.

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.445
Hello? Who's in there?

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:25.850
Oh, my God.

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:30.425
Sarah.

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.800
Praise God.

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:43.870
They kept you from me. All this time.

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.880
Well, you're home now.

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:51.410
You're really home.

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:02.960
I'm home.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.840
Come on.

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:17.835
She can't have left with it yet.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.240
They have to be somewhere.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.785
Maybe I should've...

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:08.860
No. I did the right thing.

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:12.795
Ms. Adair?

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.566
I'm so sorry. It's just no one
seems to know where you were.

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:17.225
They said you'd gone with Mrs. True.

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:18.835
How'd you get through the guards?

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.865
Oh, um, well, I-I dismissed them.

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:24.065
- You just told them to go?
- Yeah.

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:26.775
Turns out, there are
two Bidlows after all.

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:30.805
Uh, I hope I'm not interrupting.

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:33.145
Oh... No.

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:36.845
Um, to what do I owe this visit?

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:38.755
Well, uh...

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:42.255
Actually, I-I'm in
need of a favor. Um...

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:45.425
Lavinia has left me in charge
of the orphanage fundraiser

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:47.430
this afternoon, and, um...

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:49.825
Um, it...

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:52.065
It's just a little overwhelming,

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:55.665
with th-th-the food, and
the wine, and the seating,

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:58.275
the speech... Honestly,

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:01.305
I... I got no idea what I'm doing.

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:03.545
Um, would you come?

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:04.845
Me?

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:07.145
Yes. Yeah, I just...

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:09.086
I'd feel so much better
if you were there with me.

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:11.515
I might actually have a shot
at pulling this off.

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.185
Uh...

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:17.825
- Luncheons aren't really my thing.
- Nor mine.

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:21.100
Thought, um... Thought we could
be out of place together.

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:26.865
I just... I thought it would be nice

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:29.435
to spend a whole day with you.

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:32.710
In full view of society.
Because the thing is, Ms. Adair,

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:38.575
I-I don't want t-to try
and kiss you anymore.

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:40.715
- You don't?
- No, I don't. I don't.

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:43.220
I-I just... I want to actually kiss you.

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:46.385
If-if that's alright with you.

00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:00.540
- May I?
- You may.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.035
- Nothing general about that.
- No, no, no.

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:40.910
So, will you come? I-I'll
be forever in your debt.

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:43.480
Can Mrs. true spare you?

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:48.520
Definitely.

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:16.405
Is everything alright?

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:19.315
Y-yeah... Yeah. Sorry.

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:08.425
Excuse me, sir. Are you Edmund?

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:10.900
- Yes.
- There's a telephone call for you.

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:17.635
- Hello?
- Edmund!

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:20.675
- Mother.
- Darling, finally!

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:24.045
Where have you been?
I've been trying to reach you.

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:25.715
Oh, Mother, it's been so awful.

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.315
Yes, darling, of course.

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.181
- First, they destroyed the house.
- Sweetheart...

00:18:29.185 --> 00:18:31.146
And then, they abducted me.
And I was tortured.

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:33.255
Dearest... Edmund!

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:35.455
Sweetheart, I am, of course,
deeply sympathetic

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:36.625
to your struggles,

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:38.725
and I want in due time
to hear all about them,

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:42.425
but right now, I have news.

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:44.670
- News?
- Yes, my love.

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:47.565
I found it.

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:49.770
You thought it was lost.

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.680
Mother has it safe.

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:58.545
Soon, we'll be together again.

00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:02.750
Now, all we need is one
last piece of the puzzle.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.885
It's a lovely day for a party.

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:10.155
So she chose to go
after it, and I'm worried.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.825
Of course, you're worried.
She's your friend.

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:16.725
I-I will say if anyone can
handle themselves in crisis,

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:17.935
it's Mrs. True.

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.365
Well, that's certainly what
she'd like you to believe.

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:24.205
Tell me, how can you be sure
that you've done the right thing

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:28.280
when that thing just feels awful?

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:31.645
Well, I think, um,

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:34.820
y-y-you try to do your best
as often as you can,

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:38.590
and, maybe sometimes,

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:41.290
people get a bit bruised.

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:43.320
Unfortunately.

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:47.100
And y-you wonder,

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.365
was that the best thing?

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:52.865
Am, am I any good at all?

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:02.475
You're being hard on yourself.

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.345
And, actually, th-th-th...

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:07.815
that's further evidence of how
good a person you actually are.

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:12.115
Ms. Adair,

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:15.525
I could never be the person
this Mrs. True is to you.

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:16.760
But, uh...

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:19.260
I'm here.

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:23.465
And unless you tell me otherwise,

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:25.365
I'm not going anywhere.

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:01.300
Myrtle?

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.245
No.

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:11.510
You can't. You can't go.

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:15.285
You belong here. Like me.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.700
You can't stay.

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:39.840
I don't think you'd get very
far with me by your side.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.640
I just can't get over you being here.

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:17.510
It's a full-on miracle.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.060
Well, these will have
to come out, won't they?

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:45.370
They turned London upside
down, these Touched.

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:53.075
I'm a fair man. Reasonable.

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.350
I can't abide anyone thinks
they're above the rest.

00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:58.855
Taking up resources and not giving back,

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:01.455
which, as far as I can tell,
is exactly what they're doing.

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:05.455
Careful you don't overcook it.

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:06.990
Right. Of course.

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:12.470
They had the right idea
with that Maladie woman.

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:15.305
Maladie?

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:17.305
Hang the lot, I say.

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:20.910
I'm sorry.

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.880
Oh, that's really...

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:28.920
I didn't mean to...

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:38.625
Shh, shh, shh. Alright?

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:40.700
Um, darling...

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:43.965
Accidents happen.

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:46.470
We'll clean it up, and
no one will be the wiser.

00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:55.475
Now...

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:57.650
Let's try that again, shall we?

00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:18.570
I've taught you what
I know about fighting.

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.735
But fighting's not enough.

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:24.035
These Purists have
their sights set on us.

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:27.675
- It's not enough to just throw... or punch.
- Good.

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:29.645
- We've gotta be ready.
- No...

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:33.615
We have to learn to watch
each other's backs.

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:36.785
And that goes for each
and every one of us.

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:40.455
And with Amalia not here,
we have to work together...

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:43.425
How can we work together
when we can't even be together?

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:45.525
Annie, none of this matters anymore.

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:46.830
What's got into you?

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:51.865
There is a bill going through
the House of Lords this evening.

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:53.565
It's standard reactionary nonsense

00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:54.995
veiled as keeping London safe.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.805
But there's an amendment pending,

00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:58.406
and Aneel said the vote
could swing either way.

00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:00.135
Wait, what?

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:03.780
It will make it against the law
for the Touched to gather.

00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:07.945
They're going to separate us.
Split us apart.

00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:10.950
So unless we find some useful
precedent or a loophole,

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:13.550
the orphanage will be illegal.

00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:18.630
Mom, where's Daddy?

00:25:26.105 --> 00:25:28.425
How'd you do! How'd
you do! How'd you do!

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:31.035
Go on, Mr. Punch!

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.935
Ooh, a blue ribbon.

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:34.805
She's Touched!

00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:36.746
That's it! She's Touched!

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:38.176
What are we gonna do with her, then?

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:40.045
I'll touch you, alright, with this!

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:44.185
Stop or I'll use my turn!

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:46.955
Here's a turn for you!

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:50.685
Harder! Harder! Beat her!

00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:53.026
Beat the Touched! Beat
the Touched! Beat the Touched!

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:55.825
Yeah! We'll take them all to Hell!

00:25:57.270 --> 00:25:59.865
Oh, my baby!

00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:01.795
Bye-bye, baby! Bye-bye!

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:12.645
That's the way we do it!

00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:14.176
That's the way we do it!

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:16.485
That's the way we do!

00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:19.785
Thank you very much! Thank you
very much! Thank you very much!

00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:26.795
- That's right!
- There you go.

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.866
Thank you very much! Thank you
very much, ladies and gentlemen.

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:30.795
Thank you very much.

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:32.230
Thank you very much.

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:37.835
Rob, my boy!

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.275
Well done.

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:42.245
Well done. Exactly what we needed.

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:45.415
Hearts and minds.
This is just the beginning.

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:48.080
We've got a lot going on. We can't stop.

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:52.190
No, it has to be today.

00:26:52.195 --> 00:26:54.115
- As soon as possible.
- Today?

00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:01.195
Bore someone else with the
details. Just make it happen.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.295
Draw me a bath.

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:04.695
Send that telegram.

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:06.265
Yes, ma'am. Right away, ma'am.

00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:10.635
Oh my... Oh, my God. Um...

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:12.205
La-Lavinia.

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:14.235
Wha...

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:18.510
Oh, my God! My God! W-what happened?

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.915
Oh...

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:22.985
There was an incident in the carriage.

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:24.245
It was quite an ordeal.

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:25.985
God, that's awful.

00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:28.455
- Yeah...
- I'm so glad that you're alright.

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:31.495
Well, that remains to be seen.

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:34.555
Well, it was... It was
really lovely of you

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:36.625
to have left the fundraiser to Augie.

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:38.765
- It's a real show of confidence.
- Yes, yes.

00:27:38.770 --> 00:27:40.035
Um...

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:42.665
I-I hope you don't mind,
Vinnie, but in your absence,

00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:44.870
I took the liberty
of finalizing the plans.

00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:47.640
Mind?

00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:50.745
Not in the least.

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:52.575
So, you don't?

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:55.045
No. Well, someone had to do it.
Thank you, Augie.

00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:56.585
Mm, mm-hmm.

00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:59.015
Well, I'd best get ready.

00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:00.755
Are you staying for lunch, Ms. Adair?

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:02.425
Yes. Yes, she is.

00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:05.655
Only if you approve.

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:07.795
Of course, my darling.

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.326
But we need to find you
something to wear.

00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:10.565
You can't come like that.

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:12.735
Maybe one of the Paris dresses.

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:14.235
After all,

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:17.070
I never did get a chance to wear them.

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:21.005
- Come along, Ms. Adair.
- Lavinia...

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:22.905
Don't worry, Augie.

00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:24.550
I'll take good care of her.

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:34.020
Ye... Well, go.

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:29.910
Sarah?

00:29:31.450 --> 00:29:32.680
Sarah?

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:34.915
What are you doing in here?

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.785
Nothing.

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:38.385
Nothing. I-I was just...

00:29:38.390 --> 00:29:40.115
I was just...

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:41.985
I was just... I just...
I just wanted to, um...

00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:44.885
There, there. You're alright. Calm down.

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:47.300
You sent me away.

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:50.700
Sent you? Wh...

00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:53.165
Is that why...

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:01.035
You were melancholic.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.005
Just inexplicably sad.

00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:05.180
And I'd tried everything
to lift your spirits.

00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:08.480
But nothing I did...

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:12.755
And so, to protect you from yourself,

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:14.820
I...

00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:19.155
I sacrificed our family,

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.630
our hopes and dreams, our...

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:24.070
our future.

00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:26.670
For you.

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:30.905
It's all for you, my darling.

00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:32.740
I did it all for you.

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.750
Oh...

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:44.750
Please don't cry.

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.690
I'm sorry.

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:50.060
I'm so sorry.

00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:52.395
How sorry?

00:30:57.870 --> 00:30:59.930
I'll do anything.

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:01.540
Anything?

00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:05.010
Anything.

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:08.505
Give me your hand.

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:10.140
My hand?

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:16.415
Lester, Lester, no, please! No!

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:18.716
- Please, don't! No, no, no, no, no, no, no...
- Believe me!

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.986
- This hurts me a lot more than it hurts you.
- No, Lester, Lester, please!

00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:22.855
No, no, no, no! No, no, no!

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:41.580
My office is off limits.

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:53.150
Do you understand?

00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:29.525
Tell me.

00:32:30.229 --> 00:32:31.925
Who is the enchanting-looking
young woman

00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:33.325
at the end of the table?

00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:35.465
She favors you in your younger days.

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:38.230
Before everything went wrong?

00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:50.440
Your sister is staring.

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:56.485
Because you look beautiful.

00:32:56.490 --> 00:32:58.385
- Dress suits you.
- Hm.

00:32:58.390 --> 00:33:00.485
- It was very kind of her to offer it.
- Mm-hmm.

00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:02.155
But it is funny. I always...

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:04.430
- I always thought she disliked me.
- Me, too.

00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:09.495
Oh, n-no. Sorry, no. Um, me.

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:11.495
N-not you. I thought she disliked me.

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:12.900
But she's your sister.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.470
Yeah, I know.

00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:18.070
Maybe you're wrong.

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:21.535
Well, I suppose we'll see.

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:22.680
We'll see what?

00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:24.905
Augie?

00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:33.955
Lavinia. Uh, sorry. I know
this is your occasion,

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:36.860
but I hope you'll allow me
to say a few words.

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:44.295
Yes, of course, Augustus.

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:51.565
I-I-I'm not... I'm not very
good at speeches. Uh,

00:33:51.570 --> 00:33:53.035
the words tend to get...

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:56.110
words tend to get all
jumbled up in my, um...

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:04.445
But I-I'm not jumbled now.

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:07.855
But I feel... I feel clearer today

00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:09.490
than I've ever felt in my life.

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:15.430
So, I'd like to propose a toast.

00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:21.495
To my sister.

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:23.040
Mm...

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:38.515
- Yes?
- Yes!

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:40.585
Hello. I'm here for the party.

00:34:40.990 --> 00:34:43.425
Master and Mistress are indisposed.

00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:45.525
Actually, uh...

00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:47.525
What is that? Is that mahogany?

00:34:47.530 --> 00:34:49.295
- It's lovely.
- Sir...

00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:53.465
When our father died, you stepped in.

00:34:53.470 --> 00:34:56.535
And th-th-that's not only to manage
o-our family's interests,

00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:59.005
but also to manage me.

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:04.140
And I-I-I'm exceedingly
grateful to you for that.

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:07.775
For everything.

00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:10.250
'Cause you just did so much

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:12.290
for so long.

00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:15.925
And...

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:19.825
th-th-that's why I've decided
that it's time to relieve you

00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:22.195
of some of that burden by
assuming control of the estate.

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:24.765
As our father's only son,

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:26.365
it is rightfully mine.

00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:28.940
The house, the lands, and...

00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:32.305
and the orphanage.

00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:33.805
No, d-don't worry, Lavinia.

00:35:33.810 --> 00:35:35.435
I'll still keep you in all the finery

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:37.005
to which you've become accustomed.

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:38.575
You can still have your gowns

00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:41.175
a-a-and y-your hats.

00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:43.245
And those little cakes that you like.

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:46.555
- Augie...
- I just... I really believe that it is high time

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:50.160
that the home for the Touched
is run by someone who...

00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:53.795
who actually is... who...

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:56.425
Someone who ac... who is... who...

00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:58.530
who is actually,
a-a-as a matter of fact...

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:02.235
- himself...
- Well, alright!

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:05.505
Okay! You win...

00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:07.475
♪ I'm in love with you ♪

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:09.545
Oh, I didn't realize
there'd be entertainment.

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:11.107
- Ms. Bidlow!
- What are you doing here?

00:36:11.111 --> 00:36:12.447
Well, I'm here to show my support.

00:36:12.451 --> 00:36:14.615
Wh-what is the meaning
of this intrusion?

00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:16.885
Shall I tell them all the lengths

00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:18.716
- I've gone to for the cause?
- Lavinia,

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:21.255
what's he talking about?
Who is this man?

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:23.785
- Collins? Lay an extra place, please.
- Ah.

00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:25.185
What?

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:26.855
Hm, here,

00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:28.825
- I think.
- Lavinia!

00:36:29.330 --> 00:36:31.025
I said add a place!

00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:37.205
You...

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:39.705
This gentleman will be
joining us for lunch.

00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:47.550
Everyone, as you were.

00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:50.885
A-as you were, everybody.

00:36:50.890 --> 00:36:52.615
Ooh. Ah.

00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:00.725
Y-you didn't tell me
you were going to do that.

00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:01.930
I wanted to surprise you.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.425
Won't your sister be upset though?

00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:06.170
Just don't worry about her.

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:10.005
Ms. Adair, I presume?

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:12.505
- Y-yeah. Yes.
- Oh! It's...

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:14.180
It's an honor.

00:37:25.155 --> 00:37:27.455
So, the plan is I distract Massen?

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:29.655
The plan is you get me through the gate

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:31.385
and you stay out of me fuckin' way.

00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:32.926
I thought I was distracting
Massen while you went

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:34.955
to search for secret papers.

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:38.325
Um, unpaid taxes, blood rights,
that sort of thing.

00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:41.795
- Evidence?
- Exactly. Something to take Massen down,

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:43.005
not get yourself killed

00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:44.865
in some ridiculous
display of masculinity.

00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:46.936
If you don't like my methods,
then you know you...

00:37:46.941 --> 00:37:49.846
I'm here, aren't I? Let's just...

00:37:49.851 --> 00:37:52.411
Let's just not be rash.

00:37:56.490 --> 00:37:57.785
That means stupid.

00:37:57.790 --> 00:38:00.890
I know what it fuckin' means,
you fuckin' prat!

00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:05.485
Shut up.

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:13.065
A bit unkempt for Lavinia, isn't he?

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:15.335
- American.
- An inventor?

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:17.005
Oh! How wonderful!

00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:19.305
And what sort of things do you invent?

00:38:19.310 --> 00:38:20.705
I don't know, just this and that.

00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:22.305
Whatever is needed, really.

00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:23.906
I think there's such
beauty in inventing.

00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:25.346
In arranging parts and pieces together

00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:26.815
to make a wondrous whole.

00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:29.075
And then there's that moment
when, when everything

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:30.715
sparks to life.

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:32.445
A-and, well, it-it-it's...

00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:34.415
- It's otherworldly.
- Precisely!

00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:36.025
Precisely.

00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:39.060
Mr. Bidlow, what was it you
were about to say before?

00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:42.625
- High time for?
- Oh, nothing.

00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:46.995
The moment passed.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.235
Yes!

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:50.005
- Yes!
- Yes. Yeah, exactly.

00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:51.770
Um, Ms. Adair?

00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:55.005
Sorry.

00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:56.775
- Sorry. Excuse me.
- Oh.

00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:59.545
Sorry. You, um, you are
meant to be my guest.

00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:02.016
Oh, I-I thought that was
the point of these things.

00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:04.220
You talk to people
you don't really know.

00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:08.885
Uh, sorry.

00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:10.585
What was I saying? Um...

00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:15.830
He's here, ma'am.

00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:18.800
Keep an eye on them.

00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:21.565
Excuse me.

00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:35.820
Lord Massen.

00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:38.050
Ms. Bidlow.

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:42.790
Thank you for coming
at such short notice.

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:47.795
It's so rare to meet someone
who sees the world like I do.

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.625
Oh, Ms. Adair.

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:52.695
I would love to see
the world through your eyes.

00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:54.835
To see her.

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:58.905
All wisping amber waves of light.

00:39:59.810 --> 00:40:01.705
Currents.

00:40:01.710 --> 00:40:05.075
Reflecting and diffusing.

00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:07.245
H-how do you know about... ?

00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:08.845
Oh, Ms. Adair.

00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:11.485
I know much more than that.

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.985
We have, in the past, found ourselves

00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:18.285
on opposing sides in
the matter of the Touched.

00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:19.695
We have.

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:22.095
You have often expressed your
opinion that their afflictions

00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:25.525
are caused by some great and powerful...

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:26.570
enemy.

00:40:26.574 --> 00:40:29.165
If you are attempting to change
my mind once again,

00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:31.465
Ms. Bidlow, it is a cause as lost

00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:34.005
as the one you so desperately support.

00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:35.635
The Prosperity of London Bill

00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:37.375
is up for a vote tonight, is it not?

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:40.715
- It is.
- And as I understand it,

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:44.115
- your amendment hangs in the balance.
- You needn't worry.

00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:45.945
My peers have made it very clear

00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:48.855
that they have no intention
of letting it pass.

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:50.525
Apparently, there's a feeling

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:54.095
that I have overstepped the bounds.

00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:55.825
I'm hardly surprised.

00:40:55.830 --> 00:40:58.425
Men are like babies and can
rarely see beyond the next feed.

00:40:58.430 --> 00:41:00.435
But that is no matter.

00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:03.805
Because what I have here will give you

00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:06.605
all the ammunition
you need to sway the vote.

00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:08.706
You're offering your support
to an amendment

00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:10.975
that would dismantle your own orphanage?

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:17.285
Lord Massen, there can be
no community for the Touched

00:41:17.290 --> 00:41:19.515
while evil walks among them.

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:21.415
And I have seen it.

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:23.290
I have looked in its face.

00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:26.660
A face so...

00:41:27.830 --> 00:41:29.195
familiar to me

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:31.130
that I cannot bear it.

00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:35.265
It must be destroyed.

00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:37.565
Pluck it out by the root.

00:41:37.570 --> 00:41:39.370
Burn it in the fire.

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:42.980
You have only to strike the match.

00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:57.085
I don't understand.

00:41:57.090 --> 00:41:59.225
One hears all sorts of whispers

00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:01.430
down the telephone lines.

00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:05.995
Are you Dr. Hague?

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.435
No. Call me Edmund.

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:09.635
- I'd rather not.
- No, no, no, no.

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:11.935
Don't you want to know

00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:15.280
what it was you encountered
that day in your workshop?

00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:19.545
At once marvelous and miraculous?

00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:22.050
Like infinite possibility and hope?

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:26.255
Could you really bear...

00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:27.790
not knowing?

00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:31.330
I could show you.

00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:37.700
I have a carriage just beyond the gates.

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:40.465
I leave in 10 minutes.

00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:43.900
With or without you.

00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:58.920
About fucking time.

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:02.320
Penance?

00:43:04.330 --> 00:43:06.025
Ms. Adair?

00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:07.390
Hello?

00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:11.395
Oh. I-I'm sorry.

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:13.830
I-I-I was just thinking about, um...

00:43:14.970 --> 00:43:17.805
Amalia couldn't stay.

00:43:17.810 --> 00:43:20.470
She was being pulled by something...

00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:24.210
bigger. A-a-a kind of...

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:30.415
I'm so sorry.

00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:31.920
I think I have to go.

00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:35.960
Oh, yes, o-of course. Of course.

00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:40.260
Thank you.

00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:55.075
The Lord God said to rally the troops,

00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:56.175
prepare 'em for battle.

00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:58.345
Yeah, we know. We know.

00:43:58.350 --> 00:44:00.145
Drink your ale before it gets warm.

00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:04.620
Can I get some Irish whiskey?

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:12.155
This thing is fuckin' creepy.

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:13.695
Gimme that.

00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:16.160
Oi! Make way!

00:44:18.330 --> 00:44:20.365
You fuckin' deaf?

00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:22.535
The girl said move.

00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:24.840
I guarantee you don't
wanna piss her off.

00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:31.310
First installment. Have a gander.

00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:35.320
Just a little taste though.

00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:40.215
When do we get the rest?

00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:42.155
When you get your marching orders.

00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:44.155
The hour of retribution is at hand!

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:46.695
Is it now? You wait
for my word, Preacher.

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:48.825
- Do you understand?
- We understand, King.

00:44:48.830 --> 00:44:50.695
Now, who's gonna get me a drink?

00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:53.795
Ol' Punch over there will sort you out.

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:55.765
Oi, that whiskey's two shillings.

00:44:58.810 --> 00:45:00.270
Watch it.

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:17.285
Oi! Doctor! Odd place for your type

00:45:17.290 --> 00:45:19.695
to be wettin' their whistle,
don't you think?

00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:21.625
I was just having a drink.

00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:23.725
- Just having a drink?
- Yes.

00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:26.835
- And now I'm finished, and I'm going home.
- Finished? Yes.

00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:29.335
Home? No.

00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:31.405
Can't have you telling
your little friends back

00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:33.875
at the orphanage what we're
up to with the Purists.

00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:36.840
- I won't say a word.
- Fucking right you won't.

00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:46.750
Stop. Stop.

00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:32.270
Darling?

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.435
You coming to bed?

00:46:36.610 --> 00:46:38.140
I'll be there in a minute.

00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:58.160
Hello.

00:46:58.930 --> 00:47:00.355
Well, hello.

00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:13.575
Well, you're in a better mood.

00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:15.410
- I am.
- Hm...

00:47:16.310 --> 00:47:18.545
I like it.

00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:20.175
I thought you might.

00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:22.245
Not so fast.

00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:24.285
Let's play a game.

00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:26.616
It's called, "How long can
you hold your breath?"

00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:28.055
You first.

00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:29.985
What?

00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:45.465
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:47.535
Playing a game. Don't you like games?

00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:48.575
No!

00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:06.995
One... two...

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.155
93!

00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:12.095
Three... 42... 43...

00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:17.540
23... 47... 48...

00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:21.435
Lester...

00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:23.940
Lester?

00:48:25.710 --> 00:48:27.645
What's that, darling?

00:48:27.650 --> 00:48:29.645
Fucking bitch.

00:48:29.650 --> 00:48:31.220
I thought that's what you said.

00:48:34.490 --> 00:48:36.620
I win. Mwah.

00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:00.310
What's the matter, love?

00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:05.790
Yeah.

00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:08.390
I know the feeling.

00:49:10.130 --> 00:49:11.190
We all do.

00:49:12.330 --> 00:49:13.330
Well?

00:49:18.070 --> 00:49:21.130
Come on, then!

00:49:32.310 --> 00:49:33.710
Ready.

00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:37.615
Ready.

00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:39.085
- Are you insane?!
- Are you?

00:49:39.090 --> 00:49:40.515
Oh, my God, put it away!

00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:42.960
- Put it away.
- I've put it away.

00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:57.805
Beechy!

00:49:57.810 --> 00:49:59.270
Lord Swann.

00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:02.405
We weren't expecting you.

00:50:02.410 --> 00:50:04.305
- Did you not get my telegram?
- No.

00:50:04.310 --> 00:50:05.705
No? Are you sure?

00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:07.745
I know I expressly
told Rupert to send it.

00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:09.515
It never arrived, sir.

00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:12.285
Oh. Huh. Well, I'm here now.

00:50:12.290 --> 00:50:14.115
Never mind. Should we go inside?

00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:16.255
Oh, but the master isn't in.

00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:17.925
- Isn't he?
- No.

00:50:17.930 --> 00:50:20.225
Well, that's marvelous.
I get you all to myself.

00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:21.825
Uh, I'm sorry, Lord Swann,

00:50:21.830 --> 00:50:23.795
but we're not receiving guests.

00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:26.195
Beechy, surely that doesn't include me?

00:50:28.270 --> 00:50:29.865
Um... You...

00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:32.235
You must have heard
about my father, of course.

00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:34.275
- Of course, sir, yes.
- Uh...

00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:36.735
I've, uh, been in a terrible state.

00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:38.645
Really awful.

00:50:38.650 --> 00:50:40.176
Do you know, the only thing
which I think will make it

00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:41.745
remotely bearable is a cup of tea

00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:43.845
and one of your wonderful brandy balls.

00:50:43.850 --> 00:50:46.115
I just made a fresh batch.

00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:49.455
Come in. But, don't tell the master.

00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:51.125
I wouldn't dream of it.

00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:25.885
Mm!

00:51:25.890 --> 00:51:28.130
Mm. Beechy...

00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:30.725
Mm.

00:51:30.730 --> 00:51:32.900
We never did see eye-to-eye.

00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:35.895
He never warmed to me the way...

00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:39.270
- Hm.
- Well, the way he did to my brother.

00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:45.575
I suppose I was always a bit odd!

00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:47.715
A bit too inquisitive!

00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:49.275
And he didn't like that! You know,

00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:50.885
asking the wrong sort of questions,

00:51:50.890 --> 00:51:53.615
never knowing when to shut up!

00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:56.385
Too cheeky for his tastes.

00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:57.685
He thought I ought to...

00:51:57.690 --> 00:52:00.795
Uh, toe the line. Live up

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:04.465
- to the family name!
- Hm...

00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:06.595
Be more serious, I think. Yeah.

00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:09.000
Act a more serious child.

00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:15.640
More balls?

00:52:39.830 --> 00:52:41.500
What is that, Beechy?

00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:46.265
Sometimes, fathers make mistakes.

00:52:46.270 --> 00:52:47.940
Take your father.

00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:50.310
It wasn't cheek you had.

00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:53.010
It was spirit.

00:53:25.810 --> 00:53:28.150
Lord Swann.

00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:30.280
Try the key, dear.

00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:42.295
Oh, my God.

00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:52.510
Hello, Lillie.

00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:13.190
Sir.

00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:22.035
Oh, there you are.

00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:23.835
You disappeared.

00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:25.470
Just like Ms. Adair.

00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:29.805
Do you know, in the future,

00:54:29.810 --> 00:54:31.806
I think I might have someone
draw up a little schedule

00:54:31.810 --> 00:54:34.010
for you, so I know
where you are at all times.

00:54:35.420 --> 00:54:36.745
Wh-what is it?

00:54:36.750 --> 00:54:38.990
The last of our guests
has finally arrived.

00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:42.415
Wha...

00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:44.455
What are you... Ah!
Lavinia, what the hell?

00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:46.025
What is this? No! This is...

00:54:46.030 --> 00:54:47.525
Oh, don't make a fuss.

00:54:47.530 --> 00:54:49.725
Just like you said, we all need

00:54:49.730 --> 00:54:51.995
to be relieved of our
burdens once in a while.

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:53.095
Thank you.

00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:11.515
Lavinia!

00:57:00.060 --> 00:57:01.655
You're gonna need it.

00:57:11.445 --> 00:57:18.945
