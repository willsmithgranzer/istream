1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,880
I heard him call for his
people to attack Herot.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,360
Beowulf has told your
mother of Abrecan's betrayal.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,160
She's about to ride to Bregan.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,320
- Let me take your place.
- Step aside!

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,040
Whatever he's done, Abrecan
won't harm her.

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,040
I have a proposition for you
from Abrecan, Bregan's Thane.

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,000
Soon 200 Wulfing
warriors will be ashore.

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,120
They won't just plunder, they'll kill.

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,960
Not only am I your
sister, I am also your Jarl.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,080
For today. A decree stating
you'll relinquish your claim

11
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,760
to be both Jarl of the
Shieldlands and Thane of Herot.

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,320
I would never do that to my son.

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,720
Of course, your son. He was the one
who laid the false blame on the Varni

14
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,600
even though he knew it was
I who moved against you.

15
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,080
- He is beyond saving.
- But you're not. And Herot needs you.

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,920
With that at your side, who
could stand in your way?

22
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,800
Skellan.

23
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,040
Warfather of the Wulfing clans.

24
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,445
Your man here promised us all the

25
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,880
gold and iron my men could carry.

26
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,320
You'll have more.

27
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,760
But first, I must have your oath...

28
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,720
..that you and your men will
follow my leadership.

29
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,440
We'll do what we want.
That is the Wulfing way...

30
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,640
Hold... your tongue.

31
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,480
You have my oath.

32
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,400
Then Herot will fall.

33
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,480
In case we're attacked, we
need Huskarla at every gatepost.

34
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,040
Each in command of at least five
men, be they townsfolk or smelters.

35
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,080
And post sentries on each
of the five surrounding hills.

36
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,040
And they need to be
able to see over the hori...

37
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,600
Mother.

38
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,200
Rheda, stop.

39
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,240
- What's going on?
- Lock him up.

40
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,560
Now!

41
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,040
I need good reason.

42
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,800
My brother has betrayed us.

43
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,000
He has allied Bregan with the Wulfings

44
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,320
and now an army marches on
Herot all because of my son.

45
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,640
Take his father's sword.

46
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,200
Is this true?

47
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,840
A traitor...

48
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,040
in league with traitors.

49
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I said, lock him up!

50
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,784
An army marches on us, to seize

51
00:05:54,809 --> 00:05:57,520
our homes and steal our freedom.

52
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,960
Why do you stand there?

53
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,360
Come on, move!

54
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,360
Abrecan was behind all this?

55
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,640
Scorann's death? Bayen's murder?

56
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,320
And he did it all with Slean's help?

57
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,320
Beowulf.

58
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,840
The Wulfing ships line our shores.

59
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,400
Send riders to the Mere,
the Banning, the Wisdeth.

60
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,840
Tell them Herot is under attack.

61
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,480
Tell them to send their men.
We need them to stand with us.

62
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,840
You must send word to the Varni.

63
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,880
No, no, no.

64
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,280
The other tribes won't make it in time.

65
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,102
The Varni are closer. And the Varni

66
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,520
aren't farmers or fishermen.

67
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,560
You'd have me send to Rate?

68
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,520
Have you lost your wits?

69
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,160
I expelled him from this hall.

70
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,640
I banished them from the alliance.

71
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,440
Well, tell them you were mistaken.

72
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,059
Don't let your people die because you

73
00:07:02,084 --> 00:07:03,680
are too proud to admit you are wrong!

74
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,200
It's pointless!

75
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,160
Any messenger I send to Rate will
be sent back to us in pieces.

76
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,360
Then I'll go.

77
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,200
I'm the only one he'll listen to.

78
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,000
- I need you here.
- The defences are in hand.

79
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,349
One man riding hard and fast, I can

80
00:07:22,374 --> 00:07:24,200
be back before the Wulfings get here.

81
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,840
Two men.

82
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,320
I am Varni, after
all. I know their ways.

83
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,080
We would at least stand a
chance against Abrecan's army.

84
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,960
I'll lead them to Herot.

85
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Go. Do as I have asked.

86
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,560
- And then?
- Return to Bregan.

87
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,600
You're needed there.

88
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,640
The next time we meet... you'll be Jarl.

89
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,880
Until Herot.

90
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,120
So...

91
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,720
We follow the river until the pass.

92
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,840
And then head for the Draca bridge.

93
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,400
We'll scout the way first and
then the army will follow.

94
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,480
The bridge is the quickest
route but they'll know that.

95
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,760
We should take the
forests. Surprise them.

96
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,120
No. The forest is full of Barghest.

97
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,480
And are the men of
Bregan afraid of beasts?

98
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,160
The men of Bregan had you on your knees.

99
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,063
They could have
spilled your guts onto the

100
00:08:29,088 --> 00:08:30,840
sand and left you for the crabs to eat.

101
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,200
Don't you forget it.

102
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,960
- We take the bridge.
- We take the bridge.

103
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Get the dogs.

104
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,320
He should learn some manners.

105
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,280
Why? He's a Wulfing.

106
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,800
Good work, lads.

107
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,320
Abrecan and his Wulfing
army will be here soon enough.

108
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,360
So let's be ready for them.

109
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,280
And back! Come on!

110
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,720
The Wulfings won't care if you're tired!

111
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,160
Come on! Put your backs in it!

112
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,920
My son.

113
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,160
I have something to give you.

114
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,680
There.

115
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,400
Don't measure yourself by me.

116
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,800
You'll always be less.

117
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,480
If you're here to say I
disappoint you, join the queue.

118
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,560
You'll find I'm just at the front.

119
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,240
And my mother. And Beowulf.

120
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,640
And the rest of Herot.

121
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,000
You never judged me.
How could I judge you?

122
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,120
I slandered Rate...

123
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,720
banished the Varni.

124
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,200
And now they're our only hope.

125
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,240
Beowulf can appeal to his sense
of honour, but he won't forgive.

126
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,920
If he won't listen, give him this.

127
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,040
Only if all else fails.

128
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,720
Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.

129
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,120
I'm surprised you're still here.

130
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,720
- So am I.
- Why are you still with us?

131
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,765
I thought it would be nice if the gates

132
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,920
are finished before
the Wulfing get here.

133
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,800
Lila's working on them.

134
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,000
So you could help. Talk to her.

135
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,920
The way I see it, chances are we're
all dead tomorrow in any case,

136
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,120
so why have awkward conversations?

137
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,120
If you're dead tomorrow, why not?

138
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,435
You shouldn't be in here.

139
00:12:51,915 --> 00:12:53,915
Neither should you.

140
00:13:04,955 --> 00:13:06,955
It's not the marriage I dreamed of.

141
00:13:08,195 --> 00:13:10,195
Living a lie, sleeping alone.

142
00:13:10,235 --> 00:13:11,835
Now this.

143
00:13:13,075 --> 00:13:15,795
Perhaps you got
yourself put in here on purpose.

144
00:13:16,555 --> 00:13:18,595
Some men don't like commitment.

145
00:13:21,995 --> 00:13:23,995
You can't help me, Kela.

146
00:13:25,835 --> 00:13:28,075
Even if I was free, the
Wulfings are coming.

147
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:32,155
Our allies won't make it in time.
There is nothing that can be done.

148
00:13:32,195 --> 00:13:34,315
There's always something.

149
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,355
And I won't let you give up.

150
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,875
Find me Gil of the Huskarla.

151
00:13:53,955 --> 00:13:55,755
Bring him to me.

152
00:14:07,475 --> 00:14:08,595
I said no.

153
00:14:08,635 --> 00:14:10,995
Slean would do anything for
the Huskarla, you know that.

154
00:14:11,035 --> 00:14:13,315
Do I? Do you? He betrayed us all.

155
00:14:13,355 --> 00:14:16,395
Stand and face me. I'm
your Thane's daughter by law!

156
00:14:17,635 --> 00:14:19,635
My husband was your commander.

157
00:14:21,435 --> 00:14:22,635
It's just a title.

158
00:14:22,675 --> 00:14:24,795
And do you think he wore it lightly?

159
00:14:24,835 --> 00:14:28,355
I was there when he washed the
body of your fallen comrade.

160
00:14:30,235 --> 00:14:32,235
Slean's scars were earned.

161
00:14:32,275 --> 00:14:35,315
In the same places as
yours, at your side.

162
00:14:37,435 --> 00:14:39,522
If Beowulf fails to convince the Varni

163
00:14:39,547 --> 00:14:41,419
to join us, we'll all die anyway.

164
00:14:43,635 --> 00:14:46,515
All he asks is that you
listen to what he has to say.

165
00:14:54,275 --> 00:14:58,235
Gil, I promise I knew
nothing about the Wulfing army.

166
00:15:02,195 --> 00:15:04,195
What do you want from me, Slean?

167
00:15:05,795 --> 00:15:07,595
Has Rheda sent word to our allies?

168
00:15:07,635 --> 00:15:08,955
Yes.

169
00:15:10,395 --> 00:15:12,395
They'll not be here in time, though.

170
00:15:12,435 --> 00:15:14,595
If we buy them the
time, the Banning might.

171
00:15:16,395 --> 00:15:17,475
How?

172
00:15:19,275 --> 00:15:20,675
Draca bridge.

173
00:15:21,715 --> 00:15:23,315
With a dozen Huskarla.

174
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:25,955
We might be able to hold them
off for at least a day.

175
00:15:25,995 --> 00:15:28,715
That might be just enough
time for them to get here.

176
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:33,995
Come on, Gil. The Huskarla's
job is to protect Herot.

177
00:15:34,635 --> 00:15:36,715
Even if it means dying for it.

178
00:15:37,795 --> 00:15:40,955
This could be Herot's only chance.

179
00:16:14,355 --> 00:16:16,795
If I'd known you planned to
die, I'd never have helped.

180
00:16:16,835 --> 00:16:18,635
Which is why I didn't tell you.

181
00:16:18,675 --> 00:16:21,595
Kela... thank you.

182
00:16:23,995 --> 00:16:25,595
What are you doing here, Vishka?

183
00:16:25,635 --> 00:16:27,915
Coming with you to the bridge.

184
00:16:27,955 --> 00:16:30,555
- No.
- You heard him.

185
00:16:30,595 --> 00:16:32,275
You know I can fight.

186
00:16:32,315 --> 00:16:33,835
Better than him, you said.

187
00:16:39,395 --> 00:16:40,795
All right.

188
00:16:47,595 --> 00:16:49,595
And you need
someone to look out for you.

189
00:16:51,075 --> 00:16:53,075
You tell Lila about this?

190
00:16:53,115 --> 00:16:56,435
- She'd only worry.
- You don't think she'd have a point?

191
00:17:05,635 --> 00:17:07,915
Well, this looks homely.

192
00:17:07,954 --> 00:17:10,635
The Varni prefer their
creature comforts dead.

193
00:17:10,675 --> 00:17:12,675
No wonder you left.

194
00:17:12,714 --> 00:17:15,115
And swore I'd never return.

195
00:17:18,755 --> 00:17:20,755
Leave the horses.

196
00:17:27,234 --> 00:17:29,795
On foot, we look less of a threat.

197
00:17:30,515 --> 00:17:32,515
On foot, we are less of a threat.

198
00:17:43,475 --> 00:17:45,475
How do we find Rate?

199
00:17:45,515 --> 00:17:47,515
He'll find us.

200
00:17:52,435 --> 00:17:53,715
Stand still.

201
00:17:53,755 --> 00:17:56,435
Varr. You piece of filth.

202
00:17:57,795 --> 00:18:01,395
It's good to see you, too.
Beowulf, you remember Argat?

203
00:18:02,355 --> 00:18:04,675
My only surviving half-brother.

204
00:18:06,075 --> 00:18:08,155
I'm not sensing much brotherly love.

205
00:18:15,235 --> 00:18:16,515
Beowulf.

206
00:18:17,715 --> 00:18:21,035
I promised the next time
we met, I'd kill you.

207
00:18:38,235 --> 00:18:40,395
I thought of it more as
a threat than a promise.

208
00:18:40,435 --> 00:18:42,435
You thought wrong, then.

209
00:18:45,035 --> 00:18:46,955
You've got rusty.

210
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:49,275
I tripped.

211
00:18:49,915 --> 00:18:51,955
Right. The tent beat you.

212
00:18:53,115 --> 00:18:54,355
Exactly.

213
00:19:06,515 --> 00:19:09,515
Argat, get them water and
then bring them to my tent.

214
00:19:25,475 --> 00:19:28,355
They can't flank us, they can't pass us.

215
00:19:31,035 --> 00:19:33,035
They'll have to fight.

216
00:19:34,475 --> 00:19:37,475
And for as long as we hold
out, there's hope for our people.

217
00:19:40,475 --> 00:19:43,795
The middle of the bridge. That's
where we make our stand.

218
00:19:59,955 --> 00:20:01,635
Check the end of the bridge.

219
00:20:26,435 --> 00:20:27,755
All clear!

220
00:21:09,915 --> 00:21:11,715
Did you know?

221
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:18,075
Know what?

222
00:21:20,755 --> 00:21:22,755
About my son's betrayal.

223
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,195
Tell me.

224
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:32,595
Do you think you can
choose to hold your tongue?

225
00:21:34,355 --> 00:21:37,275
- I am your Thane.
- And Slean is my husband.

226
00:21:39,115 --> 00:21:42,755
What sort of wife would I
be to turn on him so easily?

227
00:21:44,435 --> 00:21:46,355
The wife of a man in chains.

228
00:21:47,315 --> 00:21:50,395
And yet you send
messengers to beg my tribe to aid you.

229
00:21:57,595 --> 00:21:59,595
Then I will ask him myself.

230
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:01,795
You'll find that hard.

231
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:05,395
He is no longer in chains.

232
00:22:08,315 --> 00:22:10,995
Slean has gone to stop the
Wulfing, to cut them off.

233
00:22:12,155 --> 00:22:16,435
He and his Huskarla will buy
you the time for help to reach us.

234
00:22:18,195 --> 00:22:21,275
If Herot still stands
tomorrow it will be his doing.

235
00:22:22,235 --> 00:22:26,195
Where? Where has he gone?

236
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:31,275
Draca bridge.

237
00:22:34,195 --> 00:22:36,275
And he will not come back alive.

238
00:22:38,435 --> 00:22:40,435
But he will die with honour.

239
00:22:46,635 --> 00:22:47,835
Charge!

240
00:22:53,555 --> 00:22:55,555
Reset!

241
00:22:57,355 --> 00:22:59,355
Hold!

242
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:02,755
- Hold!
- Hey!

243
00:23:04,595 --> 00:23:06,915
Come on. Come here!

244
00:23:11,915 --> 00:23:13,035
Vishka!

245
00:23:19,155 --> 00:23:21,315
Grab my hand. Come on, get up.

246
00:23:22,075 --> 00:23:24,075
Hold my hand!

247
00:23:44,675 --> 00:23:46,675
Where are you?

248
00:24:04,995 --> 00:24:06,995
You must stay away from Herot.

249
00:24:09,275 --> 00:24:10,675
It's dangerous.

250
00:24:15,195 --> 00:24:16,955
You followed me.

251
00:24:16,995 --> 00:24:20,755
I followed him. I knew
he would lead me to you.

252
00:24:22,395 --> 00:24:24,075
Leave him alone.

253
00:24:24,115 --> 00:24:26,115
I mean neither of you harm.

254
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:30,275
You and I, we are the
same, Skinshifters.

255
00:24:30,995 --> 00:24:33,195
We shouldn't be strangers to each other.

256
00:24:34,315 --> 00:24:35,795
Or enemies.

257
00:24:36,755 --> 00:24:38,555
On that we agree.

258
00:24:39,715 --> 00:24:42,475
Then don't attack
Herot. They're my people.

259
00:24:44,355 --> 00:24:46,395
Your people?

260
00:24:46,435 --> 00:24:48,274
What did Your people do when they

261
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:50,299
found a Skinshifter in their midst?

262
00:24:54,915 --> 00:24:56,915
How long before they turn on you?

263
00:24:57,795 --> 00:24:59,795
That's my concern.

264
00:25:01,555 --> 00:25:03,555
Don't harm them.

265
00:25:04,715 --> 00:25:05,955
Please.

266
00:25:07,355 --> 00:25:09,515
I have no intention of attacking Herot.

267
00:25:10,435 --> 00:25:11,955
I have no need.

268
00:25:11,995 --> 00:25:15,195
The Redbloods are about
to rip each other to pieces.

269
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:18,715
And I have a future to build.

270
00:25:19,795 --> 00:25:22,035
You could be a part of that future.

271
00:25:23,235 --> 00:25:27,955
You will never need to
lie, hide, or fear again.

272
00:25:29,955 --> 00:25:33,075
Or you can go back to
Herot and wait for death.

273
00:25:47,435 --> 00:25:49,395
Don't be scared now.

274
00:25:49,435 --> 00:25:51,435
I'm not.

275
00:25:51,475 --> 00:25:53,475
Good.

276
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:01,155
Your shaking's back.

277
00:26:01,195 --> 00:26:02,595
It's cold.

278
00:26:05,195 --> 00:26:06,915
Just worry about yourself, Slean.

279
00:26:12,915 --> 00:26:14,915
They're here.

280
00:26:28,635 --> 00:26:30,395
Abrecan!

281
00:26:49,795 --> 00:26:51,155
Slean.

282
00:26:53,355 --> 00:26:55,755
You already know how this ends.

283
00:26:56,835 --> 00:26:58,835
You have... a dozen men?

284
00:27:00,675 --> 00:27:02,475
And I...

285
00:27:04,435 --> 00:27:06,035
lead an army.

286
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,195
If you think you're leading them...

287
00:27:13,315 --> 00:27:15,515
then you really have lost your mind.

288
00:27:18,875 --> 00:27:20,955
The Wulfings will stab you in the back

289
00:27:21,795 --> 00:27:25,035
and walk right over your corpse
the moment you're no use to them.

290
00:27:26,835 --> 00:27:28,835
But there is a way back, Uncle.

291
00:27:30,195 --> 00:27:32,195
Send your men home.

292
00:27:33,515 --> 00:27:35,515
Stay here and fight with us.

293
00:27:38,395 --> 00:27:40,395
Die with honour.

294
00:27:45,675 --> 00:27:47,475
Is that what you want?

295
00:27:48,115 --> 00:27:49,915
To die here?

296
00:27:57,515 --> 00:27:59,355
Then go to our ancestors.

297
00:28:00,235 --> 00:28:01,555
Archers!

298
00:28:02,755 --> 00:28:04,275
Shields!

299
00:28:06,795 --> 00:28:08,795
Loose!

300
00:28:14,475 --> 00:28:16,475
- Loose!
- Open!

301
00:28:18,075 --> 00:28:19,355
Close!

302
00:28:19,395 --> 00:28:22,995
Rheda's troubles, whatever
they may be...

303
00:28:25,235 --> 00:28:26,755
are not mine.

304
00:28:26,795 --> 00:28:31,115
Rate, the survival of
Herot is in your hands.

305
00:28:31,995 --> 00:28:33,955
Just listen to what we ask.

306
00:28:33,995 --> 00:28:35,955
But you are not the first.

307
00:28:46,715 --> 00:28:48,715
Two sets of messengers.

308
00:28:48,755 --> 00:28:51,035
One from Herot, one from Bregan.

309
00:28:51,075 --> 00:28:54,595
Both so eager to be
heard, but which should I hear?

310
00:28:54,635 --> 00:28:57,915
This viper doesn't
deserve to be in your presence.

311
00:28:57,955 --> 00:29:00,675
Join with us. Take Herot by force.

312
00:29:00,715 --> 00:29:04,555
When he rules, Abrecan will see you
rewarded beyond your wildest dreams.

313
00:29:04,595 --> 00:29:06,400
Abrecan betrayed the alliance. Just

314
00:29:06,425 --> 00:29:08,155
as Rheda once claimed I had done.

315
00:29:08,195 --> 00:29:11,315
Because of his actions, your
brother Scorann is dead!

316
00:29:11,355 --> 00:29:14,115
- That was never Abrecan's intention!
- Enough!

317
00:29:17,075 --> 00:29:19,380
Why spill Varni
blood in a feud that is not

318
00:29:19,405 --> 00:29:21,475
of our making and not in our interest?

319
00:29:21,515 --> 00:29:23,675
No, fight your battles yourselves.

320
00:29:24,595 --> 00:29:25,875
Prove yourselves.

321
00:29:25,915 --> 00:29:29,075
Whichever side wins this
war shall have my support.

322
00:29:31,715 --> 00:29:34,355
Now leave. You're not welcome here.

323
00:29:34,395 --> 00:29:36,595
Get them out of my sight. Now!

324
00:29:36,635 --> 00:29:38,635
Wait!

325
00:29:42,955 --> 00:29:45,715
I am Varr... of the Varni.

326
00:29:48,075 --> 00:29:49,955
And I claim my bloodright.

327
00:29:54,195 --> 00:29:55,795
Well, that changes things.

328
00:30:09,395 --> 00:30:11,075
Whatever you feel for him,

329
00:30:11,115 --> 00:30:14,195
don't let his sacrifice be for nothing.

330
00:30:17,155 --> 00:30:19,155
Slean isn't ready.

331
00:30:21,595 --> 00:30:25,355
You must be Thane until he is.

332
00:30:59,795 --> 00:31:03,875
You know that my
brother is coming to visit us.

333
00:31:05,835 --> 00:31:07,795
Along with his friends.

334
00:31:07,835 --> 00:31:10,755
Some say that there's no
bond stronger than blood, but...

335
00:31:12,715 --> 00:31:14,715
I don't believe that.

336
00:31:16,155 --> 00:31:21,195
Iron and charcoal...
sweat brought us here.

337
00:31:22,235 --> 00:31:25,955
Opportunity. The chance
to carve out a future.

338
00:31:28,035 --> 00:31:32,475
May the ancestors forgive me,
but... that's stronger than blood.

339
00:31:34,555 --> 00:31:37,075
Let's give Abrecan a
welcome he can remember.

340
00:31:48,555 --> 00:31:50,555
Will the men hold?

341
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:54,035
They'll hold!

342
00:32:00,035 --> 00:32:02,035
Why have they stopped?

343
00:32:02,995 --> 00:32:04,995
Break.

344
00:32:17,675 --> 00:32:20,475
We can cut the snake's head
off before its army gets here.

345
00:32:22,475 --> 00:32:24,475
Come and fight me, Uncle!

346
00:32:25,795 --> 00:32:28,995
Or are your Wulfing
friends afraid of a few Huskarla?

347
00:32:31,515 --> 00:32:33,595
Destroy them!

348
00:32:35,675 --> 00:32:37,355
Charge!

349
00:32:52,755 --> 00:32:54,635
Advance!

350
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:26,035
Reform!

351
00:33:48,715 --> 00:33:50,435
Every moment we hold...

352
00:33:52,755 --> 00:33:56,035
allows our people time to prepare.

353
00:34:00,635 --> 00:34:03,075
Allows time for our allies to ride.

354
00:34:05,315 --> 00:34:08,333
People will talk of the Huskarla who

355
00:34:08,358 --> 00:34:11,619
held the Draca bridge for 500 summers.

356
00:34:12,435 --> 00:34:14,435
We will not be forgotten.

357
00:34:15,915 --> 00:34:17,995
None of you will ever be forgotten!

358
00:34:20,635 --> 00:34:23,034
We hold our lines!

359
00:34:27,074 --> 00:34:29,435
For Herot! For Herot!

360
00:34:35,594 --> 00:34:37,594
Slean will make a great Thane one day.

361
00:34:38,635 --> 00:34:42,195
So I won't have him
sacrificed at the hands of the Wulfing.

362
00:34:42,235 --> 00:34:43,835
That's my job.

363
00:34:44,635 --> 00:34:48,955
Now, Brinni, you take him back
to Herot. He's best needed there.

364
00:34:50,114 --> 00:34:52,275
Vishka, you too.

365
00:34:52,315 --> 00:34:54,114
I want to fight.

366
00:34:54,155 --> 00:34:57,355
No. You're the youngest
here with the most to live for.

367
00:34:58,795 --> 00:35:00,355
The both of you.

368
00:35:00,835 --> 00:35:02,835
And you're Huskarla.

369
00:35:04,315 --> 00:35:06,315
That's an order.

370
00:35:07,275 --> 00:35:09,275
You'll never be forgotten, Gil.

371
00:35:12,715 --> 00:35:14,715
Get out of here, go. Go!

372
00:35:16,835 --> 00:35:18,275
Vishka, help.

373
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:21,075
Come on, Slean.

374
00:35:34,395 --> 00:35:36,991
Now, you think if Slean
got killed on this bridge

375
00:35:37,016 --> 00:35:39,275
any of us would be remembered
in any song?

376
00:35:39,315 --> 00:35:40,715
Huh?

377
00:35:43,555 --> 00:35:45,115
To your positions.

378
00:35:47,595 --> 00:35:48,875
Come on!

379
00:35:51,675 --> 00:35:53,675
Who wants to die first?

380
00:36:00,076 --> 00:36:02,116
The bloodright has been invoked.

381
00:36:02,156 --> 00:36:05,076
Two men, brothers.

382
00:36:05,116 --> 00:36:07,996
One man lives. No weapons.

383
00:36:09,276 --> 00:36:12,156
If that man is you, you
may have your favour.

384
00:36:13,356 --> 00:36:14,636
Begin!

385
00:36:16,916 --> 00:36:20,156
Our mother should have left you
on the plains for the crows to eat.

386
00:36:28,796 --> 00:36:30,436
Left, right...

387
00:36:35,716 --> 00:36:37,076
Get up!

388
00:36:39,356 --> 00:36:40,596
More!

389
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:52,716
Argh!

390
00:37:09,996 --> 00:37:12,676
Read this message... from Rheda.

391
00:37:12,716 --> 00:37:14,716
Read it? That's all?

392
00:37:19,636 --> 00:37:21,636
You should have said.

393
00:37:22,636 --> 00:37:24,636
I would still have my champion.

394
00:37:41,156 --> 00:37:44,476
Beowulf, leave my
land. Go back to your people.

395
00:37:44,516 --> 00:37:46,316
That's it?

396
00:37:47,676 --> 00:37:49,676
You call yourself a warrior?

397
00:37:52,076 --> 00:37:55,236
- Varr.
- Oh, no. Varr stays here.

398
00:37:56,876 --> 00:38:00,676
The man who wins... doesn't
just take a life.

399
00:38:01,996 --> 00:38:04,676
He takes responsibility for
the dead man's family.

400
00:38:05,996 --> 00:38:07,996
Therefore I must stay.

401
00:38:10,196 --> 00:38:12,036
You can't stay here.

402
00:38:12,076 --> 00:38:13,676
I must.

403
00:38:14,716 --> 00:38:18,316
Perhaps I'll enjoy life
more here second time around.

404
00:38:21,236 --> 00:38:23,236
You won't change your mind?

405
00:38:24,356 --> 00:38:28,036
I have no choice. I've
nobody to go back for.

406
00:38:28,076 --> 00:38:29,476
Unlike you.

407
00:38:35,836 --> 00:38:38,236
The message. What was in it?

408
00:38:39,596 --> 00:38:41,476
It doesn't matter now.

409
00:38:45,436 --> 00:38:47,036
Goodbye, Beowulf.

410
00:38:47,916 --> 00:38:51,316
Tell Rheda I... failed her.

411
00:39:07,276 --> 00:39:09,116
Varr knew.

412
00:39:09,796 --> 00:39:13,076
He's condemned
himself to a life he despises.

413
00:39:13,116 --> 00:39:15,116
For nothing.

414
00:39:16,476 --> 00:39:18,476
Rate did exactly what you said he would.

415
00:39:19,396 --> 00:39:21,916
He burned your
message, told me to go home.

416
00:39:21,956 --> 00:39:23,956
That this battle was
not the Varni's fight.

417
00:39:25,076 --> 00:39:27,476
So now our only hope is Slean.

418
00:39:29,836 --> 00:39:31,836
He's at the Draca bridge.

419
00:39:33,636 --> 00:39:36,836
If he can hold it long enough the
Banning might get here in time.

420
00:39:39,516 --> 00:39:42,716
He'll die a hero instead of a traitor.

421
00:39:54,276 --> 00:39:56,396
What defences we have are ready.

422
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:58,436
And so are the people.

423
00:40:00,316 --> 00:40:01,916
Slean's here.

424
00:40:27,556 --> 00:40:29,156
I bought you a day...

425
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:33,596
in the hope that the
Banning will come and fight with us.

426
00:40:46,836 --> 00:40:48,836
Do you think that's enough?

427
00:40:51,596 --> 00:40:53,556
You betrayed me.

428
00:40:55,236 --> 00:40:57,236
You betrayed your people.

429
00:40:59,876 --> 00:41:03,796
You may fight with them if you
wish, but... you will never lead.

430
00:41:06,116 --> 00:41:08,116
You're not my son.

431
00:41:26,036 --> 00:41:27,396
Advance!

432
00:41:54,236 --> 00:41:56,236
Let's make camp here.

433
00:41:57,596 --> 00:41:59,316
Rest.

434
00:42:00,516 --> 00:42:02,516
We'll attack at first light.

435
00:42:04,636 --> 00:42:06,636
And tomorrow...

436
00:42:07,916 --> 00:42:09,916
Herot is ours.

437
00:42:16,676 --> 00:42:18,528
And tomorrow... you will hunt

438
00:42:18,553 --> 00:42:20,660
down Beowulf and avenge Jogan.

439
00:42:21,996 --> 00:42:23,996
Jogan was my brother.

440
00:42:25,356 --> 00:42:27,516
And Beowulf will die by my blade.

441
00:42:28,636 --> 00:42:30,636
I swear it.

442
00:42:31,796 --> 00:42:35,956
On the bones of the
restless dead, I swear it.

443
00:42:37,196 --> 00:42:42,356
His Thane, Herot, everyone
and everything in it.

444
00:42:43,636 --> 00:42:46,276
All that he holds precious to him...

445
00:42:47,876 --> 00:42:49,876
shall burn.

446
00:42:54,036 --> 00:42:57,836
We're not fighting today for
the iron they smelt in the pits.

447
00:42:59,236 --> 00:43:01,716
We're not fighting for
a Thane or a Jarl.

448
00:43:03,196 --> 00:43:06,436
We're not fighting for the gold
on the walls in Rheda's hall.

449
00:43:09,076 --> 00:43:11,076
We're fighting for family.

450
00:43:11,116 --> 00:43:13,116
We're fighting for friends.

451
00:43:13,156 --> 00:43:15,156
Come on!

452
00:43:16,396 --> 00:43:18,396
For those we care for.

453
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:21,956
For those old piece
of dirt we call home.

454
00:43:23,636 --> 00:43:25,396
For Herot!
