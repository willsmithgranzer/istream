1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,040
- There's no turning you, is there?
- No.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,760
Then I'll take you as you are.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,680
You, my friend, don't know who I am.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,840
Never come back to
Herot. You're dead to me.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,760
Play the part your
mother has set for you.

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,239
She'll not be expecting when
we take power from her.

7
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,040
Do you want to be Thane?

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,800
Tell my uncle I am done with him.

9
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,040
You have hid in the
shadows for too long.

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,880
If you want power, take it.

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,840
If I tell my mother the
truth, I'll lose her trust.

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,439
And with it, any chance of ever ruling.

13
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,720
But if Abrecan
attacks, Herot could fall.

14
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,240
I have a vision for
us... to be the greatest tribe.

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,400
Abrecan is going to attack Herot.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,074

I won't let anyone hurt you.

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,040
Ever again.

20
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,601
Abrecan would never betray me.

21
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,080
I speak only the truth.

22
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,360
I heard him call for his
people to attack Herot.

23
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,280
He's building an army.

24
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,680
This man is a thief and a murderer.

25
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,160
I believe him.

26
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,560
Our enemy are the Warig. This
prophet Razzak, not my brother.

27
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,440
Ready my horse.

28
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,080
You come to me and tell
me that Abrecan is a traitor?

29
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,040
Well, I will ask him to his face.

30
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,040
Rheda, you can't!

31
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,120
Wait!

32
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,400
Beowulf has told your
mother of Abrecan's betrayal.

33
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,480
How does he know?

34
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,400
Does it matter? She's
about to ride to Bregan.

35
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,000
I have to go.

36
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,680
I have to tell her.

37
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,920
That it was you that made her believe
the Varni was Herot's enemy,

38
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,040
plotted with Abrecan to overthrow her?

39
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,240
No, she can't go.

40
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,360
If she doesn't come back...

41
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,400
you will be Thane.

42
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,120
Rheda, you can't go to Bregan.

43
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,560
If it's true and Abrecan is a traitor,

44
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,280
then you're riding straight
into the arms of your enemy.

45
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,320
You're speaking of my brother.

46
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,120
- Let me take your place.
- No.

47
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,320
At least take an
escort of Slean's Huskarla.

48
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,600
The men are needed here
should the Warig attack.

49
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,200
- Now step aside, both of you.
- Mother.

50
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,960
Prepare the people to fight our
real enemy, the Mudborn. Go!

51
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,120
Abrecan won't harm her.

52
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:23,240
Whatever he's done or he's
planning, he would never harm his sister.

53
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,280
Let's hope you're right.

54
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,760
I see a land.

55
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:38,480
A land where the Mudborn roam freely

56
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:46,280
amongst the broken stones and empty
halls that were once our homes.

57
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,480
Where we are no more than a memory.

58
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,600
Like the giants that
ruled here before us.

59
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,480
This is our future.

60
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,960
Unless we are strong.

61
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,160
Some doubted that I cared
for the people of Bregan.

62
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,480
My people doubted
me... their rightful Thane.

63
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,520
I was once taught that a
good man forgives those

64
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,960
with the courage to
admit they are at fault.

65
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,760
With the courage to
ask for that forgiveness.

66
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,720
I also taught you that a good
man should have the courage

67
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,840
to stand by what he believes.

68
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,600
Your plans to attack your
own sister offend me.

69
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,760
Thank you for teaching
me this last lesson.

70
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:07,320
That a good man and a good
leader are not the same.

71
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Argh!

72
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:32,160
If the Shieldlands are to
remain, we must be strong!

73
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,640
And I must be Jarl!

74
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,480
Greetings, Skellen, Warfather
of the Wulfing.

75
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,280
I have a proposition for you
from Abrecan, Bregan's Thane.

76
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,640
Further to the one the
Wulfing boy delivered.

77
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,240
It's one you'll want to
hear rather than kill me.

78
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,440
Good work.

79
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,760
Your sister will
hear what you're planning.

80
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,720
I know. And she will come.

81
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,560
When she does, will you string
her up alongside Harken?

82
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:57,760
You were the one who said, "Be bold."

83
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,080
You spent time in Bregan.

84
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,480
How many warriors can they
field if Abrecan wages war?

85
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,040
No more than 50. But
they're no match for ours.

86
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,320
And the Huskarla
are training the people.

87
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,040
Every person who can lift a sword.

88
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,840
Apart from the smelters. They
don't appreciate being told what to do.

89
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,880
Maybe not by the Huskarla.

90
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,880
Leave them to to me.

91
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:42,400
If there is war, all our
people must be ready to fight.

92
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,560
Right! You are all here to learn
to fight like Huskarla.

93
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,640
You townspeople are going to
fight with us to protect Herot.

94
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,440
Lila, you're with me.

95
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:12,040
Everybody, grab
yourselves a weapon. Let's go!

96
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,520
What kind of favour is this?

97
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,520
Well, if you're right about Abrecan,

98
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,840
we're going to need all
the help we can get.

99
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,600
So the favour... teach
them to fight. Fight dirty.

100
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,640
Smelters!

101
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,640
Like you, they ignore authority.

102
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,840
That's why you're gonna teach them.

103
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,080
This is Breca.

104
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,280
Some of you know him.

105
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,480
Some of you are owed money by him.

106
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,520
He's here to share a
few things with you.

107
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,800
Wait. Beowulf...

108
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:17,000
Come on! Sweat,
blister, bleed if you have to!

109
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,600
It's not Herot or a
Thane you'll be fighting for

110
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,440
when those Mudborn break
through those walls.

111
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,040
When they're in here among us,

112
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:29,600
you'll be all that stands
between those you love and the Warig.

113
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,960
Stand strong together and we shall win!

114
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,720
Right, you heard him! Back to it.

115
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,400
Rargh!

116
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,440
Wood splinters.

117
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,880
It's no good to
you, not in a real fight.

118
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,280
Iron.

119
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,480
This is the perfect weapon.

120
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:09,400
And it won't just kill a
man, it'll bury him too.

121
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,440
Better.

122
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,200
Better.

123
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,680
- Bah!
- Don't tell me you're not tempted.

124
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,000
You strike first, you
live. You don't, you die.

125
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,160
See, I told
you. Let them come at you.

126
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,480
If you're running at
them, you're not thinking.

127
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,120
If you're not
thinking, bad things happen.

128
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,760
Yah!

129
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,120
Harder!

130
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,400
Gil, the troll is hungry!

131
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,200
I told you, you have to clear out.

132
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,280
We have to bring the troll back,
it should have been fed hours ago.

133
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,360
When we're done. They
could do with a break.

134
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,560
Clear out, now!

135
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,040
- Have you ever seen an angry troll?
- I'm looking at one.

136
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,760
- Gil!
- It needs its salt!

137
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,800
Back down.

138
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,640
Breca!

139
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,680
Argh!

140
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,040
He's dead.

141
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,360
You see?

142
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,440
It was only a matter of time
before the Mudborn killed somebody.

143
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,240
It's killed a human. It's
angry, it could kill again.

144
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,120
We have to hunt it down.

145
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,320
Gil, go with him.

146
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,600
You, get back in there.

147
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,400
Everybody back to your training.

148
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,760
I'll come.

149
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,160
All right.

150
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,480
Don't let him kill it.

151
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,920
Bring it back alive.

152
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,240
What are you doing?

153
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:24,120
Elvina's gone, I thought I would erm...

154
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,200
I'm being insensitive.

155
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:32,040
Of course...

156
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,720
you cared for her deeply.

157
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,280
I loved her.

158
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,520
It must have been hard for you,

159
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,800
to see her so happy...

160
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,080
with Beowulf.

161
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,520
But we must be
practical. Herot needs a Healer.

162
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:58,000
Never more than at this time, when
we have enemies on all sides.

163
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,680
You think you can replace her?

164
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,840
Replace her?

165
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,080
No, I just want to help.

166
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,680
I'm not seeking your
permission to do this,

167
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,080
but I'd rather it
was with your blessing.

168
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,760
All right. Just don't poison anyone.

169
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,359
Elvina.

170
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,640
Beowulf said...

171
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,680
Said what?

172
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,640
That you were dead.

173
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,640
I'm sorry, I...

174
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,280
Does Slean know you're alive?

175
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,760
Kela, whatever was between Slean
and me, it's in the past.

176
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,360
You've nothing to fear from me.

177
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,240
Perhaps you could help me?

178
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,520
- What are you making?
- It's for the treating of wounds.

179
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,480
- Is that wormwood?
- The healer in Mere used it.

180
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,560
Yes. And celladine?

181
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,600
Yes.

182
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,920
I'd like it if we could be friends.

183
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,960
Aren't we?

184
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,560
Of course.

185
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:38,560
What you're using won't seal the wound,
but this will numb the pain.

186
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,320
Beowulf said the Warig killed you.

187
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,920
I escaped through the forest.

188
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,200
Kela.

189
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,240
You're telling me to leave?

190
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,280
Please.

191
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,560
Beowulf knows the truth.

192
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,600
What truth?

193
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,640
He knows what I am.

194
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,680
You told him?

195
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,280
He saw. I had no choice, it
was that or let him die.

196
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,880
A skinshifter saved his
life. He must have choked on that.

197
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,360
I won't let him harm you.

198
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,800
I won't.

199
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,840
Sister, this is an unexpected pleasure.

200
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:55,240
It has been too long since
you have been home.

201
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,840
I'm not here for pleasure.

202
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,440
I've been hearing things.

203
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,600
About Bregan.

204
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,800
About you.

205
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,400
Rumours.

206
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:24,960
Why does the body of one of
Bregan's most loyal and wise councillors

207
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,840
hang at the city walls?

208
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,640
- Rheda.
- Saray.

209
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:40,120
You must be tired after your journey.
Let me take you to wash.

210
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:44,120
Thank you, Saray, but I
need to speak with my brother.

211
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,560
Leave us.

212
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,160
Of course.

213
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,320
Run.

214
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,240
Maybe Kendra has a point.

215
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:20,440
The troll does the work of 20
men... men who could be preparing to fight.

216
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,160
We could take it back alive.

217
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,880
It killed a man.

218
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,640
The Mudborn have no place among us.

219
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,760
I only asked.

220
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,600
Like you said, it killed
because it was hungry, frightened.

221
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,560
We know the reason it
acted the way it did.

222
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,800
No! They don't reason. They just hate.

223
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,400
That's why the Warig
killed the Huskarla in the forest,

224
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,160
that's why the troll killed today.

225
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,360
Even if that were true,
where does hating them back get us?

226
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,840
With a little sense, to the point where

227
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,880
we find every one of
them and cut their throats.

228
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,320
Right, Beowulf, you understand.

229
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,480
Mudborn scum have
killed people I care about.

230
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,400
There are two sets of tracks
here. Gil, take Vishka.

231
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,080
Boy! Bring us some more firewood.

232
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,160
Firewood is hard to come
by here at the coast.

233
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:03,040
So your gift of the
pillar was most welcome.

234
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,560
Those laws were meant to unite us.

235
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,720
So they will... in warmth.

236
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,880
You forget yourself.

237
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:17,360
Not only am I your
sister, I am also your Jarl.

238
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,400
Oh, yes, so you are.

239
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,440
For today.

240
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,400
And who will be Jarl tomorrow, you?

241
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:17,400
If you're going to end
my life, do it now.

242
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,040
I never wanted to harm you.

243
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,680
Things would have gone a
lot easier for me if I had.

244
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:33,920
A ship leaves for the
Farlands on the next tide.

245
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,640
Give me what I want
and you will sail with it.

246
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,760
Refuse...

247
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,320
Beowulf, no!

248
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:45,200
Look, it's calmer. Let's take it back.

249
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,000
It doesn't belong
here. Please don't kill it.

250
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,560
Beowulf, he's gonna kill it!

251
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:28,000
Hey! Yaaaaargh!

252
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,280
- What's that?
- A decree.

253
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,120
Stating you relinquish your claim

254
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,880
to be both Jarl of the
Shieldlands and Thane of Herot.

255
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,680
Huh.

256
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,840
Even if I sign,

257
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,120
you need the other Thanes to
vote for you at a Gathering.

258
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:17,400
You threw Rate out. And
the others I can deal with.

259
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,200
And what is your
answer? Will you sign it?

260
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,600
I would never do that to my son.

261
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,560
Of course, your son.

262
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,160
Even without knowing
it, you prove I'm right

263
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,240
that you are the wrong
choice to lead us.

264
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,080
Because I care for my family?

265
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,680
Because you let your
heart rule your head.

266
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,840
Your son, your wonderful, loyal son,

267
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,560
he was the one who laid the
false blame on the Varni,

268
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,600
even though he knew it was
I who moved against you.

269
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,880
You're lying. Slean would never do that.

270
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:57,360
Just as he'd never have told my
men not to light the warning pyre

271
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,400
to alert Herot of the Wulfing raid?

272
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,200
You have no idea, do you?

273
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:11,240
You have absolutely no idea
what it's like to be related to you.

274
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,120
Sign, or I will do what must be done.

275
00:31:00,002 --> 00:31:02,322
Thank you for bringing it back alive.

276
00:31:02,362 --> 00:31:04,362
Thank Vishka.

277
00:31:15,442 --> 00:31:17,962
- What are you doing here?
- I'm not gonna let you hurt her.

278
00:31:18,002 --> 00:31:21,362
- Stay out of this, Slean.
- You think I don't know?

279
00:31:24,362 --> 00:31:26,482
How long have you
known she was a skinshifter?

280
00:31:26,522 --> 00:31:32,402
Years. It's never
made a difference to me.

281
00:31:34,042 --> 00:31:36,762
We need to talk. The three of us.

282
00:31:49,122 --> 00:31:53,002
You knew she was a skinshifter? You
put everyone in Herot at risk.

283
00:31:53,042 --> 00:31:56,482
- She's no threat.
- I saw what she did to the Warig.

284
00:31:56,522 --> 00:31:58,682
Which she did to save your life.

285
00:31:58,722 --> 00:32:01,282
I'm a healer. I help
people, I don't harm them.

286
00:32:01,322 --> 00:32:03,002
You think they'll care?

287
00:32:03,042 --> 00:32:05,682
You saw what they did to
the skinshifter they found here.

288
00:32:05,722 --> 00:32:08,322
They'll just drag you out
into the street and finish you.

289
00:32:08,362 --> 00:32:10,282
- I won't let them.
- You won't have a choice.

290
00:32:10,322 --> 00:32:14,442
Thane's son or not. It was an
open secret that she was your woman.

291
00:32:14,482 --> 00:32:17,322
She's a skinshifter, she
can take care of herself.

292
00:32:17,362 --> 00:32:20,042
But you... they'll have your life.

293
00:32:20,082 --> 00:32:23,202
That's the law, that's what they
do to those who lie with the Mudborn.

294
00:32:23,242 --> 00:32:26,282
Who's gonna tell them? You?

295
00:32:26,322 --> 00:32:30,922
You do that and I will make
sure you are cut down with us.

296
00:32:34,442 --> 00:32:36,442
Why did you come back?

297
00:32:36,482 --> 00:32:39,482
Because this is my home.

298
00:32:39,522 --> 00:32:42,962
You, as much as
anyone, know what that means.

299
00:32:47,442 --> 00:32:49,442
Stay if you wish.

300
00:32:49,482 --> 00:32:51,482
But this is on you.

301
00:33:04,802 --> 00:33:09,082
Rheda would die before
she yields, you know that.

302
00:33:09,122 --> 00:33:12,042
She has your strength.

303
00:33:14,122 --> 00:33:17,282
You said you would stand by me.

304
00:33:17,322 --> 00:33:20,562
This is not standing by me!

305
00:33:22,722 --> 00:33:24,762
I have given her her chance.

306
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:27,042
A sister's blood will not wash away.

307
00:33:27,082 --> 00:33:31,802
Then I will wear it with honour.

308
00:33:31,842 --> 00:33:35,122
As I will have spilt it for my people.

309
00:33:39,362 --> 00:33:42,282
We must prepare for what is coming.

310
00:33:42,322 --> 00:33:44,322
You're burning up. Your wound...

311
00:34:03,362 --> 00:34:05,722
You saved me from my darkness.

312
00:34:05,762 --> 00:34:09,522
I will not stand by and let
that same darkness take you.

313
00:34:09,562 --> 00:34:11,562
Let your sister go.

314
00:34:17,002 --> 00:34:21,161
If you love me,

315
00:34:21,202 --> 00:34:25,482
if you ever loved me, let her go.

316
00:34:30,842 --> 00:34:36,121
You are nothing. A body
to warm my bed with.

317
00:34:36,161 --> 00:34:38,161
Abrecan?

318
00:34:40,882 --> 00:34:44,002
What's he doing here? I
thought you sent him away.

319
00:34:44,042 --> 00:34:46,042
Well?

320
00:34:46,081 --> 00:34:48,922
Their flags unfurl and
their sails catch the wind.

321
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:51,042
They will be here before nightfall.

322
00:34:51,081 --> 00:34:53,962
They agreed to your terms.

323
00:34:56,842 --> 00:34:58,842
You have done well.

324
00:35:03,482 --> 00:35:05,482
Who will be here by nightfall?

325
00:35:08,842 --> 00:35:11,282
What have you done?

326
00:35:11,322 --> 00:35:13,322
Leave.

327
00:35:15,642 --> 00:35:17,642
Now.

328
00:35:19,682 --> 00:35:23,602
If I require your
services, I will send for you.

329
00:35:23,642 --> 00:35:27,002
As you will.

330
00:35:41,962 --> 00:35:44,562
Bring me my sister!

331
00:36:06,802 --> 00:36:08,802
Leave us.

332
00:36:16,162 --> 00:36:18,362
I've considered
everything you've had to say.

333
00:36:34,882 --> 00:36:36,882
That is your answer, then.

334
00:36:40,602 --> 00:36:42,602
It is.

335
00:36:47,562 --> 00:36:49,562
I won't enjoy this.

336
00:36:49,602 --> 00:36:54,282
What happened to you? What had to.

337
00:36:55,762 --> 00:36:57,762
Argh!

338
00:37:08,962 --> 00:37:11,202
I am glad you put up a fight.

339
00:37:18,162 --> 00:37:21,602
He's alive. We don't have long.

340
00:37:44,802 --> 00:37:46,802
Follow me.

341
00:37:54,082 --> 00:37:56,082
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

342
00:38:00,442 --> 00:38:02,322
- You go.
- What about you?

343
00:38:02,362 --> 00:38:05,922
- I'll follow.
- If they catch you...

344
00:38:05,962 --> 00:38:09,162
Saray, he is beyond saving.

345
00:38:09,202 --> 00:38:12,322
But you're not and Herot needs you.

346
00:38:14,842 --> 00:38:16,962
- Over there! Stop her!
- Go!

347
00:38:57,362 --> 00:38:59,362
Yaaah!

348
00:39:26,802 --> 00:39:28,762
She got away.

349
00:39:28,802 --> 00:39:30,802
It doesn't matter.

350
00:39:33,202 --> 00:39:37,802
Soon, 200 Wulfing
warriors will be ashore.

351
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:40,122
You've allied yourself to the Wulfing?

352
00:39:40,162 --> 00:39:43,242
They'll plunder Herot and then
sail back across the Whale Road.

353
00:39:43,282 --> 00:39:46,122
They won't just plunder, they'll kill.

354
00:39:46,162 --> 00:39:47,882
A few lives, some gold.

355
00:39:47,922 --> 00:39:50,802
A small price to pay compared
to what they'll get in return.

356
00:39:52,922 --> 00:39:58,482
A leader who can save the Shieldlands.

357
00:39:58,522 --> 00:40:02,162
I should have taken your
life the night we met.

358
00:40:17,802 --> 00:40:20,162
And to think I almost left with you.

359
00:40:25,202 --> 00:40:29,562
I came this close to missing
what fate has in store to me.

360
00:41:45,282 --> 00:41:48,762
See that her body is
burned with the other traitors.

361
00:41:48,802 --> 00:41:52,202
After that, there will be
time enough or me to rest...

362
00:41:52,242 --> 00:41:54,642
in Herot's Golden Hall.

363
00:41:54,682 --> 00:41:59,882
Once the Wulfing dogs
have landed on our shores.

364
00:42:18,122 --> 00:42:19,802
Stop.

365
00:42:19,842 --> 00:42:22,882
My brother has betrayed
us. All because of my son.

366
00:42:22,922 --> 00:42:25,402
He has allied Bregan with the Wulfings.

367
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:27,362
And now an army marches on Herot.

368
00:42:27,402 --> 00:42:29,442
At the Draca Bridge,
with a dozen Huskarla,

369
00:42:29,482 --> 00:42:31,842
we might be able to hold
them off for at least a day.

370
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:34,322
This could be Herot's only chance.

371
00:42:34,362 --> 00:42:38,122
You must send word to the Varni.
I banished them from the Alliance.

372
00:42:38,162 --> 00:42:41,762
Any messenger I send to Rate will
be sent back to us in pieces.

373
00:42:41,802 --> 00:42:43,762
For glory!

374
00:42:43,802 --> 00:42:45,922
Slean has gone
to stop the Wulfings.

375
00:42:45,962 --> 00:42:48,722
He and his Huskarla will buy
you the time for help to reach us.

376
00:42:48,762 --> 00:42:50,762
And he will not come back alive.

377
00:42:50,802 --> 00:42:53,682
But he will die with honour.

378
00:42:53,722 --> 00:42:54,751
Charge!

379
00:42:54,752 --> 00:42:56,912
