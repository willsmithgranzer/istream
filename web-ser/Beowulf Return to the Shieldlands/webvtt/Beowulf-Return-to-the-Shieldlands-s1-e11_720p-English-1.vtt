WEBVTT

00:01.960 --> 00:04.880
I heard him call for his
people to attack Herot.

00:04.920 --> 00:07.360
Beowulf has told your
mother of Abrecan's betrayal.

00:07.400 --> 00:09.160
She's about to ride to Bregan.

00:09.200 --> 00:11.320
- Let me take your place.
- Step aside!

00:11.360 --> 00:14.040
Whatever he's done, Abrecan
won't harm her.

00:14.080 --> 00:18.040
I have a proposition for you
from Abrecan, Bregan's Thane.

00:18.080 --> 00:22.000
Soon 200 Wulfing
warriors will be ashore.

00:22.040 --> 00:24.120
They won't just plunder, they'll kill.

00:24.160 --> 00:27.960
Not only am I your
sister, I am also your Jarl.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.080
For today. A decree stating
you'll relinquish your claim

00:31.120 --> 00:33.760
to be both Jarl of the
Shieldlands and Thane of Herot.

00:33.800 --> 00:36.320
I would never do that to my son.

00:36.360 --> 00:40.720
Of course, your son. He was the one
who laid the false blame on the Varni

00:40.760 --> 00:43.600
even though he knew it was
I who moved against you.

00:46.480 --> 00:50.080
- He is beyond saving.
- But you're not. And Herot needs you.

Destroy them!

01:35.360 --> 01:39.120
For glory!

01:39.160 --> 01:41.840
Charge!

02:56.480 --> 03:00.920
With that at your side, who
could stand in your way?

03:12.400 --> 03:13.800
Skellan.

03:15.040 --> 03:18.040
Warfather of the Wulfing clans.

03:18.080 --> 03:20.445
Your man here promised us all the

03:20.470 --> 03:22.880
gold and iron my men could carry.

03:22.920 --> 03:24.320
You'll have more.

03:25.400 --> 03:28.760
But first, I must have your oath...

03:30.560 --> 03:34.720
..that you and your men will
follow my leadership.

03:34.760 --> 03:38.440
We'll do what we want.
That is the Wulfing way...

03:38.480 --> 03:41.640
Hold... your tongue.

03:47.920 --> 03:49.480
You have my oath.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.400
Then Herot will fall.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.480
In case we're attacked, we
need Huskarla at every gatepost.

04:20.440 --> 04:24.040
Each in command of at least five
men, be they townsfolk or smelters.

04:24.680 --> 04:28.080
And post sentries on each
of the five surrounding hills.

04:32.560 --> 04:35.040
And they need to be
able to see over the hori...

04:36.280 --> 04:37.600
Mother.

04:42.640 --> 04:44.200
Rheda, stop.

04:44.680 --> 04:47.240
- What's going on?
- Lock him up.

04:48.280 --> 04:49.560
Now!

04:53.040 --> 04:55.040
I need good reason.

04:57.520 --> 05:00.800
My brother has betrayed us.

05:02.360 --> 05:05.000
He has allied Bregan with the Wulfings

05:05.040 --> 05:08.320
and now an army marches on
Herot all because of my son.

05:09.640 --> 05:11.640
Take his father's sword.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.200
Is this true?

05:21.240 --> 05:22.840
A traitor...

05:24.320 --> 05:26.040
in league with traitors.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
I said, lock him up!

05:52.360 --> 05:54.784
An army marches on us, to seize

05:54.809 --> 05:57.520
our homes and steal our freedom.

05:57.560 --> 05:58.960
Why do you stand there?

05:59.600 --> 06:01.360
Come on, move!

06:04.840 --> 06:06.360
Abrecan was behind all this?

06:06.880 --> 06:09.640
Scorann's death? Bayen's murder?

06:11.440 --> 06:13.320
And he did it all with Slean's help?

06:16.280 --> 06:17.320
Beowulf.

06:18.840 --> 06:20.840
The Wulfing ships line our shores.

06:20.880 --> 06:24.400
Send riders to the Mere,
the Banning, the Wisdeth.

06:24.440 --> 06:26.840
Tell them Herot is under attack.

06:26.880 --> 06:30.480
Tell them to send their men.
We need them to stand with us.

06:30.520 --> 06:32.840
You must send word to the Varni.

06:32.880 --> 06:34.880
No, no, no.

06:34.920 --> 06:37.280
The other tribes won't make it in time.

06:38.400 --> 06:40.102
The Varni are closer. And the Varni

06:40.127 --> 06:41.520
aren't farmers or fishermen.

06:41.560 --> 06:43.560
You'd have me send to Rate?

06:44.440 --> 06:46.520
Have you lost your wits?

06:48.160 --> 06:50.160
I expelled him from this hall.

06:51.080 --> 06:53.640
I banished them from the alliance.

06:58.440 --> 07:00.440
Well, tell them you were mistaken.

07:00.480 --> 07:02.059
Don't let your people die because you

07:02.084 --> 07:03.680
are too proud to admit you are wrong!

07:03.720 --> 07:05.200
It's pointless!

07:05.960 --> 07:10.160
Any messenger I send to Rate will
be sent back to us in pieces.

07:12.520 --> 07:14.360
Then I'll go.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.200
I'm the only one he'll listen to.

07:17.240 --> 07:20.000
- I need you here.
- The defences are in hand.

07:20.640 --> 07:22.349
One man riding hard and fast, I can

07:22.374 --> 07:24.200
be back before the Wulfings get here.

07:24.240 --> 07:25.840
Two men.

07:26.840 --> 07:29.320
I am Varni, after
all. I know their ways.

07:29.360 --> 07:32.080
We would at least stand a
chance against Abrecan's army.

07:37.960 --> 07:39.960
I'll lead them to Herot.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Go. Do as I have asked.

07:42.040 --> 07:44.560
- And then?
- Return to Bregan.

07:44.600 --> 07:46.600
You're needed there.

07:46.640 --> 07:50.640
The next time we meet... you'll be Jarl.

07:51.480 --> 07:52.880
Until Herot.

07:58.760 --> 08:00.120
So...

08:01.280 --> 08:03.720
We follow the river until the pass.

08:03.760 --> 08:05.840
And then head for the Draca bridge.

08:06.680 --> 08:09.400
We'll scout the way first and
then the army will follow.

08:09.920 --> 08:12.480
The bridge is the quickest
route but they'll know that.

08:12.520 --> 08:14.760
We should take the
forests. Surprise them.

08:14.800 --> 08:18.120
No. The forest is full of Barghest.

08:19.400 --> 08:22.480
And are the men of
Bregan afraid of beasts?

08:25.280 --> 08:27.160
The men of Bregan had you on your knees.

08:27.200 --> 08:29.063
They could have
spilled your guts onto the

08:29.088 --> 08:30.840
sand and left you for the crabs to eat.

08:30.880 --> 08:32.200
Don't you forget it.

08:36.880 --> 08:39.960
- We take the bridge.
- We take the bridge.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Get the dogs.

08:47.480 --> 08:49.320
He should learn some manners.

08:49.360 --> 08:52.280
Why? He's a Wulfing.

09:05.680 --> 09:06.800
Good work, lads.

09:07.680 --> 09:10.320
Abrecan and his Wulfing
army will be here soon enough.

09:10.360 --> 09:12.360
So let's be ready for them.

09:12.400 --> 09:14.280
And back! Come on!

09:14.320 --> 09:16.720
The Wulfings won't care if you're tired!

09:21.760 --> 09:24.160
Come on! Put your backs in it!

09:35.920 --> 09:37.920
My son.

09:40.160 --> 09:42.160
I have something to give you.

09:51.840 --> 09:53.680
There.

09:54.160 --> 09:57.400
Don't measure yourself by me.

09:58.800 --> 10:00.800
You'll always be less.

10:09.520 --> 10:13.480
If you're here to say I
disappoint you, join the queue.

10:13.520 --> 10:15.560
You'll find I'm just at the front.

10:16.840 --> 10:20.240
And my mother. And Beowulf.

10:21.640 --> 10:23.640
And the rest of Herot.

10:25.760 --> 10:28.000
You never judged me.
How could I judge you?

10:56.120 --> 10:58.120
I slandered Rate...

10:58.160 --> 10:59.720
banished the Varni.

11:00.200 --> 11:02.200
And now they're our only hope.

11:04.920 --> 11:08.240
Beowulf can appeal to his sense
of honour, but he won't forgive.

11:12.440 --> 11:15.920
If he won't listen, give him this.

11:32.880 --> 11:35.040
Only if all else fails.

11:44.240 --> 11:46.720
Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.

11:48.360 --> 11:50.120
I'm surprised you're still here.

11:50.160 --> 11:52.720
- So am I.
- Why are you still with us?

11:52.760 --> 11:54.765
I thought it would be nice if the gates

11:54.790 --> 11:56.920
are finished before
the Wulfing get here.

11:56.960 --> 11:58.800
Lila's working on them.

11:58.840 --> 12:01.000
So you could help. Talk to her.

12:02.200 --> 12:05.920
The way I see it, chances are we're
all dead tomorrow in any case,

12:05.960 --> 12:08.120
so why have awkward conversations?

12:08.160 --> 12:10.120
If you're dead tomorrow, why not?

12:49.875 --> 12:51.435
You shouldn't be in here.

12:51.915 --> 12:53.915
Neither should you.

13:04.955 --> 13:06.955
It's not the marriage I dreamed of.

13:08.195 --> 13:10.195
Living a lie, sleeping alone.

13:10.235 --> 13:11.835
Now this.

13:13.075 --> 13:15.795
Perhaps you got
yourself put in here on purpose.

13:16.555 --> 13:18.595
Some men don't like commitment.

13:21.995 --> 13:23.995
You can't help me, Kela.

13:25.835 --> 13:28.075
Even if I was free, the
Wulfings are coming.

13:28.875 --> 13:32.155
Our allies won't make it in time.
There is nothing that can be done.

13:32.195 --> 13:34.315
There's always something.

13:34.355 --> 13:36.355
And I won't let you give up.

13:50.875 --> 13:52.875
Find me Gil of the Huskarla.

13:53.955 --> 13:55.755
Bring him to me.

14:07.475 --> 14:08.595
I said no.

14:08.635 --> 14:10.995
Slean would do anything for
the Huskarla, you know that.

14:11.035 --> 14:13.315
Do I? Do you? He betrayed us all.

14:13.355 --> 14:16.395
Stand and face me. I'm
your Thane's daughter by law!

14:17.635 --> 14:19.635
My husband was your commander.

14:21.435 --> 14:22.635
It's just a title.

14:22.675 --> 14:24.795
And do you think he wore it lightly?

14:24.835 --> 14:28.355
I was there when he washed the
body of your fallen comrade.

14:30.235 --> 14:32.235
Slean's scars were earned.

14:32.275 --> 14:35.315
In the same places as
yours, at your side.

14:37.435 --> 14:39.522
If Beowulf fails to convince the Varni

14:39.547 --> 14:41.419
to join us, we'll all die anyway.

14:43.635 --> 14:46.515
All he asks is that you
listen to what he has to say.

14:54.275 --> 14:58.235
Gil, I promise I knew
nothing about the Wulfing army.

15:02.195 --> 15:04.195
What do you want from me, Slean?

15:05.795 --> 15:07.595
Has Rheda sent word to our allies?

15:07.635 --> 15:08.955
Yes.

15:10.395 --> 15:12.395
They'll not be here in time, though.

15:12.435 --> 15:14.595
If we buy them the
time, the Banning might.

15:16.395 --> 15:17.475
How?

15:19.275 --> 15:20.675
Draca bridge.

15:21.715 --> 15:23.315
With a dozen Huskarla.

15:23.355 --> 15:25.955
We might be able to hold them
off for at least a day.

15:25.995 --> 15:28.715
That might be just enough
time for them to get here.

15:29.595 --> 15:33.995
Come on, Gil. The Huskarla's
job is to protect Herot.

15:34.635 --> 15:36.715
Even if it means dying for it.

15:37.795 --> 15:40.955
This could be Herot's only chance.

16:14.355 --> 16:16.795
If I'd known you planned to
die, I'd never have helped.

16:16.835 --> 16:18.635
Which is why I didn't tell you.

16:18.675 --> 16:21.595
Kela... thank you.

16:23.995 --> 16:25.595
What are you doing here, Vishka?

16:25.635 --> 16:27.915
Coming with you to the bridge.

16:27.955 --> 16:30.555
- No.
- You heard him.

16:30.595 --> 16:32.275
You know I can fight.

16:32.315 --> 16:33.835
Better than him, you said.

16:39.395 --> 16:40.795
All right.

16:47.595 --> 16:49.595
And you need
someone to look out for you.

16:51.075 --> 16:53.075
You tell Lila about this?

16:53.115 --> 16:56.435
- She'd only worry.
- You don't think she'd have a point?

17:05.635 --> 17:07.915
Well, this looks homely.

17:07.954 --> 17:10.635
The Varni prefer their
creature comforts dead.

17:10.675 --> 17:12.675
No wonder you left.

17:12.714 --> 17:15.115
And swore I'd never return.

17:18.755 --> 17:20.755
Leave the horses.

17:27.234 --> 17:29.795
On foot, we look less of a threat.

17:30.515 --> 17:32.515
On foot, we are less of a threat.

17:43.475 --> 17:45.475
How do we find Rate?

17:45.515 --> 17:47.515
He'll find us.

17:52.435 --> 17:53.715
Stand still.

17:53.755 --> 17:56.435
Varr. You piece of filth.

17:57.795 --> 18:01.395
It's good to see you, too.
Beowulf, you remember Argat?

18:02.355 --> 18:04.675
My only surviving half-brother.

18:06.075 --> 18:08.155
I'm not sensing much brotherly love.

18:15.235 --> 18:16.515
Beowulf.

18:17.715 --> 18:21.035
I promised the next time
we met, I'd kill you.

18:38.235 --> 18:40.395
I thought of it more as
a threat than a promise.

18:40.435 --> 18:42.435
You thought wrong, then.

18:45.035 --> 18:46.955
You've got rusty.

18:47.875 --> 18:49.275
I tripped.

18:49.915 --> 18:51.955
Right. The tent beat you.

18:53.115 --> 18:54.355
Exactly.

19:06.515 --> 19:09.515
Argat, get them water and
then bring them to my tent.

19:25.475 --> 19:28.355
They can't flank us, they can't pass us.

19:31.035 --> 19:33.035
They'll have to fight.

19:34.475 --> 19:37.475
And for as long as we hold
out, there's hope for our people.

19:40.475 --> 19:43.795
The middle of the bridge. That's
where we make our stand.

19:59.955 --> 20:01.635
Check the end of the bridge.

20:26.435 --> 20:27.755
All clear!

21:09.915 --> 21:11.715
Did you know?

21:16.075 --> 21:18.075
Know what?

21:20.755 --> 21:22.755
About my son's betrayal.

21:25.875 --> 21:27.195
Tell me.

21:29.875 --> 21:32.595
Do you think you can
choose to hold your tongue?

21:34.355 --> 21:37.275
- I am your Thane.
- And Slean is my husband.

21:39.115 --> 21:42.755
What sort of wife would I
be to turn on him so easily?

21:44.435 --> 21:46.355
The wife of a man in chains.

21:47.315 --> 21:50.395
And yet you send
messengers to beg my tribe to aid you.

21:57.595 --> 21:59.595
Then I will ask him myself.

22:00.235 --> 22:01.795
You'll find that hard.

22:03.355 --> 22:05.395
He is no longer in chains.

22:08.315 --> 22:10.995
Slean has gone to stop the
Wulfing, to cut them off.

22:12.155 --> 22:16.435
He and his Huskarla will buy
you the time for help to reach us.

22:18.195 --> 22:21.275
If Herot still stands
tomorrow it will be his doing.

22:22.235 --> 22:26.195
Where? Where has he gone?

22:29.715 --> 22:31.275
Draca bridge.

22:34.195 --> 22:36.275
And he will not come back alive.

22:38.435 --> 22:40.435
But he will die with honour.

22:46.635 --> 22:47.835
Charge!

22:53.555 --> 22:55.555
Reset!

22:57.355 --> 22:59.355
Hold!

23:00.755 --> 23:02.755
- Hold!
- Hey!

23:04.595 --> 23:06.915
Come on. Come here!

23:11.915 --> 23:13.035
Vishka!

23:19.155 --> 23:21.315
Grab my hand. Come on, get up.

23:22.075 --> 23:24.075
Hold my hand!

23:44.675 --> 23:46.675
Where are you?

24:04.995 --> 24:06.995
You must stay away from Herot.

24:09.275 --> 24:10.675
It's dangerous.

24:15.195 --> 24:16.955
You followed me.

24:16.995 --> 24:20.755
I followed him. I knew
he would lead me to you.

24:22.395 --> 24:24.075
Leave him alone.

24:24.115 --> 24:26.115
I mean neither of you harm.

24:27.675 --> 24:30.275
You and I, we are the
same, Skinshifters.

24:30.995 --> 24:33.195
We shouldn't be strangers to each other.

24:34.315 --> 24:35.795
Or enemies.

24:36.755 --> 24:38.555
On that we agree.

24:39.715 --> 24:42.475
Then don't attack
Herot. They're my people.

24:44.355 --> 24:46.395
Your people?

24:46.435 --> 24:48.274
What did Your people do when they

24:48.299 --> 24:50.299
found a Skinshifter in their midst?

24:54.915 --> 24:56.915
How long before they turn on you?

24:57.795 --> 24:59.795
That's my concern.

25:01.555 --> 25:03.555
Don't harm them.

25:04.715 --> 25:05.955
Please.

25:07.355 --> 25:09.515
I have no intention of attacking Herot.

25:10.435 --> 25:11.955
I have no need.

25:11.995 --> 25:15.195
The Redbloods are about
to rip each other to pieces.

25:16.715 --> 25:18.715
And I have a future to build.

25:19.795 --> 25:22.035
You could be a part of that future.

25:23.235 --> 25:27.955
You will never need to
lie, hide, or fear again.

25:29.955 --> 25:33.075
Or you can go back to
Herot and wait for death.

25:47.435 --> 25:49.395
Don't be scared now.

25:49.435 --> 25:51.435
I'm not.

25:51.475 --> 25:53.475
Good.

25:59.475 --> 26:01.155
Your shaking's back.

26:01.195 --> 26:02.595
It's cold.

26:05.195 --> 26:06.915
Just worry about yourself, Slean.

26:12.915 --> 26:14.915
They're here.

26:28.635 --> 26:30.395
Abrecan!

26:49.795 --> 26:51.155
Slean.

26:53.355 --> 26:55.755
You already know how this ends.

26:56.835 --> 26:58.835
You have... a dozen men?

27:00.675 --> 27:02.475
And I...

27:04.435 --> 27:06.035
lead an army.

27:10.195 --> 27:12.195
If you think you're leading them...

27:13.315 --> 27:15.515
then you really have lost your mind.

27:18.875 --> 27:20.955
The Wulfings will stab you in the back

27:21.795 --> 27:25.035
and walk right over your corpse
the moment you're no use to them.

27:26.835 --> 27:28.835
But there is a way back, Uncle.

27:30.195 --> 27:32.195
Send your men home.

27:33.515 --> 27:35.515
Stay here and fight with us.

27:38.395 --> 27:40.395
Die with honour.

27:45.675 --> 27:47.475
Is that what you want?

27:48.115 --> 27:49.915
To die here?

27:57.515 --> 27:59.355
Then go to our ancestors.

28:00.235 --> 28:01.555
Archers!

28:02.755 --> 28:04.275
Shields!

28:06.795 --> 28:08.795
Loose!

28:14.475 --> 28:16.475
- Loose!
- Open!

28:18.075 --> 28:19.355
Close!

28:19.395 --> 28:22.995
Rheda's troubles, whatever
they may be...

28:25.235 --> 28:26.755
are not mine.

28:26.795 --> 28:31.115
Rate, the survival of
Herot is in your hands.

28:31.995 --> 28:33.955
Just listen to what we ask.

28:33.995 --> 28:35.955
But you are not the first.

28:46.715 --> 28:48.715
Two sets of messengers.

28:48.755 --> 28:51.035
One from Herot, one from Bregan.

28:51.075 --> 28:54.595
Both so eager to be
heard, but which should I hear?

28:54.635 --> 28:57.915
This viper doesn't
deserve to be in your presence.

28:57.955 --> 29:00.675
Join with us. Take Herot by force.

29:00.715 --> 29:04.555
When he rules, Abrecan will see you
rewarded beyond your wildest dreams.

29:04.595 --> 29:06.400
Abrecan betrayed the alliance. Just

29:06.425 --> 29:08.155
as Rheda once claimed I had done.

29:08.195 --> 29:11.315
Because of his actions, your
brother Scorann is dead!

29:11.355 --> 29:14.115
- That was never Abrecan's intention!
- Enough!

29:17.075 --> 29:19.380
Why spill Varni
blood in a feud that is not

29:19.405 --> 29:21.475
of our making and not in our interest?

29:21.515 --> 29:23.675
No, fight your battles yourselves.

29:24.595 --> 29:25.875
Prove yourselves.

29:25.915 --> 29:29.075
Whichever side wins this
war shall have my support.

29:31.715 --> 29:34.355
Now leave. You're not welcome here.

29:34.395 --> 29:36.595
Get them out of my sight. Now!

29:36.635 --> 29:38.635
Wait!

29:42.955 --> 29:45.715
I am Varr... of the Varni.

29:48.075 --> 29:49.955
And I claim my bloodright.

29:54.195 --> 29:55.795
Well, that changes things.

30:09.395 --> 30:11.075
Whatever you feel for him,

30:11.115 --> 30:14.195
don't let his sacrifice be for nothing.

30:17.155 --> 30:19.155
Slean isn't ready.

30:21.595 --> 30:25.355
You must be Thane until he is.

30:59.795 --> 31:03.875
You know that my
brother is coming to visit us.

31:05.835 --> 31:07.795
Along with his friends.

31:07.835 --> 31:10.755
Some say that there's no
bond stronger than blood, but...

31:12.715 --> 31:14.715
I don't believe that.

31:16.155 --> 31:21.195
Iron and charcoal...
sweat brought us here.

31:22.235 --> 31:25.955
Opportunity. The chance
to carve out a future.

31:28.035 --> 31:32.475
May the ancestors forgive me,
but... that's stronger than blood.

31:34.555 --> 31:37.075
Let's give Abrecan a
welcome he can remember.

31:48.555 --> 31:50.555
Will the men hold?

31:52.035 --> 31:54.035
They'll hold!

32:00.035 --> 32:02.035
Why have they stopped?

32:02.995 --> 32:04.995
Break.

32:17.675 --> 32:20.475
We can cut the snake's head
off before its army gets here.

32:22.475 --> 32:24.475
Come and fight me, Uncle!

32:25.795 --> 32:28.995
Or are your Wulfing
friends afraid of a few Huskarla?

32:31.515 --> 32:33.595
Destroy them!

32:35.675 --> 32:37.355
Charge!

32:52.755 --> 32:54.635
Advance!

33:24.635 --> 33:26.035
Reform!

33:48.715 --> 33:50.435
Every moment we hold...

33:52.755 --> 33:56.035
allows our people time to prepare.

34:00.635 --> 34:03.075
Allows time for our allies to ride.

34:05.315 --> 34:08.333
People will talk of the Huskarla who

34:08.358 --> 34:11.619
held the Draca bridge for 500 summers.

34:12.435 --> 34:14.435
We will not be forgotten.

34:15.915 --> 34:17.995
None of you will ever be forgotten!

34:20.635 --> 34:23.034
We hold our lines!

34:27.074 --> 34:29.435
For Herot! For Herot!

34:35.594 --> 34:37.594
Slean will make a great Thane one day.

34:38.635 --> 34:42.195
So I won't have him
sacrificed at the hands of the Wulfing.

34:42.235 --> 34:43.835
That's my job.

34:44.635 --> 34:48.955
Now, Brinni, you take him back
to Herot. He's best needed there.

34:50.114 --> 34:52.275
Vishka, you too.

34:52.315 --> 34:54.114
I want to fight.

34:54.155 --> 34:57.355
No. You're the youngest
here with the most to live for.

34:58.795 --> 35:00.355
The both of you.

35:00.835 --> 35:02.835
And you're Huskarla.

35:04.315 --> 35:06.315
That's an order.

35:07.275 --> 35:09.275
You'll never be forgotten, Gil.

35:12.715 --> 35:14.715
Get out of here, go. Go!

35:16.835 --> 35:18.275
Vishka, help.

35:19.075 --> 35:21.075
Come on, Slean.

35:34.395 --> 35:36.991
Now, you think if Slean
got killed on this bridge

35:37.016 --> 35:39.275
any of us would be remembered
in any song?

35:39.315 --> 35:40.715
Huh?

35:43.555 --> 35:45.115
To your positions.

35:47.595 --> 35:48.875
Come on!

35:51.675 --> 35:53.675
Who wants to die first?

36:00.076 --> 36:02.116
The bloodright has been invoked.

36:02.156 --> 36:05.076
Two men, brothers.

36:05.116 --> 36:07.996
One man lives. No weapons.

36:09.276 --> 36:12.156
If that man is you, you
may have your favour.

36:13.356 --> 36:14.636
Begin!

36:16.916 --> 36:20.156
Our mother should have left you
on the plains for the crows to eat.

36:28.796 --> 36:30.436
Left, right...

36:35.716 --> 36:37.076
Get up!

36:39.356 --> 36:40.596
More!

36:51.676 --> 36:52.716
Argh!

37:09.996 --> 37:12.676
Read this message... from Rheda.

37:12.716 --> 37:14.716
Read it? That's all?

37:19.636 --> 37:21.636
You should have said.

37:22.636 --> 37:24.636
I would still have my champion.

37:41.156 --> 37:44.476
Beowulf, leave my
land. Go back to your people.

37:44.516 --> 37:46.316
That's it?

37:47.676 --> 37:49.676
You call yourself a warrior?

37:52.076 --> 37:55.236
- Varr.
- Oh, no. Varr stays here.

37:56.876 --> 38:00.676
The man who wins... doesn't
just take a life.

38:01.996 --> 38:04.676
He takes responsibility for
the dead man's family.

38:05.996 --> 38:07.996
Therefore I must stay.

38:10.196 --> 38:12.036
You can't stay here.

38:12.076 --> 38:13.676
I must.

38:14.716 --> 38:18.316
Perhaps I'll enjoy life
more here second time around.

38:21.236 --> 38:23.236
You won't change your mind?

38:24.356 --> 38:28.036
I have no choice. I've
nobody to go back for.

38:28.076 --> 38:29.476
Unlike you.

38:35.836 --> 38:38.236
The message. What was in it?

38:39.596 --> 38:41.476
It doesn't matter now.

38:45.436 --> 38:47.036
Goodbye, Beowulf.

38:47.916 --> 38:51.316
Tell Rheda I... failed her.

39:07.276 --> 39:09.116
Varr knew.

39:09.796 --> 39:13.076
He's condemned
himself to a life he despises.

39:13.116 --> 39:15.116
For nothing.

39:16.476 --> 39:18.476
Rate did exactly what you said he would.

39:19.396 --> 39:21.916
He burned your
message, told me to go home.

39:21.956 --> 39:23.956
That this battle was
not the Varni's fight.

39:25.076 --> 39:27.476
So now our only hope is Slean.

39:29.836 --> 39:31.836
He's at the Draca bridge.

39:33.636 --> 39:36.836
If he can hold it long enough the
Banning might get here in time.

39:39.516 --> 39:42.716
He'll die a hero instead of a traitor.

39:54.276 --> 39:56.396
What defences we have are ready.

39:56.436 --> 39:58.436
And so are the people.

40:00.316 --> 40:01.916
Slean's here.

40:27.556 --> 40:29.156
I bought you a day...

40:30.636 --> 40:33.596
in the hope that the
Banning will come and fight with us.

40:46.836 --> 40:48.836
Do you think that's enough?

40:51.596 --> 40:53.556
You betrayed me.

40:55.236 --> 40:57.236
You betrayed your people.

40:59.876 --> 41:03.796
You may fight with them if you
wish, but... you will never lead.

41:06.116 --> 41:08.116
You're not my son.

41:26.036 --> 41:27.396
Advance!

41:54.236 --> 41:56.236
Let's make camp here.

41:57.596 --> 41:59.316
Rest.

42:00.516 --> 42:02.516
We'll attack at first light.

42:04.636 --> 42:06.636
And tomorrow...

42:07.916 --> 42:09.916
Herot is ours.

42:16.676 --> 42:18.528
And tomorrow... you will hunt

42:18.553 --> 42:20.660
down Beowulf and avenge Jogan.

42:21.996 --> 42:23.996
Jogan was my brother.

42:25.356 --> 42:27.516
And Beowulf will die by my blade.

42:28.636 --> 42:30.636
I swear it.

42:31.796 --> 42:35.956
On the bones of the
restless dead, I swear it.

42:37.196 --> 42:42.356
His Thane, Herot, everyone
and everything in it.

42:43.636 --> 42:46.276
All that he holds precious to him...

42:47.876 --> 42:49.876
shall burn.

42:54.036 --> 42:57.836
We're not fighting today for
the iron they smelt in the pits.

42:59.236 --> 43:01.716
We're not fighting for
a Thane or a Jarl.

43:03.196 --> 43:06.436
We're not fighting for the gold
on the walls in Rheda's hall.

43:09.076 --> 43:11.076
We're fighting for family.

43:11.116 --> 43:13.116
We're fighting for friends.

43:13.156 --> 43:15.156
Come on!

43:16.396 --> 43:18.396
For those we care for.

43:19.396 --> 43:21.956
For those old piece
of dirt we call home.

43:23.636 --> 43:25.396
For Herot!
