WEBVTT

00:06.040 --> 00:08.208
- Roth of the Mere.
- Your husband

00:08.233 --> 00:10.160
promised us iron weapons.

00:10.200 --> 00:13.240
However, they must not be
simply a gift, but a dowry.

00:13.280 --> 00:15.560
A marriage between my son
and his daughter

00:15.600 --> 00:17.600
will make our alliance stronger.

00:17.640 --> 00:20.200
You'll go to Mere.
And take Elvina with you.

00:20.240 --> 00:22.160
- Why?
- She knows their ways,

00:22.200 --> 00:24.360
and you will forget her now.

00:28.840 --> 00:31.120
- Did you see something?
- It's nothing.

00:31.160 --> 00:33.520
You're behind all this.
You wanted to be Jarl,

00:33.560 --> 00:36.320
but you didn't want to be seen
to betray your own sister.

00:36.360 --> 00:37.800
Vlade was your man.

00:50.040 --> 00:51.720
We'll see you on the road to Mere.

00:51.760 --> 00:53.760
Now all we do is give Gorrik the dowry

00:53.800 --> 00:56.200
and get Slean's bride
safely back to Herot.

00:57.600 --> 00:59.600
What could possibly go wrong?

01:17.960 --> 01:20.200
Are you sure this is the right way?

01:20.240 --> 01:22.720
Roth said the Island
of Dunes. That's it.

01:29.520 --> 01:31.520
I'm tired.

01:32.120 --> 01:33.920
We can eat and rest in Mere.

01:33.960 --> 01:35.840
Hurry - the tide's coming in.

01:35.880 --> 01:37.640
Hey! Hey!

01:40.120 --> 01:42.120
A little help?

02:14.800 --> 02:17.520
You know when you're drunk,
and the ground moves?

02:25.000 --> 02:27.320
What if you're not drunk?

02:27.360 --> 02:29.360
Sandwyrm!

02:31.400 --> 02:35.280
Move! Quickly! Head to the dunes!

02:36.280 --> 02:38.440
Leave it, Beowulf! Leave it!

02:46.320 --> 02:49.480
Beowulf, hurry! We'll be
safe on the dunes.

02:58.200 --> 03:00.200
Run!

03:20.680 --> 03:23.640
Sandwyrms? You didn't
think to mention that?

03:23.680 --> 03:26.080
I'd heard stories. I didn't
think they were real.

03:38.160 --> 03:40.600
I am Beowulf, Reeve of Herot,

03:40.640 --> 03:43.200
here at Gorrik's request to
escort his daughter back

03:43.240 --> 03:45.360
to marry the son of our Thane.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.040
To bind our people.

03:47.080 --> 03:52.360
Yista erya kessu a! Yeh kuruyethu a!

03:52.400 --> 03:55.400
- W-What did he say?
- How about some food... and sleep?

04:40.200 --> 04:45.320
Quick as you can! Hey, out of the way!

04:46.400 --> 04:48.960
Coming through!

04:49.000 --> 04:51.280
That's it, boys. Well done!

04:51.320 --> 04:54.360
Mind your backs! Cart coming through!

04:56.840 --> 04:58.880
Come on, boys!

04:58.920 --> 05:01.800
That's it. Wheelbarrow...
just in there.

05:05.320 --> 05:07.960
Move it! You're blocking the way.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.120
- You said: dump it here.
- I said: there.

05:12.240 --> 05:14.240
Do it yourself.

05:17.960 --> 05:21.200
Move it, or I'll smelt your
feral bones to ash.

05:22.120 --> 05:23.920
I love it when you talk dirty.

05:23.960 --> 05:26.080
Right. What's going on?

05:26.120 --> 05:29.200
Tell this miner to move
his grimy iron ore.

05:29.840 --> 05:31.840
It's a smelter's job.

05:34.360 --> 05:37.760
Do it. Now.

05:39.840 --> 05:43.040
Just once, can the miners not start
a fight with the smelters?

05:43.080 --> 05:44.920
Well, where's the fun in that?

05:44.960 --> 05:48.840
Oi, beautiful! Warm your
bed for later!

05:53.120 --> 05:56.160
- Where are the others?
- I speak for them all now.

05:56.200 --> 05:59.240
We drew straws, and
I lost. They're afraid.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.800
They've heard about the
Skinshifter. And we're out of salt.

06:03.840 --> 06:05.640
It only arrived today from Bregan.

06:05.680 --> 06:09.160
Oi! Get that load up to the Hall.
Then half a cart for the miners.

06:10.240 --> 06:14.040
Slean! I need to talk to you.

06:14.080 --> 06:16.480
- How much ore have you brought?
- Only three carts.

06:16.520 --> 06:18.720
- You want payment in kind?
- Yeah.

06:18.760 --> 06:23.200
We need new spikes, two dozen new
ring-locks and pick-axe heads.

06:23.240 --> 06:25.280
Whatever's left we'll
take in food and coin.

06:25.320 --> 06:27.320
See to it.

06:28.600 --> 06:30.600
What is it?

06:35.240 --> 06:38.360
The stuff he wants... we don't
have it, not even half of it.

06:38.400 --> 06:40.800
Vishka's been working on the
weapons for the dowry.

06:40.840 --> 06:44.080
- How long will it take?
- I don't know. She's not here.

06:44.120 --> 06:46.120
Find her!

06:48.480 --> 06:50.640
You look thirsty.

06:50.680 --> 06:52.520
Have a drink.

06:52.560 --> 06:54.840
I want the tools. Now.

06:54.880 --> 06:56.080
Or what?

06:56.120 --> 06:58.320
Or I might just take
our ore to the Varni.

06:59.240 --> 07:01.680
Since Rheda banished their
Thane from the Alliance,

07:01.720 --> 07:04.000
they've been poaching your smelters.

07:04.040 --> 07:07.320
So... they can forge their
own iron weapons.

07:09.240 --> 07:11.240
And they're paying more than you.

07:12.080 --> 07:14.320
A lot more.

07:14.360 --> 07:16.800
If you want to take your
life in your own hands...

07:16.840 --> 07:19.160
then go ahead and deal with the Varni.

07:19.200 --> 07:21.200
Otherwise, you'll be paid tonight.

07:22.040 --> 07:24.320
Tonight the price is double.

07:24.360 --> 07:26.680
I set the price. By law.

07:26.720 --> 07:29.000
The word is, Rheda's making new laws.

07:30.600 --> 07:31.792
You want to go and ask Rheda to

07:31.793 --> 07:33.544
- change the law?
- Why not?

08:04.800 --> 08:07.240
Seems they have Warig
problems of their own.

08:19.160 --> 08:21.760
What is it?

08:21.800 --> 08:25.160
Remember the time my father
came back early from the hunt?

08:25.200 --> 08:27.720
- How could I forget?
- I can see it now.

08:27.760 --> 08:31.160
Him peering into the tent to check
that no man was with me.

08:41.760 --> 08:43.919
It's them. They've come for you.

08:43.960 --> 08:46.000
- It can't be.
- Who else?

08:46.040 --> 08:48.160
You must go back. Play along.

08:48.200 --> 08:51.760
As soon as dark comes,
slip away. I'll meet you here.

08:54.040 --> 08:56.040
I'd die before I'd be with another.

09:22.720 --> 09:25.680
Let me speak to your Thane. Gorrik.

09:30.120 --> 09:32.920
We're tired and hungry,
and she's injured.

09:37.160 --> 09:41.440
Hesta askuya eklathuai ma,
ni-hesse eklathuai reh?

09:41.480 --> 09:45.040
You speak the old tongue. Who are you?

09:45.080 --> 09:47.440
My parents were Mere.
They fled the massacre.

09:47.480 --> 09:49.680
So, you've come back to your people.

09:50.720 --> 09:54.360
Untie us. Our business is with
Gorrik, not his guard-dogs.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.440
What do you expect me to do with this?

10:18.320 --> 10:22.000
Have a little respect for
your elders and betters.

10:22.040 --> 10:24.040
Gorrik.

10:25.560 --> 10:28.520
You're supposed to be the
Reeve. Where have you been?

10:29.160 --> 10:31.160
Search them.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.960
Where's Roth? Where's the messenger
I sent to Herot to guide you here?

10:47.000 --> 10:49.120
He died.

10:49.160 --> 10:51.680
- How?
- We were attacked by Warig.

10:51.720 --> 10:55.320
I told you... the Warig.
They killed Roth.

10:59.000 --> 11:03.360
Where's the dowry? Where are my
weapons? I don't see them.

11:03.400 --> 11:07.560
And you won't, until you feed
us and show us the bride.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.450
- Father, you're needed.
- Not now.

11:09.475 --> 11:11.504
It's Shay. You have to come now.

11:14.400 --> 11:17.680
Give them water. No food.

11:45.200 --> 11:48.560
Father, if Shay dies, the  people
may lose hope altogether.

11:48.600 --> 11:52.040
Where's your sister?
Where's Mara? Is she safe?

11:52.080 --> 11:54.800
Is Mara safe?

12:00.520 --> 12:02.520
Move her.

12:12.040 --> 12:14.520
Was that the party from Herot?

12:14.560 --> 12:16.560
We need this alliance with them.

12:16.600 --> 12:19.680
If you injure them, all the work
you've done to keep our people safe

12:19.720 --> 12:21.720
will have been for nothing.

12:35.021 --> 12:39.141
Come before me again for stealing,
and I'll take your hands,

12:39.181 --> 12:40.941
not just your coin.

12:40.981 --> 12:43.376
He gets what he deserves!

12:43.401 --> 12:44.541
That's not right!

12:44.581 --> 12:46.581
Out of the way. Out of the way.

12:47.541 --> 12:49.541
We're being robbed!

12:50.821 --> 12:53.181
- Who's stealing from you?
- He is.

12:53.221 --> 12:55.661
And you are.

12:58.101 --> 13:00.901
- Excuse me?
- You're excused... Thane...

13:00.941 --> 13:02.941
Wait.

13:03.781 --> 13:07.701
I dealt with your father. I can
deal with this much man.

13:10.021 --> 13:12.021
That's right.

13:12.781 --> 13:14.781
Say your piece.

13:16.061 --> 13:18.061
My name is Greff.

13:18.981 --> 13:21.901
I was born out there,
in one of those pits,

13:21.941 --> 13:25.301
where we scrape together the
ore that pays for all of this.

13:25.341 --> 13:27.341
The ore that makes you rich.

13:27.381 --> 13:31.021
So, in return, I and the
others out there,

13:31.061 --> 13:33.941
we ask for a fair price
for the blood and sweat

13:33.981 --> 13:35.581
we spill to bring it here.

13:35.621 --> 13:38.781
- We pay what the market will bear.
- Not today, you didn't.

13:39.501 --> 13:41.501
Why not?

13:43.181 --> 13:46.981
Because the smithies were working on
the weapons for the Mere dowry.

13:48.021 --> 13:49.901
The tools will be ready this evening,

13:49.941 --> 13:52.701
yet he is demanding that
we pay him double,

13:52.741 --> 13:54.741
if he has to wait.

13:55.901 --> 13:58.781
Or... make a new law.

13:59.301 --> 14:02.301
Say what each cart is
worth until next winter.

14:02.341 --> 14:04.581
Give us fair prices that
don't go up and down

14:04.621 --> 14:06.461
like the temper of a Wulfing wench.

14:09.901 --> 14:13.381
That... or I will take
our ore to the Varni.

14:15.781 --> 14:18.381
Don't mistake laughter
for support, Greff.

14:18.421 --> 14:21.381
They'll be cheering if I order
you hanged for insolence.

14:25.621 --> 14:27.621
But you're right.

14:28.461 --> 14:30.861
The work...

14:30.901 --> 14:33.261
the risks you take out
there in the forest...

14:33.301 --> 14:35.461
should be fairly rewarded.

14:39.861 --> 14:41.781
You will have your law.

14:44.501 --> 14:47.821
But only if you earn it
by showing loyalty.

14:47.861 --> 14:51.661
Award Herot sole rights to
any ore that you mine.

14:52.301 --> 14:54.341
No more talk of the Varni.

14:54.381 --> 14:57.661
And you'll wait until this
evening to be paid.

14:59.741 --> 15:02.781
If I have the law, you have my word.

15:12.541 --> 15:15.101
We will reconvene shortly.

15:19.461 --> 15:22.181
You yield to every demand
that's made of you.

15:22.221 --> 15:25.301
Are you talking about
my laws or your marriage?

15:25.341 --> 15:27.501
Both. You should have asked.

15:28.621 --> 15:30.821
Marriage should have been my choice.

15:30.861 --> 15:34.741
I said the same thing to my father
when I was told to marry Hrothgar.

15:36.701 --> 15:39.181
- You said you loved him.
- I did.

15:40.301 --> 15:42.301
After a time.

15:45.661 --> 15:47.741
You were with someone before Father?

15:49.541 --> 15:51.541
Erm...

15:52.021 --> 15:54.101
He married another girl from Bregan.

15:56.901 --> 15:59.101
He was a terrible fisherman.

15:59.141 --> 16:01.621
And he grew very, very, very fat.

16:05.541 --> 16:07.541
It was a lucky escape.

16:11.381 --> 16:14.061
I loved your father as I
never thought I would.

16:16.061 --> 16:19.901
Sometimes choices made
for us are the best,

16:19.941 --> 16:22.061
without emotions clouding judgment.

16:26.381 --> 16:28.901
I was angry with the
miner, but he was right...

16:29.501 --> 16:32.781
... and our power rests on their
hard work and co-operation.

16:34.301 --> 16:37.221
He'll have his payment before sunset.

16:42.181 --> 16:45.541
Slean, I'll need you to set the price.

16:54.581 --> 16:57.501
- He's growing up.
- And when he's full-grown...

16:58.341 --> 17:00.341
... will you step aside?

17:14.781 --> 17:16.781
Away you go.

17:19.781 --> 17:22.381
These people - they're scared.

17:41.381 --> 17:44.661
We've not had visitors for a long time.

17:48.621 --> 17:50.621
You must eat.

17:57.501 --> 17:59.501
The alley. Now.

18:01.541 --> 18:03.661
- Go ahead.
- Vlade...

18:04.981 --> 18:07.301
You're alive? What do you want?

18:07.341 --> 18:09.181
Abrecan wants to know
if you'll help him

18:09.221 --> 18:11.941
become Jarl of the Shieldlands
in Rheda's place.

18:13.941 --> 18:16.101
Betray my mother to
further his ambition?

18:16.141 --> 18:20.021
And your own. Your reward will be to
take her place as Thane of Herot.

18:21.381 --> 18:23.821
As Abrecan's vassal?

18:23.861 --> 18:26.381
We all serve somebody or something.

18:27.781 --> 18:30.101
I leave for Bregan before nightfall.

18:30.141 --> 18:32.141
You have your answer ready.

18:47.021 --> 18:49.621
It's good of you to have
come all this way.

18:53.421 --> 18:55.461
Be seated, guests.

19:02.861 --> 19:04.861
Daughters...

19:18.741 --> 19:20.741
Sit.

19:23.901 --> 19:27.301
And the prize you are
here to take from us...

19:28.781 --> 19:32.101
Mara, my first-born.

19:34.381 --> 19:36.701
It is an...

19:39.181 --> 19:41.701
It is an honour to bind
our tribes in marriage.

20:05.941 --> 20:08.741
For our honoured guests.

20:09.901 --> 20:11.621
What is that?

20:11.661 --> 20:14.141
Sandwyrm. This one's a year old.

20:14.181 --> 20:17.581
We preserved it for a
special occasion.

20:19.101 --> 20:21.781
- It's a year old?
- Eat.

20:21.821 --> 20:24.621
The longer it's kept,
the better it tastes.

20:34.261 --> 20:36.261
Hmm. I've had worse.

20:53.581 --> 20:57.181
Lila, the miners must have
their payment by tonight.

20:57.221 --> 20:59.301
I can't do this without Vishka.

20:59.341 --> 21:01.341
Nobody's seen her.

21:05.661 --> 21:07.501
What are you doing?

21:07.541 --> 21:09.541
If you can do better, help yourself.

21:10.781 --> 21:12.781
Give me that.

21:22.221 --> 21:24.901
Don't just stand there. Bellows.

21:25.981 --> 21:28.381
Brinni, come on. We've
got to get this done.

21:34.821 --> 21:36.821
Mmm.

21:37.541 --> 21:40.061
Maybe we got off on the
wrong foot with Gorrik.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.421
Some Sandwyrm, and you're anybody's.

21:47.501 --> 21:49.501
How did you hurt your arm?

21:50.821 --> 21:52.381
Warig arrow.

21:52.421 --> 21:57.061
The man who brought us here, Roth,
had a daughter, who was a healer.

21:57.781 --> 21:59.781
Is she here?

22:00.341 --> 22:03.181
Shay? No. She's not here.

22:09.341 --> 22:14.261
This Slean must count himself the
luckiest man in the Shieldlands,

22:14.301 --> 22:16.781
to be married to my daughter.

22:19.981 --> 22:22.781
Then why doesn't he come
here to fetch her himself?

22:25.821 --> 22:28.581
Slean had duties in Herot.

22:28.621 --> 22:31.101
It's not as if that is the only insult.

22:32.021 --> 22:34.821
They let Roth give his
life to protect the dowry,

22:34.861 --> 22:36.501
and then refuse to present it...

22:36.541 --> 22:38.541
Enough!

22:39.501 --> 22:41.501
He's right, though, isn't he?

22:42.181 --> 22:45.341
I see no dowry, no groom.

22:45.381 --> 22:49.461
All you have to give me
are words, words, words...

22:49.501 --> 22:53.181
that twist and writhe
like eels in my head.

22:53.221 --> 22:57.061
You've seen the bride.
You've eaten at my table.

22:57.101 --> 22:59.821
Where are my iron weapons?

23:00.781 --> 23:02.901
Mara?!

23:02.941 --> 23:05.181
- Mara?
- She's burning up.

23:07.741 --> 23:09.461
What's wrong with her?

23:09.501 --> 23:11.501
Sea fever.

23:13.741 --> 23:16.141
Get me liquor. We need
to bring down her fever.

23:16.181 --> 23:18.781
Ah, it's not the food.

23:18.821 --> 23:21.581
- Why should I trust you?
- I'm a healer.

23:23.581 --> 23:25.741
Give her whatever she needs!

23:28.221 --> 23:30.221
Rub her limbs with it.

23:37.221 --> 23:40.141
If it's sea fever, there must
be others that are sick.

23:41.901 --> 23:43.901
Take me to them... now.

23:50.581 --> 23:53.181
This is where we care for our sick.

24:12.901 --> 24:15.421
- Your healer...?
- You're looking at her.

24:15.461 --> 24:19.021
- She's a child.
- The children of Mere grow up fast.

24:20.461 --> 24:22.141
You should have told us.

24:22.181 --> 24:25.501
And have you tell Rheda
the Mere are feeble and sick?

24:25.541 --> 24:29.301
- Would you prefer proud and dead?
- I'd prefer to have Roth here alive.

24:29.341 --> 24:32.101
Instead, I'm to tell his
daughter, if she survives,

24:32.141 --> 24:34.141
that she's an orphan.

24:35.261 --> 24:37.621
If this marriage doesn't happen,

24:37.661 --> 24:40.941
we won't have Rheda's iron
weapons to defend ourselves...

24:42.061 --> 24:44.061
... and we'll all die.

25:12.145 --> 25:14.345
Where did you learn to do this?

25:16.465 --> 25:19.505
Right here. The old
smith, Marton, taught me.

25:19.545 --> 25:21.545
He was a good man.

25:22.425 --> 25:24.665
Kind.

25:24.705 --> 25:26.985
I used to come down
here when my father...

25:27.945 --> 25:30.065
... when I didn't want to
have to think any more

25:30.105 --> 25:32.185
about who I was or
what my duties were.

25:33.865 --> 25:35.865
We all have to hide away sometimes.

25:37.425 --> 25:39.905
It's just a shame we have
to go back out there.

26:04.465 --> 26:06.145
Can you save her?

26:06.185 --> 26:08.825
So she can be forced to marry
a man who doesn't want her?

26:08.865 --> 26:11.345
If I was her, I'd be glad
to get out of here.

26:11.385 --> 26:15.145
It's not 'here'...  it's 'who'.
She's in love with the Reeve.

26:15.185 --> 26:17.345
Sounds familiar.

26:17.385 --> 26:19.945
Oh, don't flatter yourself!

26:21.705 --> 26:23.865
She's very weak...

26:23.905 --> 26:26.745
but there might be a way we
can help her and these others.

26:26.785 --> 26:30.705
My father said the Warig believe a
gland in the Sandwyrm's neck

26:30.745 --> 26:32.985
could be used to fight the fever.

26:33.025 --> 26:35.385
What would Mudborn
know of such things?

26:35.425 --> 26:37.425
It's her only hope.

26:41.025 --> 26:43.065
But, anyway, there's only so long

26:43.105 --> 26:45.425
before you have to tell
Gorrik the dowry's lost.

26:45.465 --> 26:48.305
So, we have to hunt a Sandwyrm?

26:51.385 --> 26:53.505
I'll speak to him.

27:07.625 --> 27:09.825
Beautiful.

27:09.865 --> 27:12.265
It's for Mara. For the wedding.

27:15.865 --> 27:18.265
My father would rather
it was I who was sick.

27:20.025 --> 27:22.025
No father would ever wish that.

27:27.945 --> 27:29.945
Do you want to try?

27:36.065 --> 27:38.465
She has an old soul, that one.

27:39.305 --> 27:41.385
And her mother's mind.

27:44.225 --> 27:46.105
Where's my dowry?

27:46.145 --> 27:48.145
You can't fight illness with iron.

27:54.345 --> 27:56.345
You don't need weapons.

27:56.745 --> 27:58.745
You need medicine.

27:59.065 --> 28:03.265
Swords may not fight the fever,
but they can cut down Mudborn.

28:03.745 --> 28:06.505
As a warrior, you understand that.

28:08.185 --> 28:11.185
Old as I am, I put
you in the dirt, didn't I?

28:13.585 --> 28:15.705
Why reach out to Herot now?

28:15.745 --> 28:19.145
The Warig. Their war
bands are coming together.

28:19.185 --> 28:22.465
This time, they mean to
destroy us. All of us.

28:23.345 --> 28:25.145
- How do you know?
- That dead Warig we

28:25.170 --> 28:26.345
hung up above the dunes

28:26.385 --> 28:28.385
talked before it died.

28:29.265 --> 28:35.042
There's a prophet moving through
the Edgelands, stirring them up.

28:35.425 --> 28:37.545
They call him Red Tongue.

28:37.585 --> 28:39.705
They say he drinks human blood.

28:40.545 --> 28:43.105
The days of peace are over.

28:43.145 --> 28:45.905
As sure as the tide, war is coming.

28:48.545 --> 28:52.625
You'll give me my weapons at first
light, or I'll keep your healer,

28:52.665 --> 28:57.185
cut your throats and tell Rheda the
Sandwyrm swallowed the lot of you.

28:58.225 --> 29:00.745
The Wyrms may be your
daughter's only chance.

29:02.225 --> 29:04.825
Elvina believes there's a
gland in the beast's neck

29:04.865 --> 29:07.825
that can be used against the
fever. If we kill one of them...

29:07.865 --> 29:10.545
We don't hunt them any
more. It's too dangerous.

29:13.145 --> 29:15.145
Then I'll go alone.

29:16.465 --> 29:18.465
And die for your trouble.

29:20.705 --> 29:22.625
The Wyrms are territorial.

29:22.665 --> 29:25.825
They never stray across
each other's boundaries.

29:25.865 --> 29:28.905
Only we know the paths
that lie between them.

29:29.905 --> 29:31.905
That's why we're safe here.

29:35.145 --> 29:37.145
But you'll go, anyway.

29:38.465 --> 29:40.465
Won't you?

30:00.025 --> 30:02.025
It's harder than it looks.

30:02.465 --> 30:06.145
My father said all the women in
Herot have beautiful gowns of gold.

30:06.785 --> 30:10.305
And there's a great hall for
feasting, food all year round...

30:10.345 --> 30:12.345
You're laughing at me. Why?

30:13.145 --> 30:15.065
Do I look like I wear gowns?

30:17.265 --> 30:19.265
Herot is...

30:21.145 --> 30:23.145
Well, I used to think it was boring.

30:24.145 --> 30:26.785
- But now...
- You miss it?

30:29.665 --> 30:32.865
I wouldn't miss it
here, if I left ever.

30:41.985 --> 30:44.625
- Mara...
- Rowan?

30:44.665 --> 30:47.305
I'll never let them take
you away from me.

30:47.345 --> 30:49.345
You won't have to.

30:50.385 --> 30:53.865
They don't have the
dowry. It is lost.

30:53.905 --> 30:55.905
Are you sure?

30:56.385 --> 30:58.385
I overheard them.

31:01.465 --> 31:06.025
Tell my father. Without the weapons,
he'll never agree to them taking me.

31:08.225 --> 31:10.025
Which one is Shay, Roth's daughter?

31:10.065 --> 31:12.465
Vishka, please, go back
to the settlement.

31:12.905 --> 31:14.905
I'm the reason her father's dead.

31:15.985 --> 31:18.905
If I can survive the Warig,
I think I can fight a fever.

31:33.985 --> 31:36.425
I'll string them up with the Warig!

31:36.465 --> 31:38.625
No dowry. No weapons.

31:39.185 --> 31:42.225
Damn them. Nobody
cheats me and lives.

31:42.265 --> 31:46.985
We survived out here for years
because we trusted no-one.

31:47.025 --> 31:48.825
Cared only for each other.

31:48.865 --> 31:50.945
Speak plainly.

31:50.985 --> 31:54.505
If Beowulf wishes to hunt the Wyrm
for the gland that can save Mara,

31:54.545 --> 31:57.545
let him. I will help him.

31:57.585 --> 31:59.585
Why?

31:59.985 --> 32:01.985
What's in it for you?

32:02.545 --> 32:04.545
If she lives...

32:06.025 --> 32:08.025
... she'll be mine.

32:09.905 --> 32:11.665
I knew it.

32:11.705 --> 32:13.705
Yes or no?

32:18.745 --> 32:20.745
Save Mara...

32:21.385 --> 32:24.265
... kill Beowulf, and we have a deal.

33:12.625 --> 33:14.425
Over there.

33:14.465 --> 33:16.865
- What do I do with this?
- Try not to miss.

33:17.665 --> 33:19.665
Bring it to us, Beowulf.

33:27.065 --> 33:29.065
Hold.

33:29.545 --> 33:32.665
Hold. Hold.

33:33.105 --> 33:35.185
Hold!

33:46.145 --> 33:48.145
Aaaarghh!

33:50.625 --> 33:53.105
Aim for the neck! Now!

33:55.185 --> 33:57.185
Rowan, throw it!

34:00.945 --> 34:02.905
I can't hold it. Help me.

34:08.065 --> 34:10.065
We've got it now!

34:11.505 --> 34:13.505
Finish it!

34:23.784 --> 34:25.784
Where's the gland?

34:34.425 --> 34:36.425
It looked better on a plate.

34:39.465 --> 34:41.465
Got it.

34:43.665 --> 34:46.784
Wishing you hadn't 
eaten all that Sandwyrm?

34:49.264 --> 34:52.945
Hey! How are we supposed 
to find our way back?

34:52.985 --> 34:55.385
Gorrik knows there's no dowry.

34:55.425 --> 34:57.425
Return, and he will kill you.

35:00.705 --> 35:02.705
Beowulf...

35:14.265 --> 35:16.665
Looks like we've bagged 
ourselves a bride.

35:21.945 --> 35:24.145
Gorrik, I have the gland.

35:24.185 --> 35:26.345
- And Beowulf?
- Will not return.

35:28.745 --> 35:30.665
Take it to the healer.

35:30.705 --> 35:33.305
See that Mara is treated first.

35:37.065 --> 35:39.065
She's mine now.

35:40.745 --> 35:42.745
Here.

35:48.665 --> 35:50.665
Keep up.

35:59.145 --> 36:01.385
We don't have to go back.

36:01.425 --> 36:03.665
Without somebody who knows the path,

36:03.705 --> 36:06.185
we'll probably be eaten 
before we get there.

36:06.225 --> 36:08.545
If we leave and don't 
deliver the dowry,

36:08.585 --> 36:10.585
Gorrik will kill Elvina and Vishka.

36:11.225 --> 36:13.505
We just need to follow 
his footsteps back.

36:20.705 --> 36:22.985
They got the gland 
from a Wyrm, didn't they?

36:23.025 --> 36:25.025
You can save Mara, can't you?

36:25.825 --> 36:27.825
She has a chance now.

36:34.065 --> 36:36.065
How many more to go?

36:37.145 --> 36:39.065
That's it. Done.

36:39.105 --> 36:42.185
Rheda will be grateful. You 
saved her from looking a fool

36:42.225 --> 36:44.225
in front of the miners.

36:48.305 --> 36:51.465
Fixed prices, to be reviewed 
at the agreed time,

36:51.505 --> 36:54.385
in return for Herot's exclusive
rights to the mines.

36:54.425 --> 36:57.065
- The law you asked for.
- Make your mark.

36:58.385 --> 37:01.265
I'm a miner.

37:01.305 --> 37:03.505
My word's stronger 
than any parchment.

37:06.025 --> 37:07.745
Let's leave it at that, shall we?

37:07.785 --> 37:10.065
Brinni, help him load 
this onto his cart.

37:12.145 --> 37:14.785
The smith girl. She did well...

37:15.585 --> 37:17.705
... considering no-one could find her.

37:21.105 --> 37:24.345
Even as a boy, you always had 
the capacity to surprise me.

37:25.665 --> 37:27.665
Just like your father.

37:28.185 --> 37:30.185
He would be proud of you.

37:50.105 --> 37:52.385
I don't understand.

37:52.425 --> 37:54.945
Everyone else is responding 
but your sister.

38:06.345 --> 38:08.345
It's the dowry.

38:10.145 --> 38:12.145
Here's your dowry.

38:21.185 --> 38:24.825
Once Slean's wed to your 
daughter, there'll be more.

38:24.865 --> 38:26.865
As much as Herot can spare.

38:30.945 --> 38:33.225
We leave as soon as 
Mara's fit to travel.

38:37.905 --> 38:39.905
See how my daughter is.

38:54.905 --> 38:58.105
Where's Rowan? Why 
hasn't he come for me?

38:59.465 --> 39:01.465
I'm here.

39:09.465 --> 39:11.465
She's dying.

39:13.905 --> 39:15.905
Did you tell my father?

39:16.545 --> 39:18.545
Am I yours?

39:20.505 --> 39:23.145
Yes, my love. We'll be together.

39:23.185 --> 39:25.185
And we'll have six children.

39:27.425 --> 39:29.305
More, if you'd like.

39:51.905 --> 39:53.905
Mara...

40:12.385 --> 40:14.385
Mara's dead.

40:33.585 --> 40:35.585
I'm so sorry.

40:53.465 --> 40:55.225
Gorrik...

40:55.265 --> 40:58.465
I... have... a daughter to bury.

41:01.665 --> 41:05.305
Tell Rheda I withdraw my vote.

41:28.625 --> 41:30.785
If war is coming, you need us.

41:30.825 --> 41:32.825
He's right.

41:33.945 --> 41:36.583
You were wise to reach out to Herot.

41:37.945 --> 41:40.545
Without these weapons and 
the support of the Alliance,

41:40.585 --> 41:42.865
our people will wither 
away and die here.

41:45.465 --> 41:48.105
We must keep our word to Rheda.

41:48.145 --> 41:51.345
My daughter is dead.

41:51.385 --> 41:53.385
You have another.

41:55.745 --> 41:57.745
I forbid it.

41:59.985 --> 42:01.985
Kela, I...

42:02.625 --> 42:04.625
I need you here.

42:07.025 --> 42:09.025
But you will release me.

42:10.305 --> 42:12.825
So I can be Slean's 
bride, for the Mere.

42:15.065 --> 42:17.065
And my sister's memory.

42:21.105 --> 42:23.105
You have your weapons.

42:24.545 --> 42:27.407
I'm sorry. It's the only way.

42:29.265 --> 42:31.265
Take her.

42:33.025 --> 42:35.025
Does your support for Rheda stand?

42:40.425 --> 42:42.425
It does.

42:50.825 --> 42:52.825
Thank you.

42:59.785 --> 43:02.665
You can tell Abrecan my answer is no.

43:02.705 --> 43:04.705
Then you are a fool.

43:05.345 --> 43:08.425
Your father was right 
to pass you over

43:08.465 --> 43:10.545
and your mother to 
make you her smith.

43:12.465 --> 43:16.900
Well, tell my uncle I'll choose 
my destiny. And his.

43:18.385 --> 43:20.385
Go!

43:34.745 --> 43:38.185
Take care over the sands 
and on your journey home.

43:38.225 --> 43:40.225
These men will escort you.

43:44.385 --> 43:46.385
Watch over her.

43:46.705 --> 43:48.785
The Mere are no longer alone, Gorrik.

43:49.505 --> 43:52.603
If you need us, send word.

43:52.665 --> 43:55.345
All the tribes will have 
need of each other,

43:55.385 --> 43:58.860
as the tides of blood that 
are coming wash over us.

45:31.865 --> 45:33.305
War is coming.

45:33.345 --> 45:36.145
They have a leader. A 
prophet, they call him.

45:36.185 --> 45:37.705
He tells them the time has come

45:37.745 --> 45:39.342
to wash the Shieldlands clean with

45:39.367 --> 45:40.665
- red blood. 
- You're safe here.

45:40.705 --> 45:42.945
- You're not prepared for an attack.
- Then fix it.

45:42.985 --> 45:44.825
Herot needs a real Thane.

45:44.865 --> 45:48.665
And the Shieldlands need 
a true Jarl to lead its tribes.

45:48.705 --> 45:50.745
You could be one and I the other.

45:50.785 --> 45:53.025
It's real!

45:53.065 --> 45:54.465
Troll!

45:55.305 --> 46:01.887
