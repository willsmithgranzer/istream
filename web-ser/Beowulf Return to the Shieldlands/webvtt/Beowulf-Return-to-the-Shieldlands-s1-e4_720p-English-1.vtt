Without Scorann I will not

I'll see you don't get
the majority you need.

00:16.708 --> 00:18.524
Isn't it convenient that your brother

00:18.549 --> 00:20.388
vanishes on the eve of the Gathering?

00:20.428 --> 00:21.947
Convenient for who?

00:21.947 --> 00:24.263
For anyone who wants
Rheda to lose the vote.

00:24.348 --> 00:27.788
Rheda shall keep peace in the

I'm better with a blade but
I can only make them.

You get to use one in battle.

Your people don't want justice.
They want to see strength.

Bayen's death. The Skinshifter is dead.

it to do his bidding still lives.

Two of us on one
horse... even on foot...

42:27.312 --> 42:29.272
they'd catch up to us
in an hour or two.

42:29.312 --> 42:31.912
Here. I know what
will slow them down.

42:36.232 --> 42:38.672
- (SPEAKS IN WARIG LANGUAGE)
- This ends here.

42:38.712 --> 42:40.712
(SPEAKS WARIG LANGUAGE)

42:42.432 --> 42:44.392
(ROARS)

42:46.672 --> 42:48.512
(ROARS)

42:55.352 --> 42:57.352
(MOANING AND GROWLING)

42:57.392 --> 42:59.392
(GROWLS)

43:04.472 --> 43:06.472
(WAILING)

43:30.152 --> 43:32.152
The Island of Dunes.

43:34.632 --> 43:36.632
Home of the Mere.

43:51.432 --> 43:54.112
Good to see you again, friend.

43:56.072 --> 43:58.072
(LAUGHS)

44:03.472 --> 44:05.472
You're alive?

44:06.312 --> 44:08.312
Is that going to be awkward?

44:10.552 --> 44:12.552
Should it be?

44:12.992 --> 44:14.592
No.

44:23.352 --> 44:25.272
That's it.

44:25.312 --> 44:27.952
Now all we have to do is
give Gorrik the dowry

44:27.992 --> 44:30.912
and get Slean's bride
safely back to Herot.

44:32.392 --> 44:34.392
What could possible go wrong.

44:49.512 --> 44:51.512
(RUMBLING)

44:59.992 --> 45:03.312
Have a little respect for
your elders and betters.

45:04.552 --> 45:06.059
- Vlade?
- Abrecan wants to know

45:06.084 --> 45:07.512
if you'll help him become

45:07.552 --> 45:09.872
Jarl of the Shieldlands
in Rheda's place.

45:09.912 --> 45:12.992
And the prize you are
here to take from us...

45:13.472 --> 45:15.472
Mara... my firstborn.

45:15.672 --> 45:17.872
She's burning up. What's
wrong with her?

45:17.912 --> 45:20.004
- Sea fever.
- My father would rather it

45:20.029 --> 45:21.192
was I who was sick.

45:21.232 --> 45:22.912
No father would ever wish that.

45:22.952 --> 45:25.992
The Warig believe that a gland
found in the sand wrym's neck

45:26.032 --> 45:28.912
- can be used to fight the fever.
- We have to hunt the sand wrym.

45:28.952 --> 45:31.552
You know when you're drunk
and the ground moves?

45:31.592 --> 45:33.592
- What if you're not drunk?
- Sand wryms!
