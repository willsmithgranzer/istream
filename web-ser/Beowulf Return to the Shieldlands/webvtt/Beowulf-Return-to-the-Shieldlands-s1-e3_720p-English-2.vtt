WEBVTT

00:02.830 --> 00:05.240
because they can live
amongst us undetected.

00:05.280 --> 00:07.520
- Can you find it and kill it?
- If it's still here.

00:11.040 --> 00:14.760
Rate wishes to see himself made Jarl
of the Shieldlands instead of you.

00:14.800 --> 00:18.320
I'll see you don't get the
majority you need at the Gathering.

00:18.360 --> 00:20.560
It's you! You killed them.

00:20.600 --> 00:22.480
To protect my family.

00:25.840 --> 00:28.699
I believe the Skinshifter was
acting on someone else's part.

00:28.724 --> 00:30.480
It was about stirring up the tribes.

00:30.520 --> 00:32.400
Uh! Uhh...

00:32.439 --> 00:34.920
My son, has he returned?

00:36.440 --> 00:38.440
That's Slean's horse!

01:26.640 --> 01:28.640
Hey! Get away from there!

01:32.560 --> 01:34.360
Oi!

01:42.400 --> 01:44.880
I hear there will soon
be a new widow in town.

01:44.920 --> 01:46.200
Ah!

02:37.400 --> 02:39.000
Uhh.

02:49.480 --> 02:51.680
It's me you want. Let him go.

02:52.400 --> 02:54.400
Can we kill him now?

02:54.440 --> 02:57.600
Someone will pay to have
him back. In one piece!

02:57.640 --> 02:59.760
Look at the sword.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
- What do you say?
- I say he's barelyable to grow a beard.

03:05.040 --> 03:07.040
And this?

03:10.920 --> 03:12.920
This is a man's blade.

03:23.760 --> 03:25.760
Beowulf.

03:33.360 --> 03:35.360
Feel the weight.

03:41.400 --> 03:43.880
'Twas a gift from my father.

03:54.360 --> 03:56.000
Uhh!

03:56.040 --> 03:57.840
Get up!

03:58.920 --> 04:00.920
Move your arses!

04:00.960 --> 04:04.720
If we don't get Scorann to
Ramin's Tomb, we don't get paid.

04:04.760 --> 04:07.480
Where I come from, we have
a name for scum like you.

04:08.440 --> 04:09.920
Move!

04:49.160 --> 04:52.280
When Slean's horse passed
this way, it still had a rider.

04:52.320 --> 04:53.960
My brother?

04:54.000 --> 04:56.520
If Slean met Scorann, it wasn't here.

04:58.600 --> 05:01.120
These lands aren't as
safe as they once were.

05:02.040 --> 05:04.520
There was a Mudborn,
out by the Silver Lake.

05:04.560 --> 05:06.280
A strange thing.

05:06.320 --> 05:08.320
With a severed hand?

05:09.320 --> 05:10.920
We met.

05:12.920 --> 05:15.360
If you're scared, you can wait here.

05:15.400 --> 05:18.320
And leave the fate of The
Shieldlands in your hands?

05:19.920 --> 05:21.920
I'm here for Slean.

05:23.240 --> 05:26.320
Did the Skinshifter
regain consciousness yet?

05:26.360 --> 05:29.160
As soon as Koll can be
questioned, I'll be informed.

05:29.200 --> 05:32.400
Until such time, his wife is
our only means of finding out

05:32.440 --> 05:35.040
who ordered the creature
to murder my Reeve.

05:35.080 --> 05:37.640
I'll have her brought to you.

05:39.200 --> 05:42.080
Why aren't you out searching
for Scorann and my son?

05:42.120 --> 05:45.800
I ordered the Huskarla
be stationed around Herot.

05:47.280 --> 05:49.280
It must be seen to be protected.

05:50.400 --> 05:52.600
Your people are scared and angry.

05:52.640 --> 05:56.640
They don't understand why you've
chosen to keep the Skinshifter alive.

05:57.640 --> 06:01.160
Tomorrow morning, the other
Thanes will vote at the Gathering.

06:01.200 --> 06:04.720
Without Scorann, I will not have
enough support to become Jarl.

06:04.760 --> 06:06.900
Scorann will be found. His brother Rate and

06:06.925 --> 06:09.040
Beowulf are out there looking for him now.

06:09.080 --> 06:11.800
There are no finer
warriors in The Shieldlands.

06:13.480 --> 06:16.609
They will find Slean, I am certain.

06:16.880 --> 06:19.160
Admit it, you've lost the trail.

06:24.800 --> 06:27.320
I heard you could handle
yourself in a fight.

06:29.600 --> 06:31.600
- Could?
- Mm.

06:31.640 --> 06:35.880
All those years in the Farlands
might have left you a little... soft.

06:35.920 --> 06:38.480
I can still handle myself.

06:39.920 --> 06:41.920
You look a little soft yourself.

06:41.960 --> 06:45.160
A man becomes Thane all he
has to do is talk a good fight.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.240
It's at least a week old.

06:49.960 --> 06:51.560
A Warig?

06:54.400 --> 06:56.400
Come on!

07:01.240 --> 07:02.840
Faster!

07:13.320 --> 07:14.920
Urgh!

07:16.760 --> 07:19.200
Drop it.

07:19.240 --> 07:21.120
Drop it before you hurt yourself.

07:21.840 --> 07:23.680
Give the man his sword.

07:26.360 --> 07:27.960
Urgh! Uhh!

07:29.120 --> 07:30.760
No.

07:30.800 --> 07:33.080
Watch me talk it to death.

07:34.560 --> 07:36.040
- Come on.
- Yaah!

07:36.080 --> 07:37.600
Ahhh!

07:44.800 --> 07:46.480
Uhhh!

08:00.920 --> 08:03.700
In my tribe, if a man
loses his sword to an enemy,

08:03.725 --> 08:06.480
he's no longer fit to be a warrior.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.120
Really?

08:08.160 --> 08:10.840
We let him walk into the
mountains and die alone.

08:12.240 --> 08:15.560
And what if he loses his
sword to some half-grown Warig?

08:15.600 --> 08:18.400
Ah, then we usually just get it back.

08:18.440 --> 08:20.440
And let him die of shame.

08:42.440 --> 08:44.440
Scorann's men.

08:56.920 --> 08:59.320
- Leave him for me.
- No. Another day.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Slean's not here.

09:04.040 --> 09:06.760
Come. We have no time to lose.

09:14.123 --> 09:16.123
There! She's coming!

09:17.403 --> 09:19.683
- There she is!
- She's here!

09:23.803 --> 09:25.643
The Skinshifter's wife!

09:29.243 --> 09:31.243
Kill! Kill her!

09:36.123 --> 09:39.003
They should stop this
before it gets out of control.

09:43.283 --> 09:45.283
Where are you taking her?

09:45.323 --> 09:49.043
That thing they're keeping in
there, that she calls a husband,

09:49.083 --> 09:51.083
butchered my son!

09:52.363 --> 09:55.243
I am sorry for what happened to your son.

09:55.283 --> 09:57.923
But what Koll did he was forced to do.

09:57.963 --> 09:59.763
He's a good man.

09:59.803 --> 10:01.283
Urghh!

10:03.483 --> 10:04.803
Ma! Ma!

10:04.843 --> 10:06.203
No!

10:06.243 --> 10:07.803
- No!
- Aah!

10:07.843 --> 10:09.563
This isn't right.

10:09.603 --> 10:14.283
The punishment for consorting
with a Skinshifter is death!

10:14.323 --> 10:15.963
Ma!

10:16.003 --> 10:17.963
Only if she knew.

10:18.003 --> 10:20.203
She knew! Didn't you?

10:22.283 --> 10:24.283
You knew!

10:24.323 --> 10:26.363
Deny it.

10:27.443 --> 10:29.163
I deny it.

10:29.203 --> 10:31.203
I never knew.

10:31.243 --> 10:33.523
Say it. What is he?

10:35.283 --> 10:37.283
A filthy Mudborn.

10:38.483 --> 10:40.083
Louder!

10:40.123 --> 10:42.923
A filthy Mudborn!

10:44.363 --> 10:46.163
A killer!

10:46.203 --> 10:48.803
Who deceived me and my daughter!

10:52.043 --> 10:54.243
Stand aside! Move!

10:57.403 --> 10:59.403
What do you think you're doing?

10:59.443 --> 11:01.043
My orders...

11:02.043 --> 11:05.443
... were for you to bring
this woman safely to me.

11:06.843 --> 11:09.963
Not stand aside and watch
as she is torn apart!

11:12.523 --> 11:14.243
No!

11:14.283 --> 11:18.163
I claim this woman's life
for the life of my son.

11:20.443 --> 11:23.323
Rheda, I would willingly give her my life.

11:23.363 --> 11:25.883
It means nothing to me any more.

11:28.043 --> 11:30.043
But I still have a daughter.

11:31.243 --> 11:34.363
It still has value to her. Please?

11:38.563 --> 11:40.563
Your people want her dead.

11:43.123 --> 11:45.123
But I need her alive.

11:45.163 --> 11:48.163
Or I'll never know who the
Skinshifter was acting for.

11:51.883 --> 11:54.283
This woman has a right to make her case.

11:54.323 --> 11:56.323
At trial.

12:00.603 --> 12:02.603
Have her brought to my chambers.

12:04.123 --> 12:06.323
What?

12:33.843 --> 12:35.153
In my tribe, she would have been cut

12:35.317 --> 12:38.243
down the moment that thing was revealed.

12:38.283 --> 12:40.403
Different tribes, different laws.

12:42.323 --> 12:45.003
Your loyalty to your
sister is quite touching.

12:45.043 --> 12:47.043
But, if you were back in Bregan,

12:47.083 --> 12:49.683
would you, as its Thane,
countenance a trial,

12:49.723 --> 12:53.323
for someone who slept between
the same sheets as a Skinshifter?

12:55.123 --> 12:56.723
No.

12:56.763 --> 12:58.963
But we're not in Bregan. Are we?

13:01.123 --> 13:02.523
Hey.

13:05.123 --> 13:09.443
If Scorann isn't here for the vote,
your sister might be in trouble.

13:12.443 --> 13:14.443
Don't underestimate her.

13:17.883 --> 13:20.683
A little early in the day
for that, don't you think?

13:24.123 --> 13:26.189
As Thane, I can show you mercy, but, if

13:26.214 --> 13:28.203
I'm to do that, you must help me now.

13:28.243 --> 13:30.243
I knew nothing of what Koll was.

13:30.283 --> 13:32.283
- Who did he act for?
- I don't know.

13:32.323 --> 13:33.341
- Sylvi... 
- I swear it!

13:33.366 --> 13:35.027
I think she speaks the truth.

13:37.683 --> 13:39.963
If you don't help me...

13:40.003 --> 13:44.243
Rheda, when others doubted
your becoming Thane,

13:44.283 --> 13:46.283
I spoke out for you.

13:46.323 --> 13:48.323
I would never lie.

13:48.363 --> 13:50.283
Not to you.

14:17.043 --> 14:20.243
This isn't about a ransom.
They're being paid to take me.

14:34.603 --> 14:36.603
Isen!

14:40.043 --> 14:41.643
Move!

14:49.523 --> 14:51.523
The embers are warm.

15:05.363 --> 15:07.363
You think they have Slean, too?

15:09.843 --> 15:11.777
It doesn't strike you
as convenient that your

15:11.778 --> 15:14.947
brother vanishes on the
eve of the Gathering?

15:16.443 --> 15:18.443
Convenient for who?

15:20.203 --> 15:22.603
For anyone who wants
Rheda to lose the vote.

15:23.683 --> 15:26.363
You assume Scorann would
cast his vote for her.

15:27.083 --> 15:30.963
But he has the sense to see the
Shieldlands need a strong leader.

15:32.643 --> 15:34.643
And that would be you?

15:36.563 --> 15:38.563
At what price?

15:38.603 --> 15:40.603
For the good of all?

15:40.643 --> 15:42.843
Whatever price need be paid.

15:44.163 --> 15:46.163
The life of a brother?

15:54.443 --> 15:56.443
Aaah! Urgh!

15:56.483 --> 15:58.163
Uhh.

16:00.563 --> 16:02.163
Get up!

16:02.203 --> 16:03.963
My ankle.

16:05.483 --> 16:07.003
Now!

16:08.483 --> 16:09.963
Urgh.

16:12.643 --> 16:14.203
Move!

16:22.123 --> 16:24.123
Don't let them get away!

16:26.003 --> 16:29.041
They're getting away! Move it! Come on!

16:31.883 --> 16:33.203
Jump!

16:36.723 --> 16:38.097
You could have told me you were

16:38.122 --> 16:39.603
- going to do that!
- I didn't know.

16:39.643 --> 16:41.323
You're enjoying this.

16:43.203 --> 16:44.843
Sssh-sssh-sssh!

16:46.603 --> 16:48.603
Spread out!

16:50.003 --> 16:52.003
Come on, move on!

17:00.283 --> 17:01.883
Aaah!

17:07.123 --> 17:08.723
Hold him!

17:09.723 --> 17:11.723
Aaah...

17:26.323 --> 17:27.923
Let's go.

17:36.723 --> 17:39.323
The ankle, how is it?

17:41.323 --> 17:43.323
I didn't know you cared.

17:44.443 --> 17:46.243
- Aaah!
- Scorann!

17:46.283 --> 17:48.283
Uhh... Uhh...

17:55.123 --> 17:59.923
Your new Thane gives a Skinshifter
a bed and its wife a trial!

18:01.483 --> 18:05.563
Next, she'll have Mudborn at
your tables, drinking your mead!

18:07.843 --> 18:09.843
Perhaps Hrothgar made a mistake

18:09.883 --> 18:14.043
in over-looking his son and
appointing his wife as Thane!

18:17.123 --> 18:21.043
The laws of Herot were laid
down under my husband's rule,

18:21.083 --> 18:23.203
but they will be followed under mine.

18:23.243 --> 18:26.723
Though you have to wonder
whose hand were they written in.

18:26.763 --> 18:29.523
We're not here to discuss
my husband, but hers.

18:31.083 --> 18:34.603
And, despite your rank, I
would ask you remember that.

18:45.843 --> 18:50.323
If I judge you guilty,
your life is the smelter's.

18:50.363 --> 18:52.363
That is the law.

19:00.403 --> 19:02.403
Did you know what your husband was?

19:02.443 --> 19:04.763
No.

19:06.843 --> 19:10.123
Eight summers ago, I
had a child with a man.

19:10.163 --> 19:11.763
He...

19:11.803 --> 19:14.003
He used to beat us.

19:14.043 --> 19:16.123
Koll saved us.

19:17.403 --> 19:19.763
He took my daughter as his own.

19:21.763 --> 19:23.963
We came back to my home, here, to Herot,

19:24.003 --> 19:26.003
but I never knew what he was.

19:26.043 --> 19:28.043
I never did!

19:29.723 --> 19:32.923
I believed in the good man I saw.

19:34.003 --> 19:36.203
Not the creature that was hidden.

19:37.483 --> 19:41.255
How is it possible to lie with a man every

19:41.280 --> 19:44.763
night for years and not know who he is?

19:44.803 --> 19:50.803
I lay with my son's father one night
and I knew he was a good-for-nothing!

19:54.763 --> 19:56.563
May I speak on Sylvi's part?

19:59.643 --> 20:01.363
Quiet!

20:01.403 --> 20:03.683
Let her speak.

20:07.603 --> 20:09.603
Sixtan, you baked Koll's bread.

20:10.923 --> 20:14.203
And you... You brought
him food in this hall.

20:15.563 --> 20:17.763
You took his money when he lost at dice.

20:18.923 --> 20:20.923
We all made him welcome.

20:20.963 --> 20:22.963
None of us knew.

20:24.763 --> 20:29.083
This man was appointed by Hrothgar
to help Bayen keep the law.

20:29.123 --> 20:31.123
If he was fooled,

20:31.163 --> 20:34.003
then what chance that this humble,

20:34.043 --> 20:37.243
untutored woman would know any different?

20:40.123 --> 20:44.443
Would you really have Rheda
make this child an orphan

20:44.483 --> 20:47.083
for a mistake of which we're all guilty?

20:49.443 --> 20:51.723
We are on trial here.

20:51.763 --> 20:53.763
As much as her mother.

20:57.283 --> 20:59.483
Make your judgment and be done.

20:59.523 --> 21:01.523
Yes!

21:06.203 --> 21:08.203
Make a decision!

21:13.723 --> 21:15.923
Have the child brought to my chambers.

21:17.683 --> 21:19.283
Where is she going?

21:19.323 --> 21:23.643
Wait. Rheda wishes to
take counsel with me first.

21:26.843 --> 21:28.843
Give your judgement now!

21:28.883 --> 21:31.443
You find the woman innocent?

21:33.283 --> 21:35.283
Elvina spoke well.

21:35.323 --> 21:37.202
Lucky, because I don't think you'd

21:37.227 --> 21:39.427
have had it in you to have her executed.

21:40.963 --> 21:42.963
The law must be upheld.

21:43.003 --> 21:45.003
Yeah.

21:45.043 --> 21:47.043
Pretty words.

21:47.083 --> 21:49.083
Pretty mouth.

21:50.763 --> 21:52.763
You're drunk.

21:54.363 --> 21:56.363
If Scorann doesn't arrive...

21:57.443 --> 21:59.443
... your future will be in my hands.

22:05.083 --> 22:07.043
We're old friends.

22:07.083 --> 22:09.283
How can I help you make up your mind?

22:13.123 --> 22:15.123
Hrothgar was a great warrior.

22:17.563 --> 22:21.883
But... could he have led, as well,
without your words in his ear?

22:21.923 --> 22:23.923
Then you know I can lead.

22:23.963 --> 22:25.963
I know you can counsel a leader.

22:27.883 --> 22:30.883
But this trial shows you are naive.

22:33.123 --> 22:35.123
Your people don't want justice.

22:36.723 --> 22:38.723
They want to see strength.

22:40.563 --> 22:42.683
- And they want blood.
- I know my people.

22:44.123 --> 22:46.123
I should get back to them now.

22:48.283 --> 22:50.283
I could lead.

22:50.323 --> 22:52.323
And you could counsel.

22:54.523 --> 22:56.523
As my wife.

22:57.603 --> 22:59.603
Your bed must be cold.

23:05.123 --> 23:07.443
Hrothgar was my husband.

23:07.483 --> 23:09.483
I'll not take another.

23:15.803 --> 23:18.603
- I'd be a good husband to you.
- You should leave now.

23:19.683 --> 23:22.483
You will take me, because you need me.

23:22.523 --> 23:24.443
And because I... I've...

23:24.483 --> 23:26.963
always, always... wanted you.

23:33.923 --> 23:35.923
Unless you want to leave here...

23:37.123 --> 23:39.123
... carrying your guts,

23:39.163 --> 23:41.163
step away.

23:44.683 --> 23:46.683
Then you will lose all this.

23:48.403 --> 23:50.603
- My Thane?
- I told you to wait!

23:55.123 --> 23:56.723
My mistake.

23:59.603 --> 24:01.163
Get out.

24:32.123 --> 24:34.123
Thank you.

24:39.803 --> 24:41.803
Erm... The girl.

24:44.603 --> 24:46.603
When you're ready.

24:59.854 --> 25:01.854
You served a Thane like me?

25:01.894 --> 25:05.294
There are no Thanes in the lands
I come from, only an Emperor.

25:08.254 --> 25:10.654
- You were in his guard?
- I was its master.

25:11.854 --> 25:13.454
Uhh.

25:18.614 --> 25:21.574
The Outcasts, where are they headed?

25:21.614 --> 25:23.614
Speak and I'll finish you cleanly.

25:23.654 --> 25:26.454
Hold your tongue and we'll
leave you for the trolls.

25:26.494 --> 25:28.544
They'll have finished with
those Wisdeth guards by now.

25:28.569 --> 25:30.518
Be along for you soon.

25:31.654 --> 25:33.654
Ramin's Tomb.

25:34.974 --> 25:37.574
We're to hold Scorann
there, until tomorrow.

25:37.614 --> 25:39.614
After the Gathering.

25:39.654 --> 25:41.654
Who are you working for?

25:42.934 --> 25:47.934
A man named Vlade will come and
pay us. That's all we were told.

25:51.694 --> 25:53.294
Torr!

25:56.174 --> 25:57.974
Where is he?

25:58.014 --> 26:00.814
You want to go back and
look for him? Do it yourself.

26:05.734 --> 26:07.734
One less share to worry about.

26:08.734 --> 26:10.534
Move!

26:11.654 --> 26:13.254
Aah.

26:18.254 --> 26:20.254
What's wrong?

26:23.654 --> 26:25.654
Nothing.

26:34.974 --> 26:37.094
I know you're scared. It's all right.

26:42.174 --> 26:44.454
I think we're all a bit scared right now.

26:51.734 --> 26:53.814
I need you to help me with something.

26:56.414 --> 26:58.414
You know your da is in trouble.

27:00.054 --> 27:02.254
You'd like this to stop, wouldn't you?

27:08.654 --> 27:10.654
Well, it won't.

27:11.974 --> 27:13.974
Even if I let your da go...

27:15.494 --> 27:17.494
... people will see him

27:17.534 --> 27:20.534
and they'll say, "That's
the man from Herot."

27:21.534 --> 27:23.534
And you'll never be safe.

27:24.534 --> 27:26.734
They'll see his face

27:26.774 --> 27:28.774
and they'll know.

27:28.814 --> 27:32.214
- And they'll come after you.
- But he could change! He could...

27:35.654 --> 27:37.654
Change into a Skinshifter.

27:40.334 --> 27:42.334
It was a secret, wasn't it?

27:47.054 --> 27:49.054
Your ma said never tell.

27:49.094 --> 27:51.094
People wouldn't understand.

27:52.054 --> 27:54.054
But I do understand.

28:21.454 --> 28:24.454
What is this? Do you
want to get paid or not?

28:24.494 --> 28:26.494
- Move it!
- Hurry up!

28:27.494 --> 28:29.494
Move yourselves!

28:48.534 --> 28:51.934
Your brother and Slean could
get killed in the confusion.

28:51.974 --> 28:54.174
Unless that's what you to happen?

28:55.374 --> 28:59.174
If that's what I wanted, he'd
see my face before he died.

29:05.654 --> 29:07.454
The jewellery.

29:07.494 --> 29:09.294
Give it to me.

29:09.334 --> 29:11.334
It's not jewellery.

29:13.614 --> 29:15.414
Why?

29:15.454 --> 29:16.894
Uhh.

29:18.454 --> 29:20.454
Clean up your leg.

29:22.014 --> 29:24.214
Who is it that wants to make some money?

29:27.254 --> 29:29.054
Uhh.

29:29.094 --> 29:30.574
Axel!

29:32.854 --> 29:34.854
Oh-ho, yeah!

29:41.334 --> 29:42.894
Come on!

29:50.134 --> 29:52.094
That's Hrothgar's blade, isn't it?

29:52.654 --> 29:54.654
He gave it to you?

29:59.534 --> 30:01.614
I had to take it out of his dead hands.

30:01.654 --> 30:05.894
He may have made Rheda Thane, but
who else could he give that to?

30:05.934 --> 30:07.934
Beowulf.

30:13.454 --> 30:15.454
He's back.

30:15.494 --> 30:19.094
I heard that, even as a boy,
he had a way with killing.

30:20.974 --> 30:22.774
There's none better.

30:23.774 --> 30:25.254
Urghh!

30:34.534 --> 30:36.534
You have Scorann?

30:39.494 --> 30:41.574
Who are you?

30:41.614 --> 30:43.214
Vlade?

30:48.214 --> 30:50.848
- Where's the coin?
- You'll get it.

31:03.054 --> 31:05.334
- How did this happen?
- An accident.

31:15.774 --> 31:17.534
Let's talk price.

31:17.574 --> 31:19.574
It was agreed.

31:22.294 --> 31:24.294
Beowulf?

31:37.054 --> 31:39.054
We agreed coin.

31:41.454 --> 31:43.454
You, fetch Axel.

31:43.494 --> 31:46.294
What are you waiting for?
Tell him Vlade is here.

31:46.334 --> 31:47.934
Axel!

31:48.894 --> 31:50.494
Axel!

32:17.254 --> 32:19.054
- Uhh!
- Come on!

32:19.094 --> 32:21.094
I'll catch my breath.

32:22.334 --> 32:25.054
Go ahead, find that precious sword.

32:40.214 --> 32:42.214
Uh. Aah.

32:56.174 --> 32:58.487
Why?

32:59.654 --> 33:02.054
My sons will be farmers.

33:02.094 --> 33:05.334
And they will breed with farmers.

33:05.374 --> 33:07.654
And they will rule farmers.

33:08.814 --> 33:10.273
And they will be happy with that,

33:10.274 --> 33:13.158
because that is all
they have ever known.

33:15.414 --> 33:17.414
But I was born a warrior

33:17.454 --> 33:19.454
and I'll die one.

33:55.214 --> 33:57.054
- Yaaa-aah!
- Ah!

33:57.094 --> 33:58.574
Aaah...

34:03.094 --> 34:04.654
Uhh.

34:06.494 --> 34:08.494
- Vlade?
- Dead.

34:10.333 --> 34:12.534
- My brother?
- In the tombs.

34:41.014 --> 34:43.014
Rate...

34:50.813 --> 34:55.310
Beowulf, few men live
up to their reputation.

34:55.813 --> 34:57.614
You are one of them.

34:57.654 --> 34:59.654
There's no time for this.

34:59.694 --> 35:01.774
Still jealous of my praise, brother?

35:01.814 --> 35:04.854
You don't have long.
Scorann, give me your vote.

35:05.934 --> 35:07.934
Your concern is touching.

35:07.974 --> 35:09.974
Speak the words.

35:12.614 --> 35:14.614
These are my words.

35:16.694 --> 35:19.174
Rheda shall keep peace in the Shieldlands.

35:20.254 --> 35:23.716
- You hunger for war.
- We're blood.

35:26.054 --> 35:28.054
I am a Varni

35:28.094 --> 35:30.094
and you are my brother.

35:32.374 --> 35:34.374
But I was Thane of the Wisdeth.

35:35.454 --> 35:37.454
And Rheda will protect them.

35:38.534 --> 35:41.804
- My vote goes to her.
- You can't do this.

35:43.334 --> 35:45.334
There's a condition.

36:05.094 --> 36:06.694
No.

36:06.734 --> 36:08.734
Let him rest.

36:11.254 --> 36:13.254
This was his place of glory.

36:34.654 --> 36:36.195
- Scorann?
- He's dead.

36:36.196 --> 36:38.134
How? When I left him, he was...

36:38.174 --> 36:41.174
It wasn't your fault. He
chose the time and the place.

36:47.054 --> 36:49.254
Then you came for nothing.

36:49.294 --> 36:51.294
No.

36:51.334 --> 36:53.334
I came for you.

37:25.845 --> 37:28.125
You said you didn't know his true nature.

37:28.165 --> 37:30.405
But that was a lie.

37:30.445 --> 37:32.925
You knew what you married.

37:32.965 --> 37:34.525
No. I...

37:34.565 --> 37:36.805
Your daughter told me.

37:36.845 --> 37:38.845
There we are!

37:46.565 --> 37:48.565
I loved him.

37:48.605 --> 37:50.885
I knew what he was.

37:50.925 --> 37:53.405
And I didn't care. Is that so wrong?

37:58.485 --> 38:00.765
The sentence is death.

38:02.845 --> 38:05.845
To be carried out immediately
by the smelter's hand.

38:10.966 --> 38:14.165
- I underestimated you.
- It's the law.

38:17.485 --> 38:19.085
Quiet!

38:19.125 --> 38:20.725
Sylvi.

38:22.725 --> 38:24.725
I can't help you now.

38:24.765 --> 38:27.805
But if you tell me who made
Koll do the things he did,

38:27.845 --> 38:31.165
then I will make sure your
child is well looked after.

38:31.205 --> 38:33.205
He didn't tell me.

38:33.245 --> 38:36.245
All he ever wanted was to protect us.

38:38.845 --> 38:40.645
No.

38:42.725 --> 38:45.525
And you call the Mudborn beasts!

38:47.685 --> 38:50.485
No, Ma! No, no! No, Ma!

38:57.845 --> 38:59.845
Wake up.

39:01.325 --> 39:03.325
Wake up!

39:04.925 --> 39:06.925
Not so scary in your cage now.

39:07.209 --> 39:10.005
Give us a show.

39:11.685 --> 39:13.685
What do you think I am? A freak?

39:13.725 --> 39:15.525
What else?

39:15.565 --> 39:19.725
When your ancestors were living
in caves in the Farlands...

39:21.085 --> 39:23.485
... my bloodline were priests

39:23.525 --> 39:27.125
to the giant-kings that ruled here.

39:27.165 --> 39:28.925
Hm...

39:31.125 --> 39:34.445
We walked this black earth like princes!

39:37.085 --> 39:39.485
Rheda just sentenced your wife...

39:40.565 --> 39:42.565
... to death.

39:43.845 --> 39:45.845
Make you mad?

40:25.845 --> 40:27.845
Run!

40:37.605 --> 40:39.205
Go!

40:39.245 --> 40:41.245
Leave! Don't look back.

40:45.325 --> 40:47.325
Uhh!

40:52.805 --> 40:54.805
Come. Come.

40:55.885 --> 40:57.885
Get her inside. Get her inside.

40:58.965 --> 41:00.965
Where's his wife?

41:45.565 --> 41:49.165
I called off the search
for Sylvi and the child.

41:51.565 --> 41:53.565
The Gathering is in the morning.

42:02.565 --> 42:05.365
- My son?
- Lives.

42:05.405 --> 42:07.285
And Scorann?

42:07.325 --> 42:09.525
My brother is dead.

42:10.605 --> 42:12.605
Where is Slean?

42:18.645 --> 42:20.645
You killed the Skinshifter.

42:25.605 --> 42:28.605
Now it can't tell us who
set this all in motion.

42:30.845 --> 42:32.845
I suppose not.

42:32.885 --> 42:36.685
But what if someone knew the
man who tried to ransom Scorann?

42:38.885 --> 42:40.885
Remembered his name.

42:40.925 --> 42:42.925
From years ago.

42:46.845 --> 42:48.845
All through the ride home...

42:48.885 --> 42:50.885
I couldn't bring it to mind.

42:50.925 --> 42:52.925
Where I knew him from.

42:55.605 --> 42:57.605
But then I remembered.

42:58.685 --> 43:00.685
From when I was a boy.

43:01.765 --> 43:03.765
When I came to Bregan.

43:03.805 --> 43:06.925
To visit you and to see the
Whale Road for the first time.

43:09.605 --> 43:11.605
Vlade was your man.

43:16.445 --> 43:18.445
You're behind all this.

43:19.565 --> 43:21.214
You wanted to be Jarl, but you didn't want

43:21.215 --> 43:23.869
to be seen to betray your own sister.

43:26.725 --> 43:28.725
It almost worked.

43:40.445 --> 43:42.445
And what now?

43:49.503 --> 43:52.085
Slean!

44:02.445 --> 44:04.445
Your uncle saved my life today.

44:04.485 --> 44:06.485
Did he? Really?

44:07.565 --> 44:10.045
The Skinshifter's woman, did she talk?

44:12.445 --> 44:14.662
Then we're no closer to knowing
who was behind its actions.

44:14.663 --> 44:17.805
Or the taking of Scorann.

44:18.645 --> 44:20.645
I'm sure the truth will out.

44:29.925 --> 44:34.165
I lay my claim to become Jarl of all
the Shieldlands before this Gathering.

44:34.205 --> 44:36.085
Is this a joke?

44:37.725 --> 44:39.472
- Next time...
- The next time we meet,

44:39.473 --> 44:41.418
it'll be as enemies.

44:42.645 --> 44:45.165
- Do you see something?
- It's nothing.

44:45.205 --> 44:47.325
The Warig, what are they like?

44:47.365 --> 44:49.445
Ugly, stupid and brutal.

44:49.485 --> 44:53.165
Out there, the Warig would cut us down
before we even got a hundred yards!

44:53.205 --> 44:56.085
If you're ever going to be a warrior,
this is what it's about.

44:56.125 --> 44:57.285
Aaah!
