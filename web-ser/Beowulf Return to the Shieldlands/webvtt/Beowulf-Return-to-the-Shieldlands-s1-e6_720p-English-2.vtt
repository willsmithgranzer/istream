00:02.660 --> 00:06.168
You'll go to Mere. Collect my
son's bride. Take Elvina with you.

00:06.208 --> 00:08.368
- Why?
- She knows their ways.

00:08.408 --> 00:11.328
My mother wants to drive us apart.
That's why she is sending you.

00:11.368 --> 00:14.088
I've seen you look at
Elvina and her at you.

00:14.128 --> 00:15.808
It's not the way she looks at my son.

00:15.848 --> 00:17.328
- Sand wryms!
- Run!

00:20.448 --> 00:22.695
- You're alive.
- Abrecan is impatient to know if

00:22.720 --> 00:25.088
you'll help him become
Jarl of the Shieldlands.

00:25.128 --> 00:27.688
She'll not give you what you want. I can.

00:27.728 --> 00:30.448
The Warig. Their war
bands are coming together.

00:33.848 --> 00:36.168
This time, they mean to destroy us.

00:36.208 --> 00:37.608
All of us.

00:37.648 --> 00:40.288
I have a daughter to bury.

00:40.328 --> 00:42.928
You will release me, so
I can be Slean's bride.

00:43.488 --> 00:46.168
- Does your support for Rheda stand?
- It does.

00:59.048 --> 01:02.368
Aaah!

01:19.688 --> 01:21.888
Aaah! Aaah-ah!

01:24.728 --> 01:26.728
Aaah! Aaah!

01:36.568 --> 01:38.568
Look at you now!

01:40.248 --> 01:44.048
Pig filth, scut for brains! You
should have learned to climb!

01:49.768 --> 01:52.328
Aaah! Aaah! Aaah!

02:05.888 --> 02:07.888
Fixed you, didn't I? Eh?

02:08.967 --> 02:10.967
That'll show you.

02:11.008 --> 02:13.008
You and all your kind.

03:00.368 --> 03:02.368
War is coming.

03:02.408 --> 03:04.208
Says who?

03:04.248 --> 03:07.928
Gorrik, Thane of the Mere. He
thinks the Warig are rising up again.

03:07.968 --> 03:10.848
If they do, we go to Mere,
stand with them and fight.

03:10.888 --> 03:14.368
It's not just Mere. We were
attacked by Warig in the Edgelands.

03:14.408 --> 03:17.328
They haven't attacked
farmers there for 20 summers.

03:18.288 --> 03:21.608
If war comes to the Shieldlands,
they'll want to take Herot.

03:21.648 --> 03:23.968
We're not prepared for an attack.

03:24.008 --> 03:28.328
There used to be a stake wall,
guard towers every 40 paces.

03:28.368 --> 03:30.551
Now there's a handful of spars by the

03:30.576 --> 03:32.848
main gate and a few Huskarla standing.

03:32.888 --> 03:34.488
Then fix it!

03:34.528 --> 03:36.528
And bring my new daughter to me.

03:38.008 --> 03:41.088
I agreed to this marriage
to strengthen the tribes.

03:41.128 --> 03:44.888
If war lies ahead, then we'll all
be thankful for it. Even Slean.

03:46.328 --> 03:50.328
So, tell me, this Mara, what's she like?

03:52.328 --> 03:56.488
She died. Sea fever. Elvina
did everything she could.

03:56.528 --> 03:58.528
What?

04:00.368 --> 04:02.888
- This is all for nothing?
- No. Not for nothing.

04:02.928 --> 04:04.728
We have a bride.

04:04.768 --> 04:06.568
Just not Mara.

04:06.608 --> 04:09.408
Her name is Kela, Gorrik's second daughter.

04:31.488 --> 04:33.688
Are you so impatient to see your bride?

04:33.728 --> 04:35.528
I'm impatient to see you.

04:40.128 --> 04:43.608
This marriage, it changes
nothing of how I feel for you.

04:43.648 --> 04:45.648
It changes everything.

04:45.688 --> 04:47.488
In form only.

04:47.528 --> 04:50.728
It doesn't change who I
love or who I take to my bed.

05:28.048 --> 05:30.048
She looks after me.

05:31.128 --> 05:33.128
You don't have to be afraid.

05:34.808 --> 05:36.808
Everyone here is your friend.

05:40.368 --> 05:44.008
What does it matter where I was?
I'm back and I've work to do.

05:45.088 --> 05:47.488
- With that arm?
- I told you, it's nothing.

05:47.528 --> 05:49.848
- How will you work like that?
- I'll manage.

05:51.248 --> 05:54.368
- It's just a scratch.
- That 'scratch' came from an arrow!

05:56.008 --> 05:58.014
She was with you, wasn't she?

05:58.039 --> 05:59.808
- You let her get hurt!
- It wasn't my fault.

05:59.848 --> 06:01.848
- She's just a child!
- I'm not a child!

06:01.888 --> 06:05.408
So just leave him alone. Breca
couldn't have done anything!

06:06.248 --> 06:09.848
People died and it was my fault.
Is that what you want to hear?

06:46.568 --> 06:48.568
Step forward in peace.

07:06.448 --> 07:08.448
I am Kela of the Mere.

07:09.528 --> 07:13.848
From my father and my tribe, I
bring you greetings of good faith.

07:13.888 --> 07:15.888
I am Rheda of Herot.

07:15.928 --> 07:18.328
You are most welcome in my home.

07:18.368 --> 07:21.128
I'm sorry also for your loss.

07:22.328 --> 07:24.128
Thank you.

07:24.168 --> 07:25.968
Come.

07:26.008 --> 07:28.208
This is your betrothed.

07:29.208 --> 07:31.008
My son Slean.

07:32.008 --> 07:35.248
This marriage will
strengthen both our peoples.

07:35.288 --> 07:38.728
But, more than that, I hope
you will be happy together.

07:40.568 --> 07:42.568
Tell us about your home.

07:42.608 --> 07:44.848
It must be very different for you here.

07:44.888 --> 07:47.208
You certainly have more gold than we do.

07:47.248 --> 07:49.438
We also have iron. Herot makes the best

07:49.463 --> 07:51.848
weapons in the land, as your father knows.

07:51.888 --> 07:55.368
He was pleased with the dowry
you sent. Mere is well armed now.

07:55.408 --> 07:58.928
I hear that the Warig have been
causing your father some concern,

07:58.968 --> 08:00.968
that he fears they may be rising again.

08:01.008 --> 08:03.150
They killed my mother, slaughtered our

08:03.175 --> 08:05.152
people and no-one came to our aid.

08:06.288 --> 08:08.608
For years, they've kept their distance.

08:08.648 --> 08:12.808
Now they're back. They have a
leader, 'a prophet' they call him.

08:12.848 --> 08:14.953
And he tells them the time has come to

08:14.978 --> 08:17.328
wash the Shieldlands clean with red blood.

08:17.368 --> 08:19.088
Not whilst Herot rules.

08:19.128 --> 08:20.728
You're safe here.

08:22.688 --> 08:24.688
Slean, ride for Bregan.

08:25.768 --> 08:28.048
Tell Abrecan of this Warig prophet.

08:29.048 --> 08:31.528
If they are turning, we'll need our allies.

08:32.607 --> 08:34.328
Come.

08:55.648 --> 08:57.248
Stood there.

09:00.248 --> 09:02.768
Abrecan, there's something you should see.

09:03.848 --> 09:05.408
Alone.

09:25.808 --> 09:29.547
- So, where does Slean's loyalties lie?
- With your sister.

09:30.208 --> 09:34.008
The marriage she arranged to the
girl from the Mere. He'll honour it.

09:34.048 --> 09:36.168
He seems determined to be a loyal son.

09:38.528 --> 09:40.528
And yet he let you go.

09:40.568 --> 09:42.368
Why kill the messenger?

09:42.408 --> 09:46.248
He knows you were behind it all,
killing Bayen, Scorann's death.

09:46.288 --> 09:48.384
Scorann was never meant to die, was he?

09:48.409 --> 09:50.032
Do you think Rheda will care?

09:51.848 --> 09:53.848
If I were you, I'd watch your back.

10:20.888 --> 10:22.888
This has got away from me.

10:25.048 --> 10:30.248
You realise that all Slean has
to do is tell Rheda of your deeds

10:30.288 --> 10:32.288
and you lose everything.

10:32.328 --> 10:36.328
If Slean wanted to destroy me, he
would have done so at the Gathering.

10:38.648 --> 10:41.928
Instead, he pinned the blame on the Varni.

10:41.968 --> 10:45.608
He's a man whose ambition is
at war with his conscience.

10:46.688 --> 10:48.688
And that's useful to me.

10:49.928 --> 10:54.488
For now. He knows Herot and
its ways and I can use that.

11:25.608 --> 11:27.608
I know that look.

11:27.648 --> 11:29.093
- You do?
- What happened before,

11:29.118 --> 11:30.488
we should try to leave it.

11:30.528 --> 11:32.008
Why?

11:33.008 --> 11:35.008
I know you're not in love with Slean.

11:35.048 --> 11:36.576
Slean has nothing to do with you

11:36.601 --> 11:38.272
- and me.
- So there is a you and me?

11:47.008 --> 11:48.608
I knew it.

11:55.008 --> 11:57.156
- Stop this, both of you.
- I turn

11:57.181 --> 11:59.448
my back and you take my woman!

11:59.488 --> 12:01.088
Please!

12:13.608 --> 12:15.608
Shall we go back inside?

12:19.408 --> 12:21.408
Have you lost your minds?

12:53.128 --> 12:55.728
- What's going on?
- Nothing's going on.

12:55.768 --> 12:58.528
I'm riding to Bregan as you instructed.

12:58.568 --> 13:00.568
We need our allies, remember?

13:02.648 --> 13:04.648
It's done. It's over.

13:06.008 --> 13:08.288
Which is what you wanted.

13:08.328 --> 13:11.288
- What does that mean?
- Beowulf and Elvina together.

13:11.328 --> 13:14.528
Is that why you sent them
off to the Mere without me?

13:14.568 --> 13:16.288
Not exactly, no.

13:16.328 --> 13:19.928
Just a happy coincidence for you,
then? But I don't believe that.

13:20.928 --> 13:23.248
Whatever I have, you find a way to take it!

13:32.328 --> 13:34.328
Slean, wait!

13:38.408 --> 13:41.808
Do you even understand the
meaning of the word 'discretion'?

13:41.848 --> 13:44.156
It's taken weeks for him to come around.

13:44.181 --> 13:46.408
All of it undone. All of it worthless.

13:46.448 --> 13:49.528
Is it my fault your son finds
offence wherever he looks?

13:49.568 --> 13:51.168
A troll!

13:51.208 --> 13:54.208
Attacked me. Tried to kill me.

13:54.248 --> 13:56.048
Where?

13:56.088 --> 14:00.608
In the forest, right on the edge
of our claim, by the old workings.

14:00.648 --> 14:03.617
We need protection. It's
not safe out there. You're

14:03.642 --> 14:06.528
supposed to be looking
after us. That's the deal.

14:06.568 --> 14:09.168
- Where is the troll now?
- It's dead.

14:11.008 --> 14:13.408
- I killed it.
- You killed it?

14:13.448 --> 14:15.328
I didn't exactly mean to.

14:15.368 --> 14:17.795
When they find out that a
man has killed one of their

14:17.820 --> 14:20.088
own, they'll slaughter
every miner they can find.

14:20.128 --> 14:21.728
And then...

14:21.768 --> 14:23.768
they'll come for us.

14:29.643 --> 14:31.643
But why did it attack you?

14:31.683 --> 14:34.563
How should I know? Normally,
they just leave us be.

14:34.603 --> 14:36.883
We mind our business, they mind theirs.

14:36.923 --> 14:38.923
You must have done something.

14:38.963 --> 14:40.963
I'm telling you, it just...

14:41.003 --> 14:43.323
It came at me like it was mad or something.

14:43.363 --> 14:45.363
Hey. Hey.

14:58.843 --> 15:02.323
He doesn't look like he's after
vengeance for his dead friend.

15:02.363 --> 15:04.163
I know.

15:04.203 --> 15:06.203
He's happy.

15:07.883 --> 15:09.883
What's that?

15:09.923 --> 15:11.523
Salt.

15:11.563 --> 15:14.683
We put it out. It keeps 'em placid.

15:19.163 --> 15:21.163
Trolls are mountainborn.

15:21.203 --> 15:24.883
If they can't get salt from the
rock, they'll get it from red blood.

15:24.923 --> 15:26.923
Yeah? Right.

15:26.963 --> 15:28.963
Are you sure you put yours out?

15:29.003 --> 15:31.003
Of course I did.

15:31.043 --> 15:33.043
I'm not an idiot.

15:33.083 --> 15:34.683
This way.

15:34.723 --> 15:36.723
I'll show you the one I killed.

15:51.643 --> 15:53.843
I don't think you killed it enough.

15:53.883 --> 15:55.883
It... It was there. It was dead.

15:56.963 --> 15:59.763
It was a figment of your
imagination, more likely.

15:59.803 --> 16:01.803
- Had you been drinking?
- No.

16:03.203 --> 16:06.723
Well, yeah, yeah, but I swear,
right, it tried to climb the tree.

16:06.763 --> 16:09.083
- But then I... I got...
- You killed it. Right.

16:11.163 --> 16:13.163
Drinking what, exactly?

16:15.163 --> 16:17.643
We can't have come all
this way for nothing.

16:18.723 --> 16:20.723
- I'm thirsty.
- Yes!

16:20.763 --> 16:22.763
Follow me.

16:44.843 --> 16:47.443
Should I feel sorry
for the post or for you?

16:47.483 --> 16:49.963
They let you out of
the hall? I'm surprised.

16:50.003 --> 16:52.003
They were distracted.

16:53.363 --> 16:57.083
And... I was curious to
see what happens round here.

16:58.163 --> 17:00.163
They smelt iron.

17:04.762 --> 17:06.762
What did you think of Slean?

17:07.843 --> 17:10.242
I hardly saw him before he left for Bregan.

17:10.282 --> 17:13.203
I can't think of anything
worse than being married,

17:13.242 --> 17:15.242
being in love.

17:16.323 --> 17:18.323
Who said anything about love?

17:19.403 --> 17:21.883
This is about power, that's all.

17:44.163 --> 17:46.363
Everybody's doing some job or another.

17:49.363 --> 17:51.803
- What's mine?
- I don't know.

17:51.843 --> 17:53.843
Marry Slean.

17:53.883 --> 17:55.883
Be a good wife.

17:55.923 --> 17:57.923
That's not a job.

17:57.963 --> 17:59.963
I think you can do what you want.

18:00.003 --> 18:03.683
Vishka! I heard you got on
the wrong end of a Warig.

18:03.723 --> 18:06.543
- Good news travels fast.
- Look at you! I let you out of

18:06.568 --> 18:09.363
my sight just once and you
go get in a proper fight.

18:09.403 --> 18:11.963
Are you all right,
though? It wasn't too bad?

18:12.003 --> 18:14.696
- Elvina fixed it up.
- So, how many did you take down?

18:14.721 --> 18:16.923
Or did they just run at the sight of you?

18:16.963 --> 18:20.043
Brinni, this is Kela of the Mere.

18:20.083 --> 18:22.163
So you're a warrior.

18:22.203 --> 18:25.283
Anything that comes through
that gate has to answer to me.

18:25.323 --> 18:26.723
Really?

18:26.763 --> 18:28.363
You must be good.

18:28.403 --> 18:29.923
Well...

18:30.923 --> 18:32.723
He's not that good.

20:00.363 --> 20:02.363
Vorhelm!

20:03.443 --> 20:05.443
Vorhelm, you lazy drunk!

20:09.163 --> 20:10.963
Hey-hey!

20:11.003 --> 20:13.003
Where the hell have you been?

20:13.043 --> 20:15.243
This is Vorhelm, my brother.

20:15.283 --> 20:17.283
This is Beowulf, the Reeve.

20:17.323 --> 20:19.323
- And I'm Breca.
- Hello.

20:19.363 --> 20:23.083
- Did you sort the troll?
- What troll? You saw it, too?

20:23.123 --> 20:24.923
No, but...

20:24.963 --> 20:26.963
- It's gone.
- Gone?

20:27.003 --> 20:29.003
If it was ever there.

20:29.043 --> 20:31.323
You don't imagine something like that!

20:31.363 --> 20:33.283
Look! Look!

20:33.323 --> 20:35.603
My axe, Beowulf found it.

20:35.643 --> 20:37.443
It's proof!

20:37.483 --> 20:40.003
You might, if you're drinking this stuff.

20:40.043 --> 20:41.883
We brew it ourselves.

20:41.923 --> 20:45.403
- Really?
- Want to try some? It's good stuff.

20:57.643 --> 21:01.123
Rider approaches! Open the gates!

21:12.603 --> 21:14.603
Slean!

21:17.363 --> 21:19.363
Well, well.

21:20.363 --> 21:22.363
This is an unexpected pleasure.

21:24.243 --> 21:26.363
There are matters we need to discuss.

21:29.163 --> 21:31.763
Oh. Er... This is my Saray.

21:31.803 --> 21:33.803
Come inside. Warm yourself.

21:41.123 --> 21:43.403
You have no enemies here, Slean.

21:44.483 --> 21:48.363
I think I should judge that, don't you?

21:57.003 --> 21:59.283
I thought the miners slept in the trees.

21:59.323 --> 22:02.043
Yeah, most folks do. It's
a good way to stay safe.

22:02.083 --> 22:04.203
But, er, you can't brew this up there.

22:05.283 --> 22:07.283
So Vorhelm and me, we risk it.

22:08.363 --> 22:10.585
- What's it made from?
- A kind of root

22:10.610 --> 22:12.683
that looks like a horse's tackle.

22:14.763 --> 22:20.163
Right. You're sure it's not gonna
make us all see invisible trolls?

22:20.203 --> 22:22.483
Eh, eh! It was real. All right?

22:22.523 --> 22:24.523
It... It was real and it was big.

22:25.243 --> 22:27.243
All right, say it was real.

22:27.283 --> 22:30.763
There hasn't been a troll attack
around here in years. Why now?

22:30.803 --> 22:33.203
Sometimes, they go rogue.

22:33.243 --> 22:35.243
Old bulls, mainly.

22:36.323 --> 22:38.123
Did it look old?

22:38.163 --> 22:40.483
How should I know? It looked like a troll.

22:40.523 --> 22:43.323
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You
thought it looked dead.

22:43.363 --> 22:45.363
And then... it wasn't.

22:45.403 --> 22:47.403
Are you sure it was a troll?

22:47.443 --> 22:50.763
You weren't attacked by
a bush or a giant rabbit?

22:54.043 --> 22:56.043
Have there been any other attacks?

22:56.083 --> 22:59.483
- Is something stirring them up?
- Not that we've heard of. Why?

22:59.523 --> 23:01.723
I'm seeing the bottom of this.

23:01.763 --> 23:04.043
The thing about trolls is...

23:04.083 --> 23:06.523
you rub along with them all right.

23:06.563 --> 23:09.243
You keep to your mine,
they keep to their woods.

23:10.323 --> 23:13.403
You put the salt out for 'em.
You stay off their trails.

23:13.443 --> 23:14.836
And you start to think

23:14.861 --> 23:16.483
- they're all right.
- Yeah.

23:16.523 --> 23:18.803
That they're safe.

23:18.843 --> 23:20.843
That they're not beasts.

23:21.963 --> 23:23.963
But they are.

23:43.003 --> 23:44.923
A toast.

23:44.963 --> 23:46.683
Good health.

23:54.763 --> 23:57.123
What brings you to Bregan, Slean?

23:57.163 --> 23:59.363
My mother sends a warning.

24:02.003 --> 24:05.083
The Warig are gathering under
a seer who advocates war.

24:05.123 --> 24:07.280
They're already pressing the Mere and

24:07.305 --> 24:09.323
they've attacked in the Edgelands.

24:09.363 --> 24:11.683
If they keep coming, Herot...

24:11.723 --> 24:13.723
or Bregan could be next.

24:15.403 --> 24:17.403
And we both know that...

24:19.163 --> 24:21.163
Herot is not ready for war.

24:21.203 --> 24:24.523
Which is why my mother sends
me to her most trusted brother.

24:25.443 --> 24:28.523
If the Alliance stands
together, it stands strong.

24:30.763 --> 24:33.083
Which of us will tell her she's mistaken?

24:36.763 --> 24:38.363
Saray.

24:39.483 --> 24:43.483
I think Slean would like
to... speak with me alone.

24:43.523 --> 24:45.523
Of course.

25:11.563 --> 25:13.363
Well?

25:13.403 --> 25:15.403
They're talking. Alone.

25:17.403 --> 25:20.723
If you ask me, we should kill
Slean, while we have the chance.

25:20.763 --> 25:22.763
Make it look like an accident.

25:24.123 --> 25:26.123
And why would anyone ask you?

25:28.963 --> 25:30.963
Two simple tasks.

25:31.003 --> 25:34.283
Keep Scorann from the Gathering
and get Slean on our side.

25:34.323 --> 25:36.723
You? You failed at both.

25:37.803 --> 25:40.803
With it, you've forfeited
your right to an opinion.

25:40.843 --> 25:43.843
Sometimes, I think you
forget you're just a healer.

25:44.923 --> 25:46.923
You preserve life.

25:47.923 --> 25:52.563
I take it and, when I do, I don't hesitate.

26:02.723 --> 26:04.723
So then the big one comes at me.

26:04.763 --> 26:06.123
Fast!

26:06.163 --> 26:08.195
Like a bear! And the other one gets

26:08.220 --> 26:10.283
me by the legs and down I go. Crash!

26:10.323 --> 26:14.643
And, straight away, the big
one is on me, pinning me down.

26:14.683 --> 26:18.283
I swear, I could feel the
life being crushed out of me.

26:21.643 --> 26:23.643
So what did you do?

26:23.683 --> 26:25.923
I thought it was all over.

26:25.963 --> 26:28.403
And then the big one's husband comes in.

26:28.443 --> 26:31.123
- Oh ho ho!
- He starts kicking me

26:31.163 --> 26:33.283
and she starts shrieking and lets go.

26:33.323 --> 26:35.637
So I seized my chance
and I ran and I didn't

26:35.662 --> 26:37.667
stop until I made it into the forest.

26:38.443 --> 26:40.843
And I never got my clothes back.

26:47.803 --> 26:50.923
What about you? Any narrow
escapes in your past?

26:50.963 --> 26:54.163
My whole past has been a narrow escape!

26:58.683 --> 27:00.923
Please! Aaah! Vorhelm!

27:02.043 --> 27:04.243
It's real! It's real!

27:05.443 --> 27:06.763
Urgh!

27:06.803 --> 27:08.763
Beowulf?

27:08.803 --> 27:10.923
Greff? Help!

27:12.683 --> 27:14.443
Greff!

27:31.443 --> 27:32.963
Climb!

28:21.612 --> 28:23.612
Scorann is dead because of you.

28:25.092 --> 28:28.452
If you were not my uncle,
I would take your life.

28:28.492 --> 28:30.492
Or die trying.

28:32.092 --> 28:34.572
I know your men stand ready to kill me.

28:34.612 --> 28:36.612
Is that what you think?

28:38.932 --> 28:41.412
Slean, I do not want you dead.

28:41.452 --> 28:43.452
I want you to be Thane.

28:44.532 --> 28:46.252
Why?

28:46.292 --> 28:48.292
You already run Herot.

28:48.332 --> 28:50.812
The miners know you. The smelters know you.

28:50.852 --> 28:54.452
The Huskarla answer to you. You
are Thane already in all but name.

28:55.532 --> 28:58.132
I think your plan is to
use me to kill my mother.

28:59.692 --> 29:03.172
And, once you've done that,
you'll have no use for me any more.

29:06.692 --> 29:08.692
I love my sister.

29:09.772 --> 29:11.772
And I would never harm her.

29:13.852 --> 29:17.452
But she is not the leader our tribes need.

29:18.652 --> 29:20.252
You know it.

29:20.292 --> 29:23.332
Herot needs a real Thane.

29:23.372 --> 29:28.092
And the Shieldlands need a
true Jarl to lead its tribes.

29:30.412 --> 29:32.412
Both need to be warriors.

29:33.492 --> 29:35.292
Men...

29:35.332 --> 29:37.612
who know how to protect their people.

29:38.692 --> 29:40.692
You could be one.

29:41.772 --> 29:43.772
And I the other.

29:47.052 --> 29:49.052
If we do this...

29:51.772 --> 29:53.772
my mother must come to no harm.

29:53.812 --> 29:55.812
I promise you.

29:57.692 --> 30:01.692
But you know, in your heart,
she cannot lead us to victory.

30:23.332 --> 30:25.745
You would think that
a simple marriage would

30:25.770 --> 30:28.236
be the easiest thing
in the world to manage.

30:29.292 --> 30:31.572
Instead, we have a replacement bride...

30:32.892 --> 30:36.372
and a bridegroom brawling in
the street with his own reeve.

30:39.372 --> 30:43.052
Who knows how long it'll be before
he cools down and comes back?

30:43.092 --> 30:46.692
Is it strictly necessary for the
groom to be present at a wedding?

30:47.812 --> 30:50.892
I can imagine things would
be a lot simpler without him!

30:54.412 --> 30:58.132
When you were with the Varni,
you trained with weapons?

31:00.132 --> 31:02.132
Every day.

31:03.132 --> 31:05.252
- Every warrior?
- Every warrior.

31:05.292 --> 31:07.292
Every woman.

31:08.292 --> 31:10.492
Every child big enough to hold a sword.

31:11.492 --> 31:14.092
The warriors may be the teeth of the wolf.

31:15.252 --> 31:18.052
Sometimes, a beast
needs its claws, as well.

31:19.132 --> 31:21.132
That's what Beowulf thinks.

31:21.172 --> 31:23.172
If war is coming...

31:24.252 --> 31:26.252
we need to prepare.

31:26.292 --> 31:29.492
When he returns, give him what he needs.

31:40.332 --> 31:42.332
Breca!

31:44.692 --> 31:46.692
Where's the troll?

31:51.492 --> 31:53.492
I dealt with it.

31:53.532 --> 31:55.532
So it didn't just attack once.

31:55.572 --> 31:57.172
It came back.

31:57.212 --> 31:59.212
That's not usual.

31:59.252 --> 32:01.252
Something drove it to this.

32:05.692 --> 32:08.292
Over here! The salt I left out for 'em.

32:08.332 --> 32:10.332
A fresh batch.

32:19.692 --> 32:21.692
It's light.

32:30.452 --> 32:32.452
What is that?

32:32.492 --> 32:34.292
Sand.

32:34.332 --> 32:37.332
An inch of salt to cover it
up and the rest is just sand.

32:39.412 --> 32:41.412
These old ones are good, but...

32:41.452 --> 32:43.452
they're nearly used up.

32:43.492 --> 32:45.580
So when they get to the new ones, all

32:45.605 --> 32:48.076
they're going to get is a mouthful of grit.

32:49.452 --> 32:51.452
They're gonna go mad.

32:52.532 --> 32:54.532
They'll kill everyone!

32:58.692 --> 33:00.692
We need more salt.

33:38.692 --> 33:40.692
You two have talked the day away.

33:41.772 --> 33:43.972
Yeah, well, there was a lot to say.

33:44.012 --> 33:47.012
- He's a good man.
- What? Did he tell you to say that?

33:47.052 --> 33:48.852
It's the truth.

33:50.052 --> 33:51.852
Tell me this.

33:51.892 --> 33:54.772
If Abrecan had been a poor
fisherman and not a Thane,

33:54.812 --> 33:58.092
his hands all covered in fish
scales and cut by the lines...

33:59.212 --> 34:01.212
would you still love him?

34:01.252 --> 34:04.052
You may not believe it,
but I've known good and bad.

34:05.052 --> 34:07.052
I've looked them in the face.

34:07.092 --> 34:11.092
And I've done bad things, with
bad men, for the worst of reasons.

34:11.132 --> 34:13.132
Abrecan is a good man.

34:21.252 --> 34:22.532
Yaaah!

34:32.612 --> 34:34.812
Attack the village! Kill them all!

34:36.812 --> 34:38.812
Raiders!

34:38.851 --> 34:40.851
Come on!

34:44.812 --> 34:46.331
Go!

34:55.812 --> 34:57.692
Yaaah! Yaaah!

34:58.692 --> 35:00.292
Yaaah!

35:19.172 --> 35:21.132
Yaaah-aaah-aaah!

35:24.172 --> 35:26.452
- Wulfing raiders!
- Get inside.

35:26.492 --> 35:30.492
Hold them back! Defend the
walls! Get those gates closed!

35:30.532 --> 35:34.132
Are you at my side? Or would
you rather ride home to Herot?

35:36.852 --> 35:38.572
Away!

35:47.532 --> 35:49.292
Go! Go!

36:15.092 --> 36:17.492
Leave the girl. Take the gate!

36:24.052 --> 36:26.052
Go on! Go on!

36:27.132 --> 36:28.732
Whaaah!

36:51.172 --> 36:53.172
Burn it all!

37:08.412 --> 37:10.412
Stop them!

37:20.012 --> 37:21.412
Urgh.

37:56.732 --> 37:59.052
To the boat! To the boats!

37:59.092 --> 38:00.852
Yaaa-aaah! Yaaah!

38:04.572 --> 38:06.572
Uhh! Uhh...

38:13.252 --> 38:15.252
- Aah!
- Do you feel that?

38:15.292 --> 38:17.292
That's defeat.

38:19.532 --> 38:21.132
Come on!

38:21.172 --> 38:23.172
Come on!

38:27.772 --> 38:29.732
After them!

38:29.772 --> 38:32.212
No. No, no, no. They've gone. They've gone.

38:36.092 --> 38:38.092
But they have paid.

38:38.132 --> 38:40.132
Not as hard as we have.

38:42.452 --> 38:45.852
But they won't return.
They know we'll be waiting.

38:45.892 --> 38:49.372
We should light the tower,
warn the other tribes.

38:49.412 --> 38:51.252
No.

38:51.292 --> 38:53.292
No. Leave the signal fire unlit.

38:53.332 --> 38:55.460
Let's see how Beowulf fares if the

38:55.485 --> 38:57.892
raiders attack when Herot's not ready.

38:57.932 --> 39:01.732
It will weaken my mother in the eyes
of her people and of the Alliance.

39:02.972 --> 39:04.972
I knew I was right about you.

39:05.972 --> 39:07.972
What is it?

39:08.972 --> 39:11.772
Help me! Help me!

39:12.932 --> 39:14.412
Aaah.

39:14.452 --> 39:16.852
- Get him inside now.
- Put your arm round me.

39:16.892 --> 39:20.292
Open the gates! The gates!

39:20.332 --> 39:21.932
Quickly!

39:32.772 --> 39:34.772
They're all worthless.

39:34.812 --> 39:36.812
Someone did this to harm us.

39:36.852 --> 39:39.292
- You think it's the Warig prophet?
- No.

39:39.332 --> 39:41.332
This is not a mudborn threat.

39:42.332 --> 39:44.332
Whoever's behind this is a man...

39:44.372 --> 39:46.372
and a traitor.

39:47.892 --> 39:49.892
A traitor in Herot?

39:50.972 --> 39:52.972
I don't think so.

40:01.012 --> 40:03.732
Scrape together all the
salt we have in Herot.

40:03.772 --> 40:07.412
It should be enough to pacify
the trolls until we can get more.

40:07.452 --> 40:09.452
The salt came from Bregan.

40:09.492 --> 40:11.492
Someone there did this to us.

40:12.572 --> 40:14.692
Or someone wanted it to look that way.

40:16.452 --> 40:19.262
The Varni wanted the miners
to sell them their ore.

40:19.287 --> 40:21.532
This could be their idea of retribution.

40:21.572 --> 40:23.332
Maybe.

40:24.492 --> 40:26.612
I'll go to Bregan, see what I can find.

40:27.652 --> 40:30.252
My brother will help you
root out this traitor.

40:34.732 --> 40:36.212
Aaah.

40:37.332 --> 40:41.492
It's a clean wound, not too
deep. We can bind and poultice it.

40:41.532 --> 40:45.852
My arse, it's clean. Those Wulfing
blades are thick with filth!

40:45.892 --> 40:47.892
- Aaah! Urgh!
- Steady.

40:49.732 --> 40:53.092
Send Vlade to see if
they are headed for Herot.

40:53.132 --> 40:54.932
- Aaah!
- Stay still.

40:54.972 --> 40:59.732
We lost Rennick and we lost
Tove for such little gold.

40:59.772 --> 41:01.772
Then we strike again!

41:02.852 --> 41:04.852
We've already wounded their Thane.

41:06.412 --> 41:08.412
He could be dead by now, Jogan.

41:08.452 --> 41:10.175
They are a hundred to our dozen!

41:10.200 --> 41:11.276
- They are weak!
- No!

41:16.652 --> 41:18.652
We lost this battle.

41:20.772 --> 41:22.772
Then we go home, then?

41:24.852 --> 41:27.532
With our tails between our legs,

41:27.572 --> 41:32.572
with nothing to show our clan
or your brother, our war father?

41:34.372 --> 41:36.372
Or perhaps...

41:37.732 --> 41:40.532
we leave these fishermen
to their fish guts...

41:42.212 --> 41:45.492
and go for a different
target, a bigger target.

41:46.652 --> 41:48.972
Bregan have not lit their warning fires.

41:50.332 --> 41:52.852
And Herot does not know we are coming.

41:52.892 --> 41:55.132
And it is there we have to surprise

41:55.172 --> 41:57.172
and it is there

41:57.212 --> 41:59.212
we find gold and iron.

42:00.012 --> 42:02.292
We strike them deep in their heart.

42:02.332 --> 42:06.132
And, this time, we don't leave
the dog to guard the boat.

42:11.612 --> 42:14.212
Get the dog! It comes with us.

42:20.132 --> 42:22.452
Do whatever you have to to protect Herot.

42:26.732 --> 42:28.732
Our enemies are coming.

42:44.372 --> 42:46.372
Ready?

42:46.412 --> 42:48.812
We will go to Herot
and tear out its throat.

42:59.372 --> 43:01.641
I followed the Wulfings
as far as the Draca Bridge.

43:01.666 --> 43:03.212
Good. So they are bound for Herot.

43:06.932 --> 43:09.012
Wulfing raiders killed my husband.

43:09.052 --> 43:10.512
If we don't strike back, they'll

43:10.537 --> 43:11.972
- think we're weak.
- We are weak!

43:12.012 --> 43:15.052
- Where's Kela?
- She's pretty. She'll fetch a price.

43:15.092 --> 43:18.892
I don't care how you do
it, but you get her back.

43:25.052 --> 43:26.652
Vishka, throw me the axe.

43:28.332 --> 43:29.760
Throw it!

43:30.305 --> 43:36.598
