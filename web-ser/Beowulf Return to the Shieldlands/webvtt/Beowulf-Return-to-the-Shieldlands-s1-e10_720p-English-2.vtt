00:02.040 --> 00:05.040
- There's no turning you, is there?
- No.

00:05.080 --> 00:06.760
Then I'll take you as you are.

00:06.800 --> 00:08.680
You, my friend, don't know who I am.

00:08.720 --> 00:11.840
Never come back to
Herot. You're dead to me.

00:11.880 --> 00:13.760
Play the part your
mother has set for you.

00:13.800 --> 00:16.239
She'll not be expecting when
we take power from her.

00:16.280 --> 00:18.040
Do you want to be Thane?

00:19.880 --> 00:22.800
Tell my uncle I am done with him.

00:22.840 --> 00:25.040
You have hid in the
shadows for too long.

00:25.080 --> 00:26.880
If you want power, take it.

00:26.920 --> 00:29.840
If I tell my mother the
truth, I'll lose her trust.

00:29.880 --> 00:32.439
And with it, any chance of ever ruling.

00:32.479 --> 00:34.720
But if Abrecan
attacks, Herot could fall.

00:34.760 --> 00:39.240
I have a vision for
us... to be the greatest tribe.

00:41.320 --> 00:44.400
Abrecan is going to attack Herot.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074

01:34.240 --> 01:37.000
I won't let anyone hurt you.

01:37.040 --> 01:39.040
Ever again.

Synced and corrected by VitoSilans

02:38.720 --> 02:40.601
Abrecan would never betray me.

02:40.640 --> 02:43.080
I speak only the truth.

02:43.120 --> 02:46.360
I heard him call for his
people to attack Herot.

02:46.400 --> 02:49.280
He's building an army.

02:49.320 --> 02:51.680
This man is a thief and a murderer.

02:51.720 --> 02:54.160
I believe him.

02:54.200 --> 02:58.560
Our enemy are the Warig. This
prophet Razzak, not my brother.

02:58.600 --> 03:01.440
Ready my horse.

03:01.480 --> 03:05.080
You come to me and tell
me that Abrecan is a traitor?

03:05.120 --> 03:08.040
Well, I will ask him to his face.

03:08.080 --> 03:11.040
Rheda, you can't!

03:13.120 --> 03:15.120
Wait!

03:19.520 --> 03:22.400
Beowulf has told your
mother of Abrecan's betrayal.

03:22.440 --> 03:24.480
How does he know?

03:24.520 --> 03:27.400
Does it matter? She's
about to ride to Bregan.

03:27.440 --> 03:30.000
I have to go.

03:30.040 --> 03:32.680
I have to tell her.

03:32.720 --> 03:35.920
That it was you that made her believe
the Varni was Herot's enemy,

03:35.960 --> 03:38.040
plotted with Abrecan to overthrow her?

03:38.080 --> 03:40.240
No, she can't go.

03:40.280 --> 03:43.360
If she doesn't come back...

03:43.400 --> 03:45.400
you will be Thane.

03:47.920 --> 03:50.120
Rheda, you can't go to Bregan.

03:50.160 --> 03:52.560
If it's true and Abrecan is a traitor,

03:52.600 --> 03:55.280
then you're riding straight
into the arms of your enemy.

03:55.320 --> 03:57.320
You're speaking of my brother.

03:57.360 --> 03:59.120
- Let me take your place.
- No.

03:59.160 --> 04:01.320
At least take an
escort of Slean's Huskarla.

04:01.360 --> 04:03.600
The men are needed here
should the Warig attack.

04:03.640 --> 04:06.200
- Now step aside, both of you.
- Mother.

04:06.240 --> 04:10.960
Prepare the people to fight our
real enemy, the Mudborn. Go!

04:15.120 --> 04:17.120
Abrecan won't harm her.

04:17.160 --> 04:23.240
Whatever he's done or he's
planning, he would never harm his sister.

04:23.280 --> 04:25.280
Let's hope you're right.

04:29.760 --> 04:31.760
I see a land.

04:31.800 --> 04:38.480
A land where the Mudborn roam freely

04:38.520 --> 04:46.280
amongst the broken stones and empty
halls that were once our homes.

04:46.320 --> 04:49.480
Where we are no more than a memory.

04:49.520 --> 04:54.600
Like the giants that
ruled here before us.

04:54.640 --> 04:57.480
This is our future.

04:57.520 --> 05:00.960
Unless we are strong.

05:03.160 --> 05:07.160
Some doubted that I cared
for the people of Bregan.

05:09.280 --> 05:14.480
My people doubted
me... their rightful Thane.

05:16.920 --> 05:20.520
I was once taught that a
good man forgives those

05:20.560 --> 05:23.960
with the courage to
admit they are at fault.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.760
With the courage to
ask for that forgiveness.

05:36.560 --> 05:40.720
I also taught you that a good
man should have the courage

05:40.760 --> 05:42.840
to stand by what he believes.

05:42.880 --> 05:46.600
Your plans to attack your
own sister offend me.

05:55.440 --> 06:00.760
Thank you for teaching
me this last lesson.

06:00.800 --> 06:07.320
That a good man and a good
leader are not the same.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Argh!

06:26.200 --> 06:32.160
If the Shieldlands are to
remain, we must be strong!

06:32.200 --> 06:36.640
And I must be Jarl!

06:49.360 --> 06:53.480
Greetings, Skellen, Warfather
of the Wulfing.

06:56.880 --> 07:01.280
I have a proposition for you
from Abrecan, Bregan's Thane.

07:01.320 --> 07:04.640
Further to the one the
Wulfing boy delivered.

07:04.680 --> 07:09.240
It's one you'll want to
hear rather than kill me.

07:16.440 --> 07:18.440
Good work.

07:36.960 --> 07:39.760
Your sister will
hear what you're planning.

07:42.320 --> 07:45.720
I know. And she will come.

07:45.760 --> 07:49.560
When she does, will you string
her up alongside Harken?

07:52.920 --> 07:57.760
You were the one who said, "Be bold."

08:10.480 --> 08:13.080
You spent time in Bregan.

08:13.120 --> 08:18.480
How many warriors can they
field if Abrecan wages war?

08:18.520 --> 08:22.040
No more than 50. But
they're no match for ours.

08:22.080 --> 08:25.320
And the Huskarla
are training the people.

08:25.360 --> 08:28.040
Every person who can lift a sword.

08:28.080 --> 08:32.840
Apart from the smelters. They
don't appreciate being told what to do.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.880
Maybe not by the Huskarla.

08:35.919 --> 08:38.880
Leave them to to me.

08:38.919 --> 08:42.400
If there is war, all our
people must be ready to fight.

08:52.240 --> 08:57.560
Right! You are all here to learn
to fight like Huskarla.

08:57.600 --> 09:01.640
You townspeople are going to
fight with us to protect Herot.

09:01.680 --> 09:05.440
Lila, you're with me.

09:05.480 --> 09:12.040
Everybody, grab
yourselves a weapon. Let's go!

09:16.520 --> 09:18.520
What kind of favour is this?

09:18.560 --> 09:20.520
Well, if you're right about Abrecan,

09:20.560 --> 09:22.840
we're going to need all
the help we can get.

09:22.880 --> 09:28.600
So the favour... teach
them to fight. Fight dirty.

09:28.640 --> 09:30.640
Smelters!

09:30.680 --> 09:34.640
Like you, they ignore authority.

09:34.680 --> 09:36.840
That's why you're gonna teach them.

09:36.880 --> 09:39.080
This is Breca.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.280
Some of you know him.

09:41.320 --> 09:45.480
Some of you are owed money by him.

09:45.520 --> 09:48.520
He's here to share a
few things with you.

09:53.520 --> 09:55.800
Wait. Beowulf...

10:10.600 --> 10:17.000
Come on! Sweat,
blister, bleed if you have to!

10:17.040 --> 10:19.600
It's not Herot or a
Thane you'll be fighting for

10:19.640 --> 10:22.440
when those Mudborn break
through those walls.

10:22.480 --> 10:25.040
When they're in here among us,

10:25.080 --> 10:29.600
you'll be all that stands
between those you love and the Warig.

10:29.640 --> 10:32.960
Stand strong together and we shall win!

10:35.400 --> 10:38.720
Right, you heard him! Back to it.

10:45.480 --> 10:47.400
Rargh!

10:47.440 --> 10:50.440
Wood splinters.

10:50.480 --> 10:54.880
It's no good to
you, not in a real fight.

10:56.440 --> 10:59.280
Iron.

11:01.680 --> 11:04.480
This is the perfect weapon.

11:04.520 --> 11:09.400
And it won't just kill a
man, it'll bury him too.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.440
Better.

11:18.240 --> 11:20.200
Better.

11:30.040 --> 11:33.680
- Bah!
- Don't tell me you're not tempted.

11:33.720 --> 11:38.000
You strike first, you
live. You don't, you die.

11:38.040 --> 11:41.160
See, I told
you. Let them come at you.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.480
If you're running at
them, you're not thinking.

11:43.520 --> 11:47.120
If you're not
thinking, bad things happen.

11:50.760 --> 11:52.760
Yah!

11:56.480 --> 11:59.120
Harder!

12:04.760 --> 12:07.400
Gil, the troll is hungry!

12:07.440 --> 12:09.200
I told you, you have to clear out.

12:09.240 --> 12:12.280
We have to bring the troll back,
it should have been fed hours ago.

12:12.320 --> 12:14.360
When we're done. They
could do with a break.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.560
Clear out, now!

12:51.320 --> 12:54.040
- Have you ever seen an angry troll?
- I'm looking at one.

12:54.080 --> 12:55.760
- Gil!
- It needs its salt!

12:55.800 --> 12:57.800
Back down.

13:03.640 --> 13:05.640
Breca!

13:23.680 --> 13:25.680
Argh!

13:36.040 --> 13:38.040
He's dead.

13:41.640 --> 13:43.360
You see?

13:43.400 --> 13:46.440
It was only a matter of time
before the Mudborn killed somebody.

13:46.480 --> 13:49.240
It's killed a human. It's
angry, it could kill again.

13:49.280 --> 13:51.120
We have to hunt it down.

13:51.160 --> 13:53.320
Gil, go with him.

13:53.360 --> 13:55.600
You, get back in there.

13:55.640 --> 13:58.400
Everybody back to your training.

13:58.440 --> 14:00.760
I'll come.

14:00.800 --> 14:03.160
All right.

14:06.480 --> 14:08.480
Don't let him kill it.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.920
Bring it back alive.

15:18.240 --> 15:20.240
What are you doing?

15:20.280 --> 15:24.120
Elvina's gone, I thought I would erm...

15:24.160 --> 15:27.200
I'm being insensitive.

15:27.240 --> 15:32.040
Of course...

15:32.080 --> 15:34.720
you cared for her deeply.

15:34.760 --> 15:38.280
I loved her.

15:38.320 --> 15:41.520
It must have been hard for you,

15:41.560 --> 15:44.800
to see her so happy...

15:44.840 --> 15:47.080
with Beowulf.

15:49.400 --> 15:53.520
But we must be
practical. Herot needs a Healer.

15:53.560 --> 15:58.000
Never more than at this time, when
we have enemies on all sides.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.680
You think you can replace her?

16:00.720 --> 16:02.840
Replace her?

16:02.880 --> 16:05.080
No, I just want to help.

16:05.120 --> 16:08.680
I'm not seeking your
permission to do this,

16:08.720 --> 16:12.080
but I'd rather it
was with your blessing.

16:14.800 --> 16:18.760
All right. Just don't poison anyone.

17:02.360 --> 17:04.359
Elvina.

18:10.800 --> 18:13.640
Beowulf said...

18:13.680 --> 18:15.680
Said what?

18:17.760 --> 18:20.640
That you were dead.

18:23.040 --> 18:25.640
I'm sorry, I...

18:25.680 --> 18:28.280
Does Slean know you're alive?

18:30.400 --> 18:34.760
Kela, whatever was between Slean
and me, it's in the past.

18:34.800 --> 18:38.360
You've nothing to fear from me.

18:38.400 --> 18:41.240
Perhaps you could help me?

18:41.280 --> 18:46.520
- What are you making?
- It's for the treating of wounds.

18:46.560 --> 18:50.480
- Is that wormwood?
- The healer in Mere used it.

18:50.520 --> 18:53.560
Yes. And celladine?

18:53.600 --> 18:55.600
Yes.

18:55.640 --> 18:58.920
I'd like it if we could be friends.

18:58.960 --> 19:00.960
Aren't we?

19:03.560 --> 19:05.560
Of course.

19:34.360 --> 19:38.560
What you're using won't seal the wound,
but this will numb the pain.

19:43.640 --> 19:46.320
Beowulf said the Warig killed you.

19:49.680 --> 19:51.920
I escaped through the forest.

19:59.200 --> 20:01.200
Kela.

20:01.240 --> 20:03.240
You're telling me to leave?

20:03.280 --> 20:05.280
Please.

20:22.520 --> 20:24.560
Beowulf knows the truth.

20:24.600 --> 20:26.600
What truth?

20:26.640 --> 20:28.640
He knows what I am.

20:28.680 --> 20:30.680
You told him?

20:30.720 --> 20:35.280
He saw. I had no choice, it
was that or let him die.

20:37.200 --> 20:41.880
A skinshifter saved his
life. He must have choked on that.

20:45.360 --> 20:47.360
I won't let him harm you.

20:49.800 --> 20:51.800
I won't.

21:40.240 --> 21:45.840
Sister, this is an unexpected pleasure.

21:50.760 --> 21:55.240
It has been too long since
you have been home.

21:59.560 --> 22:01.840
I'm not here for pleasure.

22:01.880 --> 22:05.440
I've been hearing things.

22:05.480 --> 22:07.600
About Bregan.

22:07.640 --> 22:09.800
About you.

22:09.840 --> 22:12.400
Rumours.

22:20.520 --> 22:24.960
Why does the body of one of
Bregan's most loyal and wise councillors

22:25.000 --> 22:27.840
hang at the city walls?

22:30.520 --> 22:32.640
- Rheda.
- Saray.

22:36.040 --> 22:40.120
You must be tired after your journey.
Let me take you to wash.

22:40.160 --> 22:44.120
Thank you, Saray, but I
need to speak with my brother.

22:47.560 --> 22:49.560
Leave us.

22:49.600 --> 22:51.160
Of course.

22:58.320 --> 23:00.320
Run.

23:14.080 --> 23:16.240
Maybe Kendra has a point.

23:16.280 --> 23:20.440
The troll does the work of 20
men... men who could be preparing to fight.

23:20.480 --> 23:23.160
We could take it back alive.

23:23.200 --> 23:25.880
It killed a man.

23:25.920 --> 23:28.640
The Mudborn have no place among us.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.760
I only asked.

23:32.800 --> 23:35.600
Like you said, it killed
because it was hungry, frightened.

23:35.640 --> 23:37.560
We know the reason it
acted the way it did.

23:37.600 --> 23:41.800
No! They don't reason. They just hate.

23:41.840 --> 23:44.400
That's why the Warig
killed the Huskarla in the forest,

23:44.440 --> 23:46.160
that's why the troll killed today.

23:46.200 --> 23:49.360
Even if that were true,
where does hating them back get us?

23:49.400 --> 23:51.840
With a little sense, to the point where

23:51.880 --> 23:54.880
we find every one of
them and cut their throats.

23:54.920 --> 23:58.320
Right, Beowulf, you understand.

23:58.360 --> 24:01.480
Mudborn scum have
killed people I care about.

24:09.520 --> 24:13.400
There are two sets of tracks
here. Gil, take Vishka.

24:47.520 --> 24:51.080
Boy! Bring us some more firewood.

24:55.520 --> 24:58.160
Firewood is hard to come
by here at the coast.

24:58.200 --> 25:03.040
So your gift of the
pillar was most welcome.

25:04.480 --> 25:06.560
Those laws were meant to unite us.

25:06.600 --> 25:09.720
So they will... in warmth.

25:09.760 --> 25:12.880
You forget yourself.

25:12.920 --> 25:17.360
Not only am I your
sister, I am also your Jarl.

25:17.400 --> 25:19.400
Oh, yes, so you are.

25:21.480 --> 25:23.440
For today.

25:23.480 --> 25:26.400
And who will be Jarl tomorrow, you?

26:12.840 --> 26:17.400
If you're going to end
my life, do it now.

26:17.440 --> 26:20.040
I never wanted to harm you.

26:20.080 --> 26:24.680
Things would have gone a
lot easier for me if I had.

26:29.160 --> 26:33.920
A ship leaves for the
Farlands on the next tide.

26:33.960 --> 26:38.640
Give me what I want
and you will sail with it.

26:40.760 --> 26:42.760
Refuse...

27:34.240 --> 27:37.320
Beowulf, no!

27:41.280 --> 27:45.200
Look, it's calmer. Let's take it back.

27:45.240 --> 27:48.000
It doesn't belong
here. Please don't kill it.

28:18.440 --> 28:20.560
Beowulf, he's gonna kill it!

28:24.680 --> 28:28.000
Hey! Yaaaaargh!

28:56.160 --> 28:59.280
- What's that?
- A decree.

28:59.320 --> 29:01.120
Stating you relinquish your claim

29:01.160 --> 29:03.880
to be both Jarl of the
Shieldlands and Thane of Herot.

29:03.920 --> 29:06.680
Huh.

29:06.720 --> 29:08.840
Even if I sign,

29:08.880 --> 29:12.120
you need the other Thanes to
vote for you at a Gathering.

29:12.160 --> 29:17.400
You threw Rate out. And
the others I can deal with.

29:19.680 --> 29:22.200
And what is your
answer? Will you sign it?

29:22.240 --> 29:25.600
I would never do that to my son.

29:25.640 --> 29:28.560
Of course, your son.

29:28.600 --> 29:32.160
Even without knowing
it, you prove I'm right

29:32.200 --> 29:35.240
that you are the wrong
choice to lead us.

29:35.280 --> 29:37.080
Because I care for my family?

29:37.120 --> 29:39.680
Because you let your
heart rule your head.

29:42.360 --> 29:44.840
Your son, your wonderful, loyal son,

29:44.880 --> 29:48.560
he was the one who laid the
false blame on the Varni,

29:48.600 --> 29:51.600
even though he knew it was
I who moved against you.

29:51.640 --> 29:53.880
You're lying. Slean would never do that.

29:53.920 --> 29:57.360
Just as he'd never have told my
men not to light the warning pyre

29:57.400 --> 29:59.400
to alert Herot of the Wulfing raid?

30:04.840 --> 30:07.200
You have no idea, do you?

30:07.240 --> 30:11.240
You have absolutely no idea
what it's like to be related to you.

30:15.520 --> 30:20.120
Sign, or I will do what must be done.

31:00.002 --> 31:02.322
Thank you for bringing it back alive.

31:02.362 --> 31:04.362
Thank Vishka.

31:15.442 --> 31:17.962
- What are you doing here?
- I'm not gonna let you hurt her.

31:18.002 --> 31:21.362
- Stay out of this, Slean.
- You think I don't know?

31:24.362 --> 31:26.482
How long have you
known she was a skinshifter?

31:26.522 --> 31:32.402
Years. It's never
made a difference to me.

31:34.042 --> 31:36.762
We need to talk. The three of us.

31:49.122 --> 31:53.002
You knew she was a skinshifter? You
put everyone in Herot at risk.

31:53.042 --> 31:56.482
- She's no threat.
- I saw what she did to the Warig.

31:56.522 --> 31:58.682
Which she did to save your life.

31:58.722 --> 32:01.282
I'm a healer. I help
people, I don't harm them.

32:01.322 --> 32:03.002
You think they'll care?

32:03.042 --> 32:05.682
You saw what they did to
the skinshifter they found here.

32:05.722 --> 32:08.322
They'll just drag you out
into the street and finish you.

32:08.362 --> 32:10.282
- I won't let them.
- You won't have a choice.

32:10.322 --> 32:14.442
Thane's son or not. It was an
open secret that she was your woman.

32:14.482 --> 32:17.322
She's a skinshifter, she
can take care of herself.

32:17.362 --> 32:20.042
But you... they'll have your life.

32:20.082 --> 32:23.202
That's the law, that's what they
do to those who lie with the Mudborn.

32:23.242 --> 32:26.282
Who's gonna tell them? You?

32:26.322 --> 32:30.922
You do that and I will make
sure you are cut down with us.

32:34.442 --> 32:36.442
Why did you come back?

32:36.482 --> 32:39.482
Because this is my home.

32:39.522 --> 32:42.962
You, as much as
anyone, know what that means.

32:47.442 --> 32:49.442
Stay if you wish.

32:49.482 --> 32:51.482
But this is on you.

33:04.802 --> 33:09.082
Rheda would die before
she yields, you know that.

33:09.122 --> 33:12.042
She has your strength.

33:14.122 --> 33:17.282
You said you would stand by me.

33:17.322 --> 33:20.562
This is not standing by me!

33:22.722 --> 33:24.762
I have given her her chance.

33:24.802 --> 33:27.042
A sister's blood will not wash away.

33:27.082 --> 33:31.802
Then I will wear it with honour.

33:31.842 --> 33:35.122
As I will have spilt it for my people.

33:39.362 --> 33:42.282
We must prepare for what is coming.

33:42.322 --> 33:44.322
You're burning up. Your wound...

34:03.362 --> 34:05.722
You saved me from my darkness.

34:05.762 --> 34:09.522
I will not stand by and let
that same darkness take you.

34:09.562 --> 34:11.562
Let your sister go.

34:17.002 --> 34:21.161
If you love me,

34:21.202 --> 34:25.482
if you ever loved me, let her go.

34:30.842 --> 34:36.121
You are nothing. A body
to warm my bed with.

34:36.161 --> 34:38.161
Abrecan?

34:40.882 --> 34:44.002
What's he doing here? I
thought you sent him away.

34:44.042 --> 34:46.042
Well?

34:46.081 --> 34:48.922
Their flags unfurl and
their sails catch the wind.

34:48.962 --> 34:51.042
They will be here before nightfall.

34:51.081 --> 34:53.962
They agreed to your terms.

34:56.842 --> 34:58.842
You have done well.

35:03.482 --> 35:05.482
Who will be here by nightfall?

35:08.842 --> 35:11.282
What have you done?

35:11.322 --> 35:13.322
Leave.

35:15.642 --> 35:17.642
Now.

35:19.682 --> 35:23.602
If I require your
services, I will send for you.

35:23.642 --> 35:27.002
As you will.

35:41.962 --> 35:44.562
Bring me my sister!

36:06.802 --> 36:08.802
Leave us.

36:16.162 --> 36:18.362
I've considered
everything you've had to say.

36:34.882 --> 36:36.882
That is your answer, then.

36:40.602 --> 36:42.602
It is.

36:47.562 --> 36:49.562
I won't enjoy this.

36:49.602 --> 36:54.282
What happened to you? What had to.

36:55.762 --> 36:57.762
Argh!

37:08.962 --> 37:11.202
I am glad you put up a fight.

37:18.162 --> 37:21.602
He's alive. We don't have long.

37:44.802 --> 37:46.802
Follow me.

37:54.082 --> 37:56.082
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

38:00.442 --> 38:02.322
- You go.
- What about you?

38:02.362 --> 38:05.922
- I'll follow.
- If they catch you...

38:05.962 --> 38:09.162
Saray, he is beyond saving.

38:09.202 --> 38:12.322
But you're not and Herot needs you.

38:14.842 --> 38:16.962
- Over there! Stop her!
- Go!

38:57.362 --> 38:59.362
Yaaah!

39:26.802 --> 39:28.762
She got away.

39:28.802 --> 39:30.802
It doesn't matter.

39:33.202 --> 39:37.802
Soon, 200 Wulfing
warriors will be ashore.

39:37.842 --> 39:40.122
You've allied yourself to the Wulfing?

39:40.162 --> 39:43.242
They'll plunder Herot and then
sail back across the Whale Road.

39:43.282 --> 39:46.122
They won't just plunder, they'll kill.

39:46.162 --> 39:47.882
A few lives, some gold.

39:47.922 --> 39:50.802
A small price to pay compared
to what they'll get in return.

39:52.922 --> 39:58.482
A leader who can save the Shieldlands.

39:58.522 --> 40:02.162
I should have taken your
life the night we met.

40:17.802 --> 40:20.162
And to think I almost left with you.

40:25.202 --> 40:29.562
I came this close to missing
what fate has in store to me.

41:45.282 --> 41:48.762
See that her body is
burned with the other traitors.

41:48.802 --> 41:52.202
After that, there will be
time enough or me to rest...

41:52.242 --> 41:54.642
in Herot's Golden Hall.

41:54.682 --> 41:59.882
Once the Wulfing dogs
have landed on our shores.

42:18.122 --> 42:19.802
Stop.

42:19.842 --> 42:22.882
My brother has betrayed
us. All because of my son.

42:22.922 --> 42:25.402
He has allied Bregan with the Wulfings.

42:25.442 --> 42:27.362
And now an army marches on Herot.

42:27.402 --> 42:29.442
At the Draca Bridge,
with a dozen Huskarla,

42:29.482 --> 42:31.842
we might be able to hold
them off for at least a day.

42:31.882 --> 42:34.322
This could be Herot's only chance.

42:34.362 --> 42:38.122
You must send word to the Varni.
I banished them from the Alliance.

42:38.162 --> 42:41.762
Any messenger I send to Rate will
be sent back to us in pieces.

42:41.802 --> 42:43.762
For glory!

42:43.802 --> 42:45.922
Slean has gone
to stop the Wulfings.

42:45.962 --> 42:48.722
He and his Huskarla will buy
you the time for help to reach us.

42:48.762 --> 42:50.762
And he will not come back alive.

42:50.802 --> 42:53.682
But he will die with honour.

42:53.722 --> 42:54.751
Charge!
