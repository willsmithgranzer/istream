00:04.846 --> 00:11.086
I see a land. A land
where the Mudborn roam freely...

00:15.566 --> 00:18.366
amongst the broken stones...

00:20.726 --> 00:22.726
and empty halls...

00:22.766 --> 00:24.766
that were once our homes.

00:24.806 --> 00:26.006
(SCREAMS)

00:27.966 --> 00:30.465
Our enemies can detect Herot's weakness

00:30.490 --> 00:32.526
because it is ruled by a woman.

00:32.566 --> 00:35.886
If war is coming, we need to prepare.

00:35.926 --> 00:40.206
Some say there's no bond stronger than
blood but I don't believe that.

00:40.246 --> 00:44.686
Iron, threat, opportunity
brought us here.

00:44.726 --> 00:48.206
May the ancestors forgive me,
but that's stronger than blood.

00:49.046 --> 00:52.204
This land needs a warrior
at its heart to

00:52.229 --> 00:55.310
bring its people through this darkness.

00:58.086 --> 01:01.126
The Shieldlands need a
jarl who will protect us...

01:03.246 --> 01:06.726
a man of strength who will take control.

01:06.766 --> 01:09.286
- For glory!
- (YELLS)

01:09.326 --> 01:11.206
We must be strong.

01:11.886 --> 01:14.566
And I must be Jarl!

01:58.606 --> 02:01.006
Abrecan's army will be upon us soon.

02:06.446 --> 02:08.446
Let Slean command beside Beowulf.

02:08.485 --> 02:11.606
The Huskarla look to him. They'll
- They'll do as I say.

02:12.606 --> 02:14.606
Beowulf is in command.

02:15.686 --> 02:20.006
He was willing to die for you...
for all of us. Does that mean nothing?

02:21.446 --> 02:23.707
The only reason he's not in chains is

02:23.732 --> 02:26.110
because we need every fighter we have.

02:28.366 --> 02:30.366
Even traitors.

02:49.406 --> 02:51.406
I'm glad Rate didn't kill you.

02:51.446 --> 02:53.446
Well, that makes two of us.

02:57.206 --> 02:59.206
You wanted something?

03:02.206 --> 03:04.326
- I've been thinking...
- Careful.

03:08.966 --> 03:10.686
What were you thinking?

03:12.206 --> 03:13.686
(SIGHS)

03:13.726 --> 03:15.326
Maybe we could...

03:18.806 --> 03:22.326
- Maybe we could find a way to...
- (HORN BLARES)

03:29.966 --> 03:32.006
Anything is possible.

03:34.886 --> 03:36.246
Now, go.

03:51.046 --> 03:53.166
I should have held them
longer at that bridge.

03:53.206 --> 03:55.366
I should have died there.

03:55.406 --> 04:00.046
Whatever else you've done, you
put your father's sword to good use.

04:00.086 --> 04:02.206
Hrothgar would be proud.

04:02.246 --> 04:04.086
It's you who he wanted to hold this.

04:05.526 --> 04:08.966
Hrothgar's gone. You're his blood.

04:09.006 --> 04:11.364
Rheda will forgive in time. And one day,

04:11.389 --> 04:13.631
like that sword, Herot will be yours.

04:15.246 --> 04:17.046
But right now, we've a battle to win.

04:21.805 --> 04:24.246
It'll take time for
their army to assemble.

04:25.246 --> 04:28.286
We're protected on our
right by these cliffs.

04:28.326 --> 04:31.486
And our steep slopes to our
left mean any attack that way

04:31.526 --> 04:33.526
would cost them half their force.

04:35.006 --> 04:37.086
So they'll come at us head-on.

04:37.126 --> 04:39.126
- Ready yourselves!
- (CHEERING)

04:41.726 --> 04:45.206
I know what it is to be ignored
by a father who favours another.

04:45.606 --> 04:48.966
What it is to be always passed
over. How it can cripple a child.

04:49.006 --> 04:50.606
It didn't cripple you, did it?

04:51.686 --> 04:53.286
Men are weaker.

04:53.326 --> 04:55.326
Your father underestimated you.

04:56.246 --> 04:59.766
As you underestimate
Slean, again and again.

05:01.286 --> 05:05.326
What he did, he did because he
was robbed of his dignity by Hrothgar...

05:06.726 --> 05:08.726
of his future by you.

05:14.286 --> 05:17.326
He reached out for power because
he is ready for it.

05:19.046 --> 05:20.686
Step aside.

05:22.286 --> 05:24.086
Let him show you.

05:25.686 --> 05:27.686
Tread carefully, child.

05:35.206 --> 05:36.406
(SIGHS)

05:43.086 --> 05:45.406
An army of thieves.

05:45.446 --> 05:49.846
When the rest of their army
arrive, let them bring the fight to us.

05:51.286 --> 05:54.766
Herot. This time, I
enter as a conqueror.

05:56.166 --> 05:58.366
Not as a supplicant.

05:58.406 --> 06:00.566
Or a younger brother.

06:01.566 --> 06:04.486
Which one is Beowulf?
The one next to Slean.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.686
- And with him?
- Breca.

06:07.726 --> 06:10.126
Some thief he calls his friend.

06:15.966 --> 06:17.326
(SPITS)

06:18.526 --> 06:24.286
As you all wait patiently for the
rest of my warriors to gather,

06:24.326 --> 06:29.326
let me introduce to you some
of those who will end your lives

06:29.366 --> 06:32.046
and take your women.

06:32.926 --> 06:34.486
(CHEERING)

06:35.286 --> 06:37.046
Beltane!

06:37.086 --> 06:39.086
First of my warriors!

06:40.566 --> 06:43.326
Son of the fearsome Einar!

06:43.366 --> 06:47.566
Grandson of the great hero Greyblade!

06:47.606 --> 06:52.046
Beltane has already
cut down more than 40,

06:52.086 --> 06:55.246
40 of your Shieldlanders,

06:55.286 --> 06:58.366
- killing beasts with his bare hands!
- Spear.

06:58.406 --> 07:01.286
And single-handedly raising...

07:02.126 --> 07:03.686
Argh!

07:06.686 --> 07:08.686
No one likes a show-off.

07:28.406 --> 07:29.686
Archers!

07:39.446 --> 07:40.846
Beowulf.

07:40.886 --> 07:44.206
You swore your man would
see the Varni join us.

07:44.246 --> 07:47.846
Do two lone Norsemen
frighten the Wulfings?

07:48.406 --> 07:51.286
What brings you to
Herot? A change of heart?

07:51.326 --> 07:53.326
An offer I couldn't refuse.

07:56.646 --> 07:58.646
They won't make their attack yet.

08:02.966 --> 08:04.446
Rate.

08:04.486 --> 08:06.486
Thank you for coming.

08:06.526 --> 08:09.366
How could I refuse the
invitation Varr delivered?

08:10.366 --> 08:11.846
Varr.

08:13.566 --> 08:15.366
Rheda.

08:15.406 --> 08:17.406
Invitation?

08:19.366 --> 08:21.966
- I don't see your warriors.
- They wait on my signal.

08:23.046 --> 08:25.656
Rheda swore on her ancestors'
blood that if

08:25.681 --> 08:28.230
the Varni came to Herot's
defence, she...

08:29.246 --> 08:30.846
What was it?

08:30.886 --> 08:33.405
That I would take you as my husband.

08:36.885 --> 08:38.566
And the important part?

08:40.645 --> 08:47.206
That you and I would rule over
all the Shieldlands... as joint Jarl.

09:00.166 --> 09:03.286
The letter Varr delivered
was a last resort.

09:03.326 --> 09:05.686
Only he and I could know.

09:06.526 --> 09:08.806
- Are my people ready?
- They are.

09:08.846 --> 09:11.526
- And the attack?
- Will come soon.

09:15.646 --> 09:18.526
The things that happened... in the past.

09:19.526 --> 09:20.886
Between us.

09:20.926 --> 09:23.446
Lying to Hrothgar on Slean's behalf?

09:23.486 --> 09:25.486
Having me banished?

09:25.526 --> 09:28.526
You're more blunt than usual today.

09:28.566 --> 09:30.766
I did it to protect him.

09:32.646 --> 09:37.606
Why did you return to a
lying woman with a jealous child?

09:37.646 --> 09:40.526
- I came for Hrothgar.
- Hrothgar was dead.

09:40.566 --> 09:42.846
And you stayed. Why?

09:44.726 --> 09:46.566
You're my blood.

09:47.406 --> 09:49.366
You're my son.

09:50.806 --> 09:52.806
Nobody else knows.

09:55.846 --> 09:57.446
I'm the Reeve.

10:26.486 --> 10:28.486
We're not fighting today...

10:29.206 --> 10:31.286
for the iron they smelt in the pits.

10:32.286 --> 10:35.966
We're not fighting
for a thane or a jarl.

10:36.006 --> 10:38.006
We're fighting for family.

10:38.926 --> 10:40.926
For friends.

10:40.966 --> 10:42.646
For those we care for.

10:42.686 --> 10:45.406
For this walled piece
of dirt we call home.

10:47.446 --> 10:49.446
- For Herot!
- (CHEERING)

10:50.286 --> 10:52.326
Tell the smelters to stand ready.

10:55.766 --> 10:59.886
Today, we shall restore order.

10:59.926 --> 11:01.966
And rekindle strength...

11:02.646 --> 11:08.206
by marching together into the fire!

11:08.246 --> 11:10.246
(CHEERING)

11:10.286 --> 11:11.846

11:19.006 --> 11:20.926
Huskarla!

11:21.646 --> 11:23.646
(YELLS)

11:47.276 --> 11:49.116
The gate is holding!

11:49.156 --> 11:50.996
Take positions!

11:52.276 --> 11:54.356
- Slean!
- I'll stay here till I die!

11:54.396 --> 11:55.516
Move! Now!

11:58.436 --> 12:00.316
What are we waiting for?

12:00.356 --> 12:02.356
The bride must prepare.

12:04.556 --> 12:06.356
Send for the Varni warriors now.

12:08.556 --> 12:11.276
Not until I have what I came for.

12:20.796 --> 12:22.436
Hold the pulley.

12:33.956 --> 12:35.596
On three... release.

12:35.636 --> 12:37.636
Two... three!

12:45.116 --> 12:46.716
Release.

13:00.636 --> 13:02.636
Hold!

13:38.196 --> 13:40.196
Well, I smell victory.

13:44.156 --> 13:46.156
I won't wait any longer!

13:48.756 --> 13:51.676
Abrecan's army have
almost reached the smelting pits.

13:52.396 --> 13:54.836
Now send for your
men. I'm not married yet.

13:55.716 --> 13:57.916
Don't be a fool. You have my word.

13:57.956 --> 14:01.436
Rheda, you will marry me or Herot
will burn. Do not doubt my resolve.

14:01.476 --> 14:03.469
You married your son
off for Herot's sake.

14:03.494 --> 14:05.276
Surely you'd make the same sacrifice.

14:05.316 --> 14:07.267
There can be no truth-telling ceremony.

14:07.292 --> 14:08.876
They're fighting by the stones.

14:08.916 --> 14:10.336
I brought a Varni so we could be

14:10.361 --> 14:12.156
married in accordance with our custom.

14:12.196 --> 14:14.716
Now, let us begin!

14:31.676 --> 14:34.236
Come on!

14:53.196 --> 14:54.716
You have the bride's gift?

14:57.949 --> 15:01.756
If you were my wife, I
would always hunt for you.

15:01.796 --> 15:04.598
You will never go
hungry. Do you accept this

15:04.623 --> 15:07.300
meat from my best
horse as proof of this?

15:10.299 --> 15:12.796
How could I turn it down?

15:22.276 --> 15:23.316
Urgh!

15:23.356 --> 15:27.196
Get him! Get him now! Argh! Argh!

15:28.956 --> 15:30.836
You.

15:36.396 --> 15:38.796
Wanna try your luck?

15:45.356 --> 15:47.356

15:54.516 --> 15:56.796
Wait. Now!

16:08.916 --> 16:11.876
Mudborn braves.

16:11.916 --> 16:13.956
Say hello to my little pet.

16:19.916 --> 16:21.556
Let us out!

16:21.596 --> 16:23.596
Open the gate!

16:24.316 --> 16:26.316
(SCREAMING AND YELLING)

16:28.756 --> 16:32.516
If you are my husband, I will
always share my blanket with you.

16:32.556 --> 16:34.196
And...

16:34.236 --> 16:37.196
They are only words, Rheda.

16:38.516 --> 16:40.996
And bear you all the children you wish.

16:43.116 --> 16:44.676
Go! Go! Go! Move!

17:06.435 --> 17:07.915
Aaargh!

17:10.836 --> 17:12.836
We loot when we win.

17:14.636 --> 17:16.636
We must press the advantage.

17:27.396 --> 17:29.396
Back to the barricade!

17:32.556 --> 17:35.396
The Wulfing have almost
reached the barricade.

17:35.436 --> 17:37.756
Once your blood is
mixed, you will be wed.

17:37.796 --> 17:39.516
Then I shall summon my men.

18:15.036 --> 18:18.236
VISHKA: Come on! Grab
anything you can! Move!

18:22.236 --> 18:24.836
- Brinni.
- Look, I'm fine.

18:26.036 --> 18:28.036
I'll take you to Elvina's.

18:34.636 --> 18:37.876
Is Slean all right? They've
pulled back to the barricade.

18:37.916 --> 18:39.316
That's all I know.

18:41.836 --> 18:44.556
There must be wounded out
there. You need to see to them.

18:47.236 --> 18:50.156
I have to get back. Come with me.

18:53.356 --> 18:54.676
Vishka!

18:54.716 --> 18:56.716
Just take care of yourself.

19:07.116 --> 19:08.356
Slean!

19:10.316 --> 19:12.676
Rate is here. Rheda has
offered to marry him.

19:13.356 --> 19:15.556
What do you mean she's gonna marry Rate?

19:28.756 --> 19:30.276
Mother.

19:32.676 --> 19:34.676
- Have you no shame?
- Slean!

19:34.716 --> 19:37.996
Selling your body and my birthright.

19:38.036 --> 19:40.036
You have no birthright.

19:40.076 --> 19:42.996
You gave it up when you
joined your uncle in treason.

19:43.036 --> 19:46.236
Oh, for once in your life, can you
please just be honest with yourself?

19:48.396 --> 19:51.756
You never had any intention of
stepping aside for me, did you?

19:52.476 --> 19:54.956
I did. At first.

19:58.236 --> 20:00.236
Well, good luck to you.

20:04.596 --> 20:06.396
Slean.

20:06.436 --> 20:08.143
Slean, I swore to you I would do

20:08.168 --> 20:10.436
whatever I had to to see you were Thane.

20:10.476 --> 20:13.436
And I will. Whatever must be done.

20:17.196 --> 20:19.196
Whoever stands in your way.

20:34.316 --> 20:37.796
All that matters now
is that we save Herot.

20:44.116 --> 20:46.116
Time's short. Shall we?

20:50.916 --> 20:52.916
You are man and wife now.

20:55.556 --> 20:56.996
No kiss?

20:59.316 --> 21:01.156
Signal your men.

21:08.276 --> 21:10.476
VISHKA: Hold your ground!

21:15.556 --> 21:17.556
The Wulfings are behind us!

21:17.596 --> 21:20.356
Huskarla, hold your
position as long as you can.

21:20.396 --> 21:22.556
The rest of you, to the hall, now!

21:40.956 --> 21:43.127
The Wulfing are coming down the cliff.

21:43.152 --> 21:45.076
Move the wounded to the hall now.

21:45.116 --> 21:46.756
Do as he says.

21:47.796 --> 21:49.036
Get up!

21:49.996 --> 21:51.796
Move. Quickly.

21:59.276 --> 22:01.476
We can't hold them any longer!

22:02.276 --> 22:04.436
Pull back to the hall.

22:28.676 --> 22:31.236
Herot is ours!

22:50.756 --> 22:52.796
Leave her alone. Breca, behind you!

22:56.756 --> 22:58.826
- Agh!
- You wanted what's ours?

22:58.851 --> 23:00.180
Now you have it.

23:01.956 --> 23:03.876
Thank you. Breca!

23:14.876 --> 23:17.236
Oh, Breca.

23:18.276 --> 23:20.436
They'll kill you for this.

23:20.476 --> 23:24.516
Hold your tongue or I
will make him suffer.

23:25.076 --> 23:27.076
Listen to him, Lila. For me.

23:27.116 --> 23:28.396
Yes.

23:30.436 --> 23:34.843
Tell Beowulf that Skellan did this.

23:36.596 --> 23:39.276
And it isn't half of what he owes...

23:39.316 --> 23:41.316
for killing my brother.

23:43.676 --> 23:44.916
Yes.

23:46.956 --> 23:48.956
(BLADE CLATTERS ON THE FLOOR)

23:56.676 --> 23:58.876
- I'll go get help.
- Lila.

24:26.516 --> 24:28.556
(ELVINA YELPS)

24:29.956 --> 24:32.036
Aaarghh!

24:36.516 --> 24:38.556
(ELVINA SHRIEKS)

24:41.236 --> 24:42.876
(CHOKES)

24:45.516 --> 24:47.276
(ROARS)

24:47.316 --> 24:49.036
She's a Skinshifter!

24:52.436 --> 24:54.796
Get out! And not a word to anyone!

25:03.596 --> 25:05.596
You murdered your protector.

25:10.676 --> 25:13.716
Leave. I'll come.

25:17.396 --> 25:20.716
You killed... for that thing!

25:20.756 --> 25:23.196
That thing has a name.

25:24.236 --> 25:25.956
A name I gave it.

25:27.076 --> 25:28.316
Grendel.

25:28.356 --> 25:30.276
He's my son.

25:44.036 --> 25:46.036
(ROAR OF BATTLE)

25:53.116 --> 25:54.716
Vishka!

25:55.556 --> 25:57.156
Vishka!

25:58.836 --> 26:01.396
- What is it?
- It's Breca. He's hurt.

26:01.436 --> 26:03.396
- Where is he?
- In the Reeve's hut.

26:03.436 --> 26:06.036
I'll help him. Take your
mother to the hall now!

26:08.716 --> 26:09.956
Move!

26:14.876 --> 26:16.956
We have to get you out of here. No.

26:16.996 --> 26:18.796
(PANTING)

26:19.556 --> 26:21.156
This is it.

26:24.156 --> 26:27.036
Being good never worked out well for me.

26:30.436 --> 26:32.436
You'll enter the Halls of the Dead...

26:33.996 --> 26:36.116
have a place among the heroes.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.916
Droning on about honour and bloodlines.

26:41.636 --> 26:44.236
I have no honour and no father.

26:48.236 --> 26:51.316
I should say I'm sorry for
all the bad things I've done.

26:52.636 --> 26:54.636
But I've enjoyed doing them too much.

26:54.676 --> 26:56.756
(LAUGHS)

26:56.796 --> 26:58.796
(GROANS IN PAIN)

26:59.276 --> 27:00.396
Skellan...

27:01.396 --> 27:03.316
the Wulfing leader...

27:06.436 --> 27:08.436
kill him for me.

27:11.436 --> 27:12.676
Slowly.

27:13.396 --> 27:15.396
I will.

27:17.796 --> 27:19.116
Beowulf...

27:19.996 --> 27:21.996
are you my friend?

27:25.476 --> 27:27.236
I am.

27:29.996 --> 27:31.996
I never had one before.

27:43.756 --> 27:45.636
Until we meet again...

27:46.636 --> 27:48.636
on the far side, my friend.

28:29.836 --> 28:31.636
Skellan!

28:35.436 --> 28:37.356
- Aarrgh!

that beam down! Push!

28:59.236 --> 29:00.556
(SOBS)

29:20.076 --> 29:22.076
Pull it down.

29:35.036 --> 29:37.036
Leave us.

29:46.316 --> 29:48.316
Would your new master approve?

29:53.876 --> 29:55.876
How's your new life?

29:57.636 --> 29:59.636
It's the one I chose.

30:24.436 --> 30:26.436
This is mine.

30:29.596 --> 30:31.596
(POUNDING AT DOOR)

30:33.276 --> 30:35.139
Do you remember how we used to practise

30:35.164 --> 30:36.700
our blade work in this chamber?

30:38.236 --> 30:40.236
How Hrothgar would watch...

30:42.516 --> 30:43.836
judge.

30:46.596 --> 30:48.596
I remember.

30:53.876 --> 30:55.876
Beowulf, you are my brother...

30:59.516 --> 31:01.516
in everything but blood.

31:02.956 --> 31:04.796
Stop!

31:06.156 --> 31:09.316
Stop wasting your time.

31:10.276 --> 31:13.396
They're almost in. Why stop now?

31:14.156 --> 31:17.316
Set the hall alight.
Burn it to the ground.

31:17.356 --> 31:20.636
The doors are almost
broken. We storm it.

31:20.676 --> 31:24.716
Let the flames take those
inside. We will pick the molten gold...

31:25.876 --> 31:27.876
from their bones.

31:30.596 --> 31:32.596
Kill them all!

31:33.556 --> 31:36.036
Except Beowulf. He's mine.

31:37.556 --> 31:39.556
That wasn't the agreement.

31:39.596 --> 31:43.476
What agreement? I'm a Wulfing, huh?

31:45.036 --> 31:47.196
Those are my people in there.

31:47.636 --> 31:49.796
As much as those of Bregan.

31:49.836 --> 31:51.956
I see no love for you here, Abrecan.

31:52.836 --> 31:58.196
If you rule this place,
you will only rule ashes.

32:00.556 --> 32:02.356
Pick it up!

32:02.956 --> 32:05.556
Break the doors down!

32:06.796 --> 32:08.916
(POUNDING CONTINUES)

32:12.276 --> 32:14.276
No. No. No. No.

32:15.076 --> 32:17.076
Let him die with his people.

32:28.756 --> 32:30.556
The Varni!

32:30.596 --> 32:33.116
Wulfings to the main gate!

32:34.196 --> 32:35.796
Ready?

32:44.796 --> 32:46.596
Attack!

32:55.596 --> 32:58.196
ABRECAN: Let the
Wulfings fight the Varni.

32:58.956 --> 33:01.156
Break down the doors!

33:04.196 --> 33:06.196
(POUNDING RESONATES)

33:06.236 --> 33:08.076
Open the doors.

33:09.116 --> 33:11.476
Rheda, they'll kill us all.

33:11.516 --> 33:13.756
They'll be in here soon anyway.

33:17.636 --> 33:19.636
I'll do this my way.

33:28.516 --> 33:30.596
Hold your ground! Hold your ground!

33:32.676 --> 33:35.836
Hallam. It's Hallam, isn't it?

33:36.756 --> 33:39.276
I remember you from my days in Bregan.

33:39.316 --> 33:41.436
You were a fisherman, I recall.

33:43.876 --> 33:48.276
So tell me, what brings you and your
friends to call on your jarl?

33:50.356 --> 33:54.396
Is it that my brother
has told you I am weak?

33:55.236 --> 33:57.236
Too weak to face our enemies?

33:57.276 --> 33:59.516
Yet, here I am.

34:01.156 --> 34:03.156
And he is the enemy.

34:05.236 --> 34:07.876
So where do you stand? With a traitor?

34:09.036 --> 34:10.716
Or with your true ruler?

34:17.356 --> 34:20.476
I am their ruler, Rheda.

34:22.755 --> 34:24.716
Kill her.

34:29.275 --> 34:30.755
Kill her!

34:33.795 --> 34:35.396
Argh!

34:42.436 --> 34:47.396
Oh, look at you all.
So enthralled by her.

34:48.636 --> 34:50.436
Kill her!

34:51.315 --> 34:53.315
Kill her!

35:05.596 --> 35:07.396
Rheda.

35:07.436 --> 35:09.036
Argh!

35:11.956 --> 35:15.356
As I love you... please.

35:26.716 --> 35:28.276
RATE: Rheda!

35:28.316 --> 35:31.516
I think you might be
my... favourite wife.

35:42.556 --> 35:44.556
People of Herot...

35:45.316 --> 35:47.676
warriors of Bregan...

35:47.716 --> 35:51.116
let's not leave all
the glory to the Varni.

35:51.156 --> 35:52.556
Huskarla!

36:09.876 --> 36:11.516
Beowulf.

36:11.556 --> 36:13.036
Skellan.

36:13.796 --> 36:16.396
I was beginning to
think you wouldn't come.

36:16.436 --> 36:17.796
(CHUCKLES)

36:18.476 --> 36:22.036
You think I would leave without
your blood on my blade?

36:33.916 --> 36:35.236
(YELLS)

36:40.396 --> 36:44.356
I gave your brother what he'd
been asking for his whole life!

36:45.476 --> 36:47.036
Everything he deserved.

36:54.836 --> 36:57.676
My brother was a great
warrior, was he not?

36:58.676 --> 37:00.876
He died like a thief.

37:00.916 --> 37:03.396
That reminds me. How is your friend?

37:21.116 --> 37:22.716
(CHUCKLES)

37:23.476 --> 37:25.716
What did your friend die for exactly?

37:25.756 --> 37:27.036
Huh?

37:27.076 --> 37:30.396
To protect somebody
surrounded by a wall.

37:31.156 --> 37:35.596
Where's the glory in that, Beowulf?

37:39.676 --> 37:41.756
I'm gonna see you cry like a baby...

37:42.756 --> 37:45.356
watch your blood fill
these golden channels...

37:45.396 --> 37:48.196
see you beg me for mercy...

37:48.236 --> 37:50.996
as you wish yourself dead!

37:52.996 --> 37:54.116
Beowulf!

37:59.276 --> 38:01.116
(GRUNTS)

38:03.956 --> 38:05.956
That's for Breca.

38:06.356 --> 38:07.676
(GRUNTS)

38:11.996 --> 38:14.196
And that's for me.

39:17.116 --> 39:18.676
Thank you.

39:18.716 --> 39:20.876
This belongs to you.

40:03.156 --> 40:05.156
(SNIFFS)

40:31.916 --> 40:34.956
Thank you... for all that you've done.

40:37.236 --> 40:40.836
Without you, Herot would be
lost and the Shieldlands doomed.

40:41.956 --> 40:43.956
You played your part.

40:48.316 --> 40:49.916
I did, didn't I?

40:51.996 --> 40:55.436
Abrecan may be dead and
the Wulfings bloodied...

40:57.196 --> 40:59.196
but we're not safe yet.

41:31.076 --> 41:33.076
Great Master of the Giants...

41:34.556 --> 41:36.625
I have come to seek your help in

41:36.650 --> 41:39.276
driving mankind from the old realms...

41:39.316 --> 41:41.916
that they call the Shieldlands.
