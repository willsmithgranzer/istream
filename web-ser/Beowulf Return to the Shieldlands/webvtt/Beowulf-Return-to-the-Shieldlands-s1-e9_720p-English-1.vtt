42:36.240 --> 42:37.543
Why?

42:38.280 --> 42:42.000
To know our weaknesses before he tries
to force us from these lands.

42:44.640 --> 42:45.927
Was Elvina with you?

42:53.560 --> 42:54.702
Where is she?

42:59.920 --> 43:02.314
- Elvina's dead.
- (GASPS)

43:12.400 --> 43:14.196
How?

43:16.520 --> 43:17.537
Warig.

43:23.240 --> 43:25.091
The people are scared enough.

43:27.600 --> 43:30.280
We tell no-one of this. Yet.

43:59.560 --> 44:01.560
Breca...

44:05.040 --> 44:10.240
Just a precaution. I don't want
you killing me for coming back.

44:11.720 --> 44:13.170
Put it down or I will.

44:19.320 --> 44:20.704
I've had a bad day.

44:23.240 --> 44:25.240
It's going to get worse.

44:25.280 --> 44:28.280
Abrecan is going to attack Herot.

44:34.960 --> 44:36.600
Abrecan would never betray me.

44:36.640 --> 44:39.600
I heard him call for his
people to attack Herot.

44:39.640 --> 44:41.640
Prepare to fight our real enemy.

44:42.960 --> 44:45.280
You are all here to learn
to fight like Huskarla.

44:46.200 --> 44:48.880
Rheda, you're riding straight
into the arms of your enemy.

44:48.920 --> 44:50.720
I've been hearing things. About you.

44:50.760 --> 44:53.240
- Rumours.
- Run.

44:55.480 --> 44:57.323
- (ROARING)
- It's killed a human.

44:57.348 --> 44:58.920
We have to hunt it down.

44:58.960 --> 45:01.680
- Let's take it back.
- (ROARING)

45:02.680 --> 45:04.680
Beowulf! He's going to kill it!

45:04.720 --> 45:05.855
(YELLS)
