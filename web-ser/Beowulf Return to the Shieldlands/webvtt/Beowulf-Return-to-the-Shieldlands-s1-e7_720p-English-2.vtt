00:02.680 --> 00:04.800
- She died.
- This is all for nothing?

00:04.840 --> 00:06.840
We have a bride. Her name is Kela.

00:06.880 --> 00:10.760
I hear the Warig are
causing your father some concern.

00:10.800 --> 00:13.120
They killed my
mother, slaughtered our people

00:13.160 --> 00:16.040
- and no-one came to our aid.
- We're not prepared for an attack.

00:16.079 --> 00:20.120
There used to be a
stakewall. Guard towers every 40 paces.

00:20.160 --> 00:22.160
Then fix it!

00:23.640 --> 00:25.640
I knew it.

00:25.680 --> 00:28.160

00:28.200 --> 00:30.560
Whatever I have, you
find a way to take it.

00:30.600 --> 00:32.600
Heorot needs a real Thane.

00:32.640 --> 00:35.080
And the Shieldlands need a true Jarl.

00:35.120 --> 00:37.560
You could be one... and I the other.

(SHOUTS)

00:40.840 --> 00:42.840
(GRUNTING)

00:42.880 --> 00:45.280
We should light the
tower. Warn the other tribes.

00:45.320 --> 00:48.200
No. Leave the signal fire
unlit. We'll see how Beowulf fares

00:48.240 --> 00:50.480
if the raiders attack when
Heorot's not ready.

00:50.520 --> 00:52.720

Ah!

01:26.520 --> 01:30.360
The Draca Bridge. Built
by giants in old times.

01:30.400 --> 01:33.736
- Quickest way to Heorot.
- We'll be exposed.

01:33.737 --> 01:35.514
There won't be any
guards. Nobody's there.

01:37.240 --> 01:39.240
Always impatient.

01:42.160 --> 01:44.600
What if there are
guards hidden in the trees?

01:45.600 --> 01:47.720
- And what if there aren't?
- Enough.

01:47.760 --> 01:50.160
If we go around, it will
take a day or longer.

01:51.280 --> 01:54.120
The warning tower in
Bregan remains unlit.

01:54.160 --> 01:56.080
They think we've fled.

01:56.120 --> 01:59.243
And Heorot sits unwarned... unprepared

01:59.440 --> 02:01.600
and stuffed with gold.

02:03.080 --> 02:07.760
Draven is right. So
let's cross this bridge.

02:07.800 --> 02:11.240
Smash their hall and take their gold.

03:06.720 --> 03:09.240
Gorrik said the Worig are
preparing to attack.

03:09.280 --> 03:12.880
Someone is cutting the salts so the
trolls turn against the miners.

03:12.920 --> 03:15.920
All the salt in Heorot has
been sent to the mining camps.

03:15.960 --> 03:19.760
Well, that should hold them off
till I get back from Bregan with more.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.800
It would suit the Varni very well

03:21.840 --> 03:24.560
if the miners suddenly
needed their protection.

03:25.560 --> 03:27.320
That's all I need...

03:27.360 --> 03:30.040
for the miners to rethink
their arrangements with us

03:30.080 --> 03:32.080
and take their ore elsewhere.

03:33.840 --> 03:37.760
If the Varni are behind this, someone
in Bregan is helping them.

03:37.800 --> 03:41.360
I'll find out who but right
now we need to fortify Heorot.

03:41.400 --> 03:44.240
I know. I'm listening.

03:45.440 --> 03:47.440
Ditch on the outside.

03:47.480 --> 03:50.720
Earthworks on the inside
and a wall on top of that.

03:50.760 --> 03:53.280
When it's finished, it
should repel an army.

03:53.320 --> 03:56.040
But I need men to cut
the trees for the stakes.

03:56.080 --> 03:58.440
Men to shape them and... men to dig.

03:58.480 --> 04:00.480
You shall have them.

04:00.520 --> 04:02.520
What about weapons?

- Kela?

04:31.240 --> 04:34.440
I'm sorry... I didn't mean to pry.

04:34.480 --> 04:37.840
It was my husband's. It's
the shadow of his face.

04:37.880 --> 04:39.880
In gold.

04:39.920 --> 04:42.240
We took it from the ashes.

04:43.960 --> 04:47.240
There's so much gold
here. Even for the dead.

04:54.080 --> 04:55.552
What's this?

04:55.577 --> 04:57.784
I heard you were asking for weapons.

04:59.640 --> 05:01.640
These are mine.

05:01.680 --> 05:04.720
The balance is a little
closer to the hilt...

05:04.760 --> 05:06.760
than you're used to, I would think.

05:08.920 --> 05:10.920
Makes for a more agile blade.

05:17.480 --> 05:20.920
- The craftsmanship is excellent.
- The craftsmanship is Varni.

05:21.840 --> 05:24.440
- What did you expect?
- And you've used these?

05:24.480 --> 05:27.440
- In battle?
- A long time ago.

05:30.440 --> 05:32.440
I have no use for them now.

05:49.720 --> 05:51.400
- Well?
- I followed the Wulfings

05:51.425 --> 05:53.080
as far as the Draca Bridge.

05:53.120 --> 05:57.480
Good. So they are bound for Heorot.

05:57.520 --> 05:59.520
I've done dark deeds for my sins,

05:59.560 --> 06:02.440
knowing that the man who asked
them of me was good and true

06:02.480 --> 06:05.040
but that man would never
have allowed the Wulfings

06:05.080 --> 06:08.280
- to go against his own sister.
- I didn't ask for your advice.

06:08.320 --> 06:11.000
I know. Now you ask
for Hane's or Saray's.

06:11.040 --> 06:13.040
But I'm giving it all the same.

06:13.080 --> 06:15.360
You could be a great man still.

06:16.280 --> 06:18.480
But this path that
you've started down...

06:18.520 --> 06:20.640
it will destroy your soul.

06:33.600 --> 06:35.600
As Jarl of the Shields,

06:35.640 --> 06:38.520
I need someone to speak
in my place if needed.

06:39.480 --> 06:42.920
To be an ambassador in my stead

06:42.960 --> 06:46.160
and not twist my words
to suit their purposes.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.800
No. He hasn't.

06:57.720 --> 07:03.640
I think it's time someone
explained our customs and history to Kela.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
In detail.

07:07.040 --> 07:11.800
Over a long period of time,
away from other distractions.

07:11.840 --> 07:15.400
An ambassador is not a nurse-maid.

07:17.400 --> 07:19.400
Today it is.

07:26.280 --> 07:30.142
Golden Hall, Heorot. It's an ants' nest.

07:31.440 --> 07:33.440
Let's tear it down.

07:34.400 --> 07:37.520
Much better. No heavy lifting, I said.

07:37.560 --> 07:39.560
(SCOFFS) I'm a blacksmith.

07:45.640 --> 07:47.640
Thanks.

07:54.120 --> 07:56.440
- May I ask something?
- Of course.

07:57.440 --> 08:00.000
Erm... Beowulf and
Slean were fighting...

08:00.040 --> 08:03.440
and you stopped it. Does that
happen much? That the fight.

08:03.480 --> 08:07.320
Well... sometimes young
men are headstrong.

08:08.800 --> 08:11.800
Beowulf is the Reeve, while
Slean is the Thane's son.

08:13.040 --> 08:16.160
But still, he's allowed to
fight him and walk free after.

08:16.200 --> 08:20.200
It was just a quarrel between men. Nothing
of which to concern yourself.

08:20.240 --> 08:22.240
What was the fight about?

08:23.720 --> 08:26.240
Was it something to do with you?

08:26.280 --> 08:28.363
- Erm...
- There is a lot of history

08:28.388 --> 08:29.624
in any community.

08:30.600 --> 08:33.799

feel your way through all of it.

That's why I'm here to help.

08:36.640 --> 08:41.080

hear more but I have a headache.

better, I'll be right outside.

08:59.160 --> 09:01.160
Herself, it would seem.

09:05.120 --> 09:07.440
She's taken a shine to Brinni.

09:09.320 --> 09:11.920
It was not helpful...

09:11.960 --> 09:13.960
Slean brawling with Beowulf.

09:15.200 --> 09:17.720
Of course now the girl
knows something's between you

09:17.760 --> 09:19.760
even if she doesn't know what.

09:19.800 --> 09:22.640
Couldn't have all just
sat down and talked?

Once.

09:31.040 --> 09:33.040
But I learnt my lesson.

09:49.600 --> 09:52.520
I think we could get a good
edge on this if we wanted to.

09:53.680 --> 09:56.120
Or melt it down.

09:56.160 --> 09:59.800
The more the merrier. Any time you
feel like helping to carry this,

09:59.840 --> 10:02.840

19:32.974 --> 19:37.254
There's no alliance with the Mere.
I've done all this work for nothing!

19:39.694 --> 19:43.534
I told you... to watch over her!

19:44.774 --> 19:50.094
I don't care how you do it but
you will get... her... back.

20:33.854 --> 20:35.854
(STRUGGLES)

20:40.854 --> 20:43.534
- I should never have let him come.
- He was of age.

20:43.574 --> 20:45.574
It was his decision.

20:45.614 --> 20:47.974
He brought this on himself.

20:48.014 --> 20:51.254
They will trade for
this. I cannot leave him.

20:52.854 --> 20:54.854
No.

20:56.974 --> 20:58.974
You'd risk all our lives...

21:01.574 --> 21:03.469
- for him?
- I would risk

21:03.494 --> 21:05.718
no-one's life but my own.

21:07.854 --> 21:13.134
Go to the boats, lie
off-shore and wait for us there.

21:16.454 --> 21:18.454
I'm taking the girl.

21:29.174 --> 21:32.134
- We should've been there.
- Ugh.

21:32.174 --> 21:34.174
We should've had your back.

21:35.174 --> 21:38.734
Left it to Slean and Vlade.

21:38.774 --> 21:40.774
So where were you?

21:40.814 --> 21:42.934
I had my hands full enough.

21:42.974 --> 21:45.454
- Couldn't get to you.
- Agh!

21:45.494 --> 21:47.494
Stop wrenching the damn thing.

21:49.374 --> 21:53.774
Go. Saray will finish the binding.

21:55.014 --> 21:57.574
Ugh. (SIGHS IN RELIEF)

21:58.934 --> 22:00.934
You're a healer now as well?

22:02.894 --> 22:04.894
So full of surprises.

22:07.134 --> 22:08.743
- Ugh.
- What did I do

22:08.768 --> 22:11.358
to earn that man's dislike?

22:12.294 --> 22:15.414
- Don't worry about Hane.
- Treats your wounds...

22:15.454 --> 22:20.254
gives you advice. Should any man have
that much power over his Thane?

22:21.054 --> 22:23.054
Or any woman.

22:28.974 --> 22:32.054
Here. You should eat.

22:39.454 --> 22:41.614
If he wanted you dead, you would be.

22:53.174 --> 22:55.894
Have you never seen a Wulfing before?

22:55.934 --> 22:58.934
Yes. But not one so young.

22:58.974 --> 23:02.574
- I'm old enough to kill.
- And old enough to die, no doubt,

23:02.614 --> 23:04.614
with your life barely lived.

23:07.534 --> 23:09.534
It must be easy for you.

23:10.894 --> 23:14.294
Your soft life. Your comfort.

23:21.534 --> 23:24.854
- Any word on Kela?
- We think the Wulfings took her.

23:24.894 --> 23:27.734
Do you think they know she
was to be married to Slean?

23:28.734 --> 23:30.734

24:56.714 --> 24:58.714
- Now look at you.
- (SCOFFS)

24:58.754 --> 25:01.994
- I have something of yours.
- And I of yours.

25:02.034 --> 25:04.034
Then we'll trade.

25:05.034 --> 25:07.034
Your husband's mask for the boy.

25:07.074 --> 25:09.434
I would give up a Wulfing so easily?

25:14.274 --> 25:17.514
There's a girl. Return her.

25:17.554 --> 25:19.554
And the mask.

25:21.234 --> 25:23.514
She's important to you?

25:24.554 --> 25:28.154
She's a daughter of Heorot.
They're all important to me.

25:30.074 --> 25:32.074
Now let's get on with it.

25:32.114 --> 25:34.274
We're old enemies, not friends.

25:36.794 --> 25:39.674
Your husband would've
had more courtesy...

25:39.714 --> 25:41.714
even to an enemy.

25:45.354 --> 25:49.754
I was sorry to hear of his
death. He was a great man.

26:19.754 --> 26:21.754
It's your lucky day.

26:34.714 --> 26:37.874
So... you sent Slean back.

26:39.314 --> 26:40.777
- Yes.
- And he's comfortable

26:40.802 --> 26:41.802
with his role?

26:42.634 --> 26:45.114
- He is.
- Do you trust him?

26:46.754 --> 26:50.487
I trust he'll do what I
want. That we can use him.

26:50.634 --> 26:52.674
I trust his loyalty.

26:52.714 --> 26:55.994

- Saray is not what you think.

27:09.794 --> 27:11.834
And how do you know what I think, Hane?

27:11.874 --> 27:16.474
In the raid, I saw her
kill like a servant.

27:16.514 --> 27:19.474
No hesitation, no
remorse. What if she's a spy?

27:19.514 --> 27:21.737
- Sent by your sister.
- She's not.

27:21.762 --> 27:23.314
You don't know that.

27:23.354 --> 27:25.354
(DOOR CREAKS OPEN)

27:29.474 --> 27:31.474
We've just been talking about you.

27:32.994 --> 27:37.554
Hane thinks you're a spy sent
from Heorot by my sister.

27:37.594 --> 27:40.074
I told you he didn't think well of me.

27:42.154 --> 27:44.634
- I'm not a spy, Hane.
- No.

27:46.074 --> 27:48.074
You're a merchant's daughter.

27:52.674 --> 27:56.034
No. Not that either.

27:58.874 --> 28:01.074
Although, I never knew my parents...

28:02.074 --> 28:04.074
so perhaps it's true.

28:05.874 --> 28:08.274
Orphans make the best assassins.

28:09.634 --> 28:13.274
No family. No ties.

28:13.314 --> 28:16.314
And no-one ever suspects...

28:16.354 --> 28:18.354
until it's too late.

28:19.874 --> 28:21.033
You were hired to kill.

28:21.058 --> 28:22.394
- Never ask questions.
- Who?

28:22.434 --> 28:24.994
Just get close.

28:25.034 --> 28:28.634
With Abrecan... I got too close

28:28.674 --> 28:32.234
- and then I couldn't.
- Who hired you to kill him?!

tells you your target.

me, they'll kill me.

They'll have to come through me first.

- To throw us off.
- Then we follow.

be in a fight without a weapon?

31:48.952 --> 31:50.952

31:50.992 --> 31:53.632
the best weapon... is to think faster.

31:55.312 --> 31:58.592
- More Varni training.
- More a desire to live.

now. What do you want me to do?

Find the Wulfing ship.

Go to your ancestors in peace.

37:49.392 --> 37:51.712
Why didn't you warn
us about the Wulfings?

37:53.712 --> 37:55.001
There was nothing we could do.

37:57.392 --> 38:01.432
They cut through our
guard and... tore down the tower.

38:02.632 --> 38:05.112
You didn't send any
men to hunt them down?

38:05.152 --> 38:09.672
I thought they'd sail
home, not go to Heorot.

38:11.432 --> 38:13.432
How do you explain the salt?

38:19.312 --> 38:21.312
It was treachery.

38:22.472 --> 38:24.472
Of that there is no doubt.

38:26.232 --> 38:28.832
I sent more salt to Heorot...

38:28.872 --> 38:32.592
but Varni gold corrupts
even the best of hearts.

38:36.632 --> 38:40.032
Vlade was one of my most trusted men.

38:40.072 --> 38:42.072

38:45.712 --> 38:47.712
I know that now.

38:48.632 --> 38:50.672
And he tampered with the salt supply.

38:50.712 --> 38:53.112
As soon as I
realised, I put him under guard.

38:53.152 --> 38:55.232
I meant to give him up to you...

38:57.432 --> 39:02.712
but he escaped the guard and
then... he escaped his life.

39:04.872 --> 39:09.152
Perhaps the guilt was too
heavy for him to carry.

39:10.152 --> 39:12.152
Shame he isn't alive to talk.
