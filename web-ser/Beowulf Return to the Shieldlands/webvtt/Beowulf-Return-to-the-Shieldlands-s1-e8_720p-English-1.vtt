00:01.880 --> 00:04.320
I agreed to this
marriage to strengthen the tribes.

00:04.360 --> 00:07.440
If war lies ahead, then we'll all
be thankful for it... even Slean.

00:07.480 --> 00:09.840
I can't think of
anything worse than being in love.

00:09.880 --> 00:12.240
Who said anything about
love? This is about power.

00:12.280 --> 00:14.120
I don't like this place.

00:14.160 --> 00:16.760
Then go home. Face that lynch mob.

00:16.800 --> 00:18.680
There are two sides to every story.

00:18.720 --> 00:20.880
The Shieldings need a true Jarl.

00:20.920 --> 00:23.520
You could be one and I the other.

00:23.560 --> 00:26.240
Whoever's behind this
is a man and a traitor.

00:26.280 --> 00:29.160
A traitor in Herot? I don't think so.

00:39.680 --> 00:43.840
- Who's that?
- Abrecan's woman.

00:48.800 --> 00:50.960
Let's go.

00:56.160 --> 00:58.200
- Saray.
- Rheda.

00:58.240 --> 01:00.360
I'm so pleased to finally meet you.

01:00.400 --> 01:02.560
How's Abrecan?

01:02.600 --> 01:04.560
- His wound?
- That's better.

01:04.599 --> 01:09.480
He asked I stand for him at
Slean's union with Keela.

01:09.520 --> 01:12.280
Saray, you are my brother's love.

01:12.320 --> 01:15.400
And so you are my sister.

01:17.720 --> 01:21.080
You must have seen places much grander
than this in the Farlands.

01:21.120 --> 01:23.960
- None ruled by a woman.
- (LAUGHS)

01:28.000 --> 01:31.400
You must each choose a
second to be your companion

01:31.440 --> 01:34.640
and look after your
interests during the rituals.

01:34.680 --> 01:38.000
And you'll attend your
binding of friends and kin.

01:38.040 --> 01:43.160
- I have no kin here.
- My mother and others will join you.

01:43.200 --> 01:46.920
Then tomorrow we'll meet at the grey
stones for the truth telling.

01:46.960 --> 01:49.640
And after that, it's all over with.

01:51.200 --> 01:54.680
Keela, this is Saray from Bregan.

01:54.720 --> 01:58.640
- You know my son.
- Your bride is beautiful.

01:58.680 --> 02:01.720
Thank you. If you'll excuse me.

02:04.920 --> 02:08.080
Rheda, must I be guarded all the time?

02:08.120 --> 02:11.320
Your marriage to my son must go ahead

02:11.360 --> 02:13.760
or your father will
revoke his support for me

02:13.800 --> 02:18.040
and the other Thanes will question
my right to be Jarl of the Shieldlands.

02:18.080 --> 02:21.120
I don't really understand such things.

02:21.160 --> 02:24.800
But I do know that I must marry Slean.

02:24.840 --> 02:27.640
And I know I will come to love him.

02:27.680 --> 02:29.920
SLEAN: Why are you here, Hane?

02:29.960 --> 02:32.240
For your wedding.

02:32.280 --> 02:34.280
(ARMOUR CLANKS)

02:37.880 --> 02:40.520
And to see you play the good son.

02:40.560 --> 02:43.360
As your uncle requested.

(DOOR SHUTS)

02:57.120 --> 03:00.440
Perfume for the bride.

03:00.480 --> 03:03.120
Milked from a lake viper.

03:03.160 --> 03:05.360
It only has to touch her skin.

03:05.400 --> 03:08.360
She'll be dead in moments.

03:08.400 --> 03:12.120
This wedding cannot take place.

03:12.160 --> 03:14.880
Abrecan is counting on you.

- Why?

04:34.000 --> 04:36.160
What's it to you?

04:36.200 --> 04:38.480
- I'm the Reeve.
- Then we're looking for work.

04:38.520 --> 04:41.360
- What's your trade?
- Carpenters.

04:41.400 --> 04:44.680
Then they can use you on the wall.

04:44.720 --> 04:46.760
I'm going there now, why don't you come?

04:46.800 --> 04:48.720
Maybe tomorrow.

04:51.800 --> 04:53.800
Who are you?

04:57.920 --> 04:59.920
A friend of the Reeve.

05:02.160 --> 05:04.000
Do you have any other friends?

05:04.040 --> 05:06.800
Like I said, I've things to attend to.

05:21.520 --> 05:24.120
That him?

05:24.160 --> 05:26.480
The other one's the Reeve.

05:26.520 --> 05:29.200
Have to re-think how we handle it.

05:34.320 --> 05:36.320
(SHARPENS KNIFE)

05:40.920 --> 05:43.280
- Elvina.
- No, it's me.

05:43.320 --> 05:45.320
Saray.

05:47.120 --> 05:51.160
- I'm meant to give you this.
- Oh.

05:51.200 --> 05:54.800
Varr said I can't accept gifts.

05:54.840 --> 05:58.040
It'll be our secret, then.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.600
All brides should smell
sweet for their wedding.

06:03.640 --> 06:07.320
But remember... it's our secret.

06:32.280 --> 06:34.120
Sit down.

06:34.160 --> 06:38.480
We'll take what we came for while
they're nursing sore heads.

06:38.520 --> 06:40.680
(DOOR OPENS)

06:40.720 --> 06:42.720
You wanted to talk?

06:51.240 --> 06:53.560
I need a second.

06:53.600 --> 06:56.200
To support me.

06:58.920 --> 07:00.920
You're serious?

07:00.960 --> 07:04.120
Call it building bridges.

07:08.200 --> 07:10.200
All right.

07:18.280 --> 07:21.640
Keela, it's time for your rituals.

07:26.480 --> 07:30.440
Elvina, will you be my second?

07:30.480 --> 07:32.480

07:38.680 --> 07:41.400
I like the dress. Very fetching.

From the bride.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.600
For the game.

07:46.640 --> 07:48.840
We need to meet.

07:48.880 --> 07:52.360
Discuss any reasons the
marriage shouldn't go ahead.

07:52.400 --> 07:55.600
If we don't fulfil our
duties, their union could be void.

07:55.640 --> 07:56.917
- Go away.
- The future of the

07:56.942 --> 07:58.440
Shieldlands depends upon it.

07:58.480 --> 08:01.520
- All right.

Please?

08:48.760 --> 08:51.000
Oh, the cloth absorbs the smell.

08:52.600 --> 08:56.360
- Use your fingers.
- Of course.

09:03.440 --> 09:06.800
- I'm so sorry.
- It was a mistake.

That's all.

12:12.160 --> 12:13.960
So are they ready for this marriage?

12:14.000 --> 12:16.760
I see no season why Slean shouldn't
marry Keela, do you?

12:16.800 --> 12:18.880
He's still in love with you.

12:18.920 --> 12:20.920
Isn't that a reason?

12:20.960 --> 12:24.240
No, I don't think it is.

12:24.280 --> 12:28.360
He must put his own feelings
aside and do what is best for all.

12:28.400 --> 12:32.440
Would you put aside what you
want for the sake of others?

12:32.480 --> 12:34.480
It's what we all must do.

12:36.040 --> 12:39.880
If a man or a woman spends their
whole life pleasing others,

12:39.920 --> 12:41.960
then they're not living at all.

12:44.480 --> 12:46.480
Be yourself.

12:46.520 --> 12:48.520
Or nothing at all.

12:50.320 --> 12:54.480
It must be very
liberating to think like that.

12:57.200 --> 12:59.200
Try it.

13:24.360 --> 13:26.360
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

13:42.280 --> 13:44.920
VARR: Tell a truth at each stone.

13:44.960 --> 13:46.840
Only then can you look upon one another

13:46.880 --> 13:48.960
and light the fire signifying
your union.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.760
You will then be man and wife.

13:58.160 --> 14:00.160
Have you ever loved anyone?

14:02.320 --> 14:04.320
No.

14:07.040 --> 14:09.720
Do you really want to marry me?

14:09.760 --> 14:12.520
Yes. With all my heart.

14:14.720 --> 14:17.560
I thought before I came
here that you would be...

14:20.520 --> 14:25.320
In Mere, they say that all
the men in Herot are filthy

14:25.360 --> 14:27.840
and smell of charcoal.

14:27.880 --> 14:29.880

I wish we'd known each other then.

14:36.720 --> 14:38.720
When we were young.

14:47.240 --> 14:49.240
Do you want to be Thane?

14:49.280 --> 14:51.280
Argh!

14:56.200 --> 14:58.200
Argh!

15:02.960 --> 15:06.040
What are you doing? I have to do this.

15:09.280 --> 15:12.120
This is what you want. If
she dies, you'll be Thane.

15:12.160 --> 15:14.240
This was never planned.

15:14.280 --> 15:16.400
She's innocent to all this.

15:18.200 --> 15:21.880
Tell my uncle I am done with him.

15:21.920 --> 15:24.440
Go.

15:24.480 --> 15:26.480
Go!

15:26.520 --> 15:28.520
Get out!

15:45.560 --> 15:47.560
Are you all right?

15:49.320 --> 15:51.320
She tried to kill me.

15:53.280 --> 15:55.280
You let her go.

15:55.320 --> 15:58.000
- We must go back.
- No.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.120
We aren't done here.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.880
Don't you understand?

16:01.920 --> 16:04.400
I've betrayed my mother, I've
plotted with my uncle.

16:04.440 --> 16:06.160
That woman was sent here to kill you!

16:06.200 --> 16:07.880
But you saved me.

16:07.920 --> 16:09.920
Why?

16:09.960 --> 16:11.960
I don't know.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.080
You have no part in any of
this, you're just a piece being moved

16:15.120 --> 16:17.360
in a game of which
you have no understanding.

16:20.200 --> 16:22.200
Don't I?

16:34.640 --> 16:36.880
I killed my sister.

16:42.240 --> 16:45.960
She is the one who
should have been with you today.

16:54.280 --> 16:57.720
Even as the world turned to
dust, Mara had everything.

16:59.840 --> 17:02.320
People loved he because she was kind.

17:02.360 --> 17:06.119
My father loved her because
she was first.

17:08.240 --> 17:10.359
And she had Rowan.

17:12.680 --> 17:14.680
And then...

17:14.720 --> 17:17.599
the chance to escape.

17:20.560 --> 17:22.920
To never feel hunger.

17:22.960 --> 17:24.960
Or fear.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
To need for nothing.

17:31.680 --> 17:33.800
She died of a fever.

17:35.400 --> 17:37.400
She was recovering.

17:40.200 --> 17:42.200
I poisoned her.

17:47.440 --> 17:49.440
(CHUCKLES)

17:49.480 --> 17:52.440
Slean, I will never breathe
a word of what you have done,

17:52.480 --> 17:55.000
of what happened here today.

17:55.040 --> 17:58.320
Walk away.

17:58.360 --> 18:01.720
I owe you my life, you owe me nothing.

18:05.320 --> 18:07.320
Or stay.

18:09.280 --> 18:11.080
I can't.

18:11.120 --> 18:12.960
Because you love Elvina?

18:24.240 --> 18:26.240
We don't choose who we love.

18:26.280 --> 18:29.640
Or who loves us.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.680
But we can choose who we make our
way through this world with.

18:47.880 --> 18:49.880
Light the fire with me.

18:49.920 --> 18:52.640
You wish to be Thane?

18:56.800 --> 18:58.600
I can help you.

19:00.120 --> 19:04.560
Against whoever stands in your way.

19:24.240 --> 19:26.240

19:27.480 --> 19:30.840
They can't take it
away from you now, Rheda.

19:30.880 --> 19:35.000
With this marriage, you
are Jarl of the Shieldlands.

19:53.953 --> 19:59.113
These laws of the Jarl are
to be obeyed by all tribes.

19:59.153 --> 20:02.553
The life of a murderer will be forfeit,

20:02.593 --> 20:04.873
unless blood money is paid.

20:04.913 --> 20:07.833
A common thief will
be branded and cast out.

20:09.593 --> 20:12.473
Fixed prices on all
goods traded in the Shieldlands

20:12.513 --> 20:14.193
will be set by the Jarl.

20:14.233 --> 20:16.793
(CROWD MOAN)

20:16.833 --> 20:20.353
What right does she have
to set the price of fish?

20:20.393 --> 20:24.073
It is us who risk our lives
each summer to catch the pandiri.

20:24.113 --> 20:26.553
You should have told
me about these laws.

20:26.593 --> 20:30.073
You were where your people needed
you the most... at the watch.

20:30.113 --> 20:32.113
I could not disrupt you.

20:32.153 --> 20:34.393
You were distracted enough.

20:34.433 --> 20:36.433
Meaning?

20:36.473 --> 20:39.233
You need a clear
mind to see the pandiri.

20:39.273 --> 20:41.713
However, yours is with matters in Herot.

20:41.753 --> 20:44.313
When it should be here, with the sea.

20:44.353 --> 20:47.193
Abrecan, look around.

20:47.233 --> 20:50.033
Your people are nervous.

20:50.073 --> 20:53.713

think you missed them again.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.753
Is that what you think?

20:55.793 --> 20:57.793
No.

20:57.833 --> 21:03.073
But if you fail, Bregan will
have another poor, hungry winter.

21:03.113 --> 21:05.513
And your people will be unforgiving.

21:05.553 --> 21:07.833
The council will elect a new Thane.

21:11.393 --> 21:14.753
Go back to the watch. Your
people are relying on you.

21:14.793 --> 21:16.793
Forget Herot.

(SPITS)

21:45.673 --> 21:47.673
Argh!

22:07.913 --> 22:10.433
Hey!

22:10.473 --> 22:12.593
Get him out of here.

22:12.633 --> 22:14.633
We're headhunters.

22:14.673 --> 22:16.913
Breca's wanted for murder, you know it.

22:18.633 --> 22:21.553
- We act under law.
- I'm the law here.

22:27.193 --> 22:30.393
Kill him! Kill Breca now!

22:30.433 --> 22:32.433
Yaah!

22:34.393 --> 22:36.953
I'll do it!

22:36.993 --> 22:41.593
Stop, wait! Do that here without any
explanation and we're all dead.

22:41.633 --> 22:44.753
- The boy's name is Kye.
- Yeah, I know his face.

22:44.793 --> 22:47.873
He hired us to bring Breca to
law after he escaped the noose.

22:47.913 --> 22:50.553
If that's so, why try to
snatch him away, why not just ask?

22:50.593 --> 22:54.153
(LAUGHS) Ask the man who helped
him escape the first time?

22:54.193 --> 22:59.113
You're the Reeve here now,
Beowulf, and protector of these good people.

22:59.153 --> 23:01.913
So we'll overlook that.

23:01.953 --> 23:04.193
But we must have Breca.

(BRECA GROANS)

23:12.193 --> 23:15.873
Beowulf, believe me, I
didn't mean to kill anyone.

23:15.913 --> 23:18.113
Shut up.

23:18.153 --> 23:21.353
Given your interest, we
ask this man to be put to trial

23:21.393 --> 23:23.793
for the crimes he's committed.

23:23.833 --> 23:25.833
Get up.

23:32.393 --> 23:34.393
ABRECAN: You have failed me.

23:34.433 --> 23:37.073
Rheda is now Jarl!

23:37.113 --> 23:40.393
Herot could be moving
against our gates as we speak!

23:40.433 --> 23:43.793
When did we become the
killer of young women?

23:43.833 --> 23:45.953
What do you mean by that?

23:45.993 --> 23:48.633
We need a strong leader at the
heart of the Shieldlands,

23:48.673 --> 23:51.713
but if you are that man, then
take it like a warrior,

23:51.753 --> 23:54.353
shouting your
intentions for others to hear!

23:56.913 --> 24:00.433
You have hid in the
shadows for too long, Abrecan.

24:00.473 --> 24:04.153
If you want power, take it.

24:04.193 --> 24:06.193
But with honour.

Remember who you are speaking to.

24:19.113 --> 24:21.113

24:21.153 --> 24:23.393
The boy demands Breca's life

24:23.433 --> 24:25.793
or blood money for the
killing of his brother.

24:25.833 --> 24:27.873
You said it was a woman's husband.

24:27.913 --> 24:29.993
Detail.

24:33.113 --> 24:35.033
- I didn't mean to kill anyone.
- Hurry up!

24:35.073 --> 24:36.953
You, help!

24:36.993 --> 24:39.033

- Hurry up!

25:10.233 --> 25:12.033
This isn't done!

25:12.073 --> 25:14.753
I'll hunt you down to the
ends of the earth if I have to.

25:18.113 --> 25:19.953
Breca swept my ma off her feet.

25:19.993 --> 25:22.833
That's what he does... seeks
out widows he thinks have coin

25:22.873 --> 25:26.393
and then he steals it and
runs, this dirt-licker.

25:26.433 --> 25:30.153
Abandoned my mother and took off
with everything of value she had.

25:30.193 --> 25:32.473
So my brother pursued him.

25:32.513 --> 25:34.473
And it cost him his life.

25:34.513 --> 25:36.593
Breca, is it true?

25:38.753 --> 25:40.753
Breca!

In a way.

25:42.833 --> 25:45.633
VARR: The price for a
life is 50 silver coin.

25:45.673 --> 25:48.233
Do you have it, Breca?

25:51.473 --> 25:53.353
Take him.

25:53.393 --> 25:54.686
No!

25:57.482 --> 26:00.016
I'll pay the blood
money for the boy's brother.

26:00.073 --> 26:03.113
Lila, do you even have 50 silver coins?

26:03.153 --> 26:05.953
- I don't want coin, I want blood!
- Silence!

26:10.553 --> 26:14.993
You have until noon. The blood
money is paid, Breca will go free.

26:15.033 --> 26:17.113
You lied to me.

26:53.313 --> 26:55.313
Pandiri.

26:55.353 --> 26:57.353

Hurry, hurry, get across.

Harken wants to replace me because
I've missed the pandiri!

28:32.633 --> 28:36.233
You've failed me, Slean's
married Keela, Rheda is Jarl!

28:36.273 --> 28:37.993
You don't understand.

28:38.033 --> 28:40.073
Tell the council our
enemies are gathering,

28:40.113 --> 28:43.313
that your sister cannot rule,
that you want to save the Shieldlands.

28:43.353 --> 28:46.393
Tell them that's why you've
been distracted. Tell them the truth.

28:46.433 --> 28:48.153
The truth?

28:48.193 --> 28:51.393
The truth is I brought
an assassin into Bregan,

28:51.433 --> 28:55.113
I have been bedding a courtesan
and I have been a fool for doing so.

29:00.513 --> 29:02.473
This is Hane talking.

29:02.513 --> 29:04.513
Not you.

29:28.393 --> 29:30.393
Say it.

29:34.753 --> 29:36.753
Why don't you say it?

29:38.393 --> 29:40.393
Cos you're my mother.

29:48.553 --> 29:51.553
I'm sorry.

29:51.593 --> 29:54.113
I knew Breca had killed a man,

29:54.153 --> 29:56.753
but he spun me a different story.

29:56.793 --> 29:59.353
It's nobody's fault but his.

29:59.393 --> 30:02.593
Lila, no one would
think any less of you...

30:02.633 --> 30:04.513
Whatever he did...

30:04.553 --> 30:06.473
would have done...

30:08.833 --> 30:11.233
I can't let them kill him.

30:11.273 --> 30:14.433
In that case, take this.

30:14.473 --> 30:16.473
It's all I've got.

30:35.753 --> 30:37.753
You have it?

30:51.793 --> 30:54.353
This isn't 50 coins.

30:54.393 --> 30:56.393
There's not enough.

30:58.473 --> 31:00.273
You should know,

31:00.313 --> 31:03.393
the moment we're through that
gate, the boy'll finish Breca.

31:03.433 --> 31:06.273
And I'll hold him while he does.

31:30.073 --> 31:32.633
- There was enough coin?
- It's paid.

headhunting, Beowulf, it's better paid.

- Lila?
- Leave this, Beowulf, please.

- Thanks.
- You won't speak to Lila.

leave Herot, and you never come back.

is about Breca, you miss him.

I don't want to talk about him.

have to lie about training me.

33:03.912 --> 33:07.672
You know why. The Huskarla
way is for those born a Huskarla.

33:07.712 --> 33:11.032
Well, it's wasted on you. You
don't even wanna be one.

33:11.072 --> 33:13.072
Is that so?

33:14.872 --> 33:17.912
Now, you see, I knew
Huskarla were training today.

33:17.952 --> 33:19.952

Huskarla, from what I could see.

provide for your people.

40:25.752 --> 40:27.752
From Bregan.

40:27.792 --> 40:30.192
I didn't think I'd make it in time.

40:30.232 --> 40:32.232
Do I owe you money?

40:34.672 --> 40:37.592
You owe my mother an apology.

40:39.432 --> 40:42.952
But I'm a warrior and
honour is at stake.

40:42.992 --> 40:45.272
So I'll take your life instead.

40:45.312 --> 40:47.312
(LAUGHS)

40:50.592 --> 40:52.792
Go home to mummy, little girl.

40:54.792 --> 40:56.792
Argh!

41:03.912 --> 41:05.792
Hey there.

41:05.832 --> 41:07.832
(STABS HIM) Argh!

41:19.872 --> 41:21.872
I didn't need your help!

41:23.832 --> 41:25.832
Clearly.

41:25.872 --> 41:28.712
He made my mother sleep with him.

41:32.392 --> 41:35.432
Because she didn't have
enough money to save you!

41:37.232 --> 41:40.352
She told me after you left,

41:40.392 --> 41:43.592
so it was my right to kill him!

41:43.632 --> 41:45.632
(SNIFFS)

41:45.672 --> 41:49.112
Be thankful you didn't kill him, Vishka.

41:49.152 --> 41:56.264
Blood on your hands is hard to wash off.

41:56.352 --> 41:58.352
(SNIFFS)

42:18.552 --> 42:22.312
The bridge is out. It's over.

42:22.352 --> 42:24.832
Without the nets in
place, the catch will be lost.

42:28.752 --> 42:31.392
No, it's not.

42:37.152 --> 42:39.152
Be ready.

42:42.152 --> 42:44.152
Abrecan, no!

42:44.192 --> 42:46.192
Hold that rope steady.

42:47.632 --> 42:49.632
Quickly, they'll eat you alive!

42:52.352 --> 42:56.232
Pandiri, pandiri!

42:56.272 --> 42:58.432
Abrecan, hurry!

42:58.472 --> 43:00.472
They're here!

43:00.512 --> 43:02.512
Pandiri, pandiri!

43:09.112 --> 43:11.432
Right, give him
slack. Quickly, everybody!

43:11.472 --> 43:13.472
Keep going!

43:32.792 --> 43:34.792
Hold it tight!

43:42.992 --> 43:45.192
Now tighten it up! Pull!

43:47.672 --> 43:49.672
(ROARS)

44:04.712 --> 44:10.232
Look at this. A catch
they will sing songs about.

44:10.272 --> 44:13.992
- (CHEER)
- A catch you brought in.

44:14.032 --> 44:17.672
For those of you who
followed and believed,

44:17.712 --> 44:19.832
I thank you.

44:21.472 --> 44:24.112
And for those of you who didn't,

44:24.152 --> 44:28.792
I am here to tell
you I am Bregan's Thane!

44:28.832 --> 44:31.072
- (CHEER)
- I have a vision for us.

44:31.112 --> 44:35.072
To be the greatest
tribe in all the Shieldlands!

44:35.112 --> 44:41.712
Who won't follow laws set down by
a Jarl who can barely lift a sword.

44:41.752 --> 44:45.872
But to do this, I need you

44:45.912 --> 44:48.392
to help me, to follow me,

44:48.432 --> 44:52.072
to fight with me, to battle with Herot.

44:55.552 --> 44:58.072
- Who is with me?
- (CHEER)

44:58.112 --> 44:59.992
- Who will follow me?
- (CHEER)

45:00.032 --> 45:03.472
- Who will fight for me?
- (CHEER)

45:03.512 --> 45:08.133
CROWD: Abrecan, Abrecan, Abrecan!

45:10.912 --> 45:14.312
I need to warn Beowulf.

45:17.752 --> 45:19.752
(CHEERS)

45:28.912 --> 45:30.912
Bregan!

45:34.032 --> 45:36.512
I told her not to go
alone. It's dangerous out there.

45:36.552 --> 45:38.432
Elvina!

45:38.472 --> 45:40.152
Where did you find it?

45:40.192 --> 45:42.112
With two others, in
the woods to the east.

45:42.152 --> 45:43.872
(SNARLS)

45:43.912 --> 45:45.632
Elvina!

45:45.672 --> 45:49.032
The war bands are coming together.

45:49.072 --> 45:53.592
This time, they mean to
destroy us. All of us.

45:53.632 --> 45:55.344
Beowulf!

45:56.305 --> 46:02.408
