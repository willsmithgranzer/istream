03:18.800 --> 03:21.240
I'm Hrothgar.

What's your name?

The people will remember it.

03:48.960 --> 03:51.720

03:51.800 --> 03:55.500
Why come so far to watch an old thane die?

03:56.560 --> 03:58.500
We parted badly.

04:00.360 --> 04:03.100
I wouldn't leave it that way.

05:16.720 --> 05:19.960
Don't you bury your
dead in the Shieldlands?

05:28.440 --> 05:31.440
- A mud-born did this.
- A troll?

05:32.280 --> 05:35.680
The bite marks are too small and deep.

05:37.520 --> 05:39.550
There's no time to bury him.

05:39.600 --> 05:43.200
Not if we're to make Heorot by nightfall.

05:45.880 --> 05:47.470
I don't like this place.

05:47.520 --> 05:49.270
Well, then, go home.

05:49.320 --> 05:51.520
Face that lynch mob.

05:52.480 --> 05:55.880
It wasn't a mob. Just close friends
and family of the dead man.

05:55.960 --> 05:58.030
The dead man you killed.

05:58.080 --> 06:01.520
There are two sides to every story.

There'll be no more blood spilt
in this hall while I'm Reeve.

He was banished.

10:34.220 --> 10:36.660
You're looking at her.

10:36.740 --> 10:38.780
You're a girl.

10:42.740 --> 10:44.820
With a big hammer.

10:46.460 --> 10:50.100
Think you can fix this with
that big hammer of yours?

10:52.660 --> 10:55.200
If you pay upfront, I can.

10:55.580 --> 10:57.450
You don't think I'm good for it?

10:57.500 --> 11:01.900
Does being judged on your
appearance trouble you?

11:12.100 --> 11:14.890
Tonight we feast in Hrothgar's honour.

11:14.940 --> 11:18.140
May I see the body? To say farewell.

11:18.540 --> 11:20.970
Slean, whatever else
has passed between us...

11:21.020 --> 11:23.820
That is not my son's decision.

11:24.540 --> 11:26.420
I am Thane.

11:27.220 --> 11:31.660
Rheda, no family or friend can be
turned away from a man's last feast.

11:31.740 --> 11:33.740
You're neither.

11:35.860 --> 11:38.420
No. Let him stay.

me or not, you old goat?

as Thane of Heorot now?

12:33.300 --> 12:36.300
- You did this.
- He was trying to kill me at the time.

nomination as his successor.

passed you over, nephew?

13:01.900 --> 13:05.220
If they do, they do not
know your mother as I do.

13:05.300 --> 13:08.800
It was a bold choice your husband made.

- (GRUNTS IN PAIN)
- Quickly.

13:30.020 --> 13:31.890
It's his shoulder.

13:31.940 --> 13:33.340
I know.

13:35.780 --> 13:38.250
- All yours.
- Hold him.

13:42.660 --> 13:44.370
Tightly. He's not gonna kiss you.

13:44.420 --> 13:46.340
(CHUCKLES)

13:46.420 --> 13:49.250
- It'll hurt a lot more going
back in but you'll live. - Ready?

13:49.300 --> 13:51.050
You're different to the old healer.

13:51.100 --> 13:52.410
One, two...

13:52.460 --> 13:54.380
Agh!

13:55.820 --> 13:58.410
- Different how?
- More violent?

13:58.460 --> 14:00.820
(CHUCKLES) Well...

14:00.900 --> 14:02.900
Move.

14:05.460 --> 14:08.060
Bandage his hand, will you?

14:14.340 --> 14:18.100
- Thought I might help.
- Or Bayen sent you to keep an eye on me.

14:18.180 --> 14:21.380
Well, you made quite the impression.

14:22.780 --> 14:26.140
- Why are you staying for the feast?
- You begrudge me food and drink?

14:26.220 --> 14:29.210
Would you to mind getting to
know each other somewhere else?

14:29.260 --> 14:32.300
That's it? No thanks?

14:33.820 --> 14:36.290
Well, you are the reason they're here.

14:36.340 --> 14:38.260
Fair point.

14:38.340 --> 14:40.170
Will you be at the feast tonight?

14:40.220 --> 14:42.090
Everyone will.

14:52.260 --> 14:55.540
Somebody's died and
there's a feast tonight.

14:55.620 --> 14:57.620
We should stay.

15:03.500 --> 15:05.700
It's your old thane.

15:06.700 --> 15:08.330
My sympathies.

15:08.380 --> 15:11.380
You almost sound like you mean it.

15:43.780 --> 15:45.940
He was a great man.

15:46.020 --> 15:48.820
Who left his son full of rage.

15:49.820 --> 15:51.930
At least Rheda is wise.

15:51.980 --> 15:54.780
But is she strong?

15:54.860 --> 15:57.220
She has us.

15:57.300 --> 16:01.100
I'll have Rheda ready. You
keep Beowulf from this chamber.

16:39.580 --> 16:41.580
Beowulf?

16:42.420 --> 16:44.960
- No married women.
- Hm?

16:47.460 --> 16:49.460
Love is blind.

17:02.180 --> 17:04.460
My husband's wake.

17:05.099 --> 17:08.540
And all I can do is curse him
for appointing me his successor.

17:10.940 --> 17:13.089
The dress, it's new.

17:13.140 --> 17:15.339
It's a little tight.

17:15.980 --> 17:17.890
You could've refused him.

17:17.940 --> 17:20.540
Let your son become Thane.

17:20.619 --> 17:23.250
Hrothgar was right. Slean's not ready.

17:23.300 --> 17:26.609
- (DISTANT CHEERING)
- They're waiting for you.

17:26.660 --> 17:29.210
You don't have to be Hrothgar tonight.

17:29.260 --> 17:33.620
Like a new dress, power
fits better with the wearing.

17:33.700 --> 17:35.540
Please!

17:36.700 --> 17:39.570
You'll become accustomed to it.

17:42.180 --> 17:44.720
May even come to enjoy it.

17:48.620 --> 17:53.340
Remember, before man
came to the Shieldlands,

17:53.420 --> 17:56.500
the only living things
here were the mud-born.

17:57.260 --> 18:02.820
Giants, trolls and the wolf-like barghest.

18:02.900 --> 18:08.220
All with black blood, all born
from this land's dark dirt.

Slean?

19:12.300 --> 19:14.170
He didn't succeed his father.

19:14.220 --> 19:17.540
It was Hrothgar's right
to name his successor.

19:17.620 --> 19:19.650
He always did have a sense of mischief.

19:19.700 --> 19:21.930
You don't think a woman can rule?

19:21.980 --> 19:24.020

else. Now let go of me.

Tarn.

19:46.940 --> 19:50.440
Your reeve's a little long in the tooth.

19:50.580 --> 19:52.930
Hrothgar relied on him.

19:52.980 --> 19:54.980
And I must, too.

19:56.620 --> 19:59.380
A widow.

19:59.460 --> 20:01.690
Her husband died six summers ago.

20:01.740 --> 20:04.210
She owns the smithy now.

20:06.180 --> 20:09.260
Our unwanted guest,
find out his intentions.

20:26.860 --> 20:29.660
This is Lila. From the smithy.

20:30.540 --> 20:32.930
I met your daughter. Forthright girl.

20:32.980 --> 20:35.780
She gets it from me.

20:35.860 --> 20:40.380
You're not looking to by five
lengths of iron chain, are you?

20:44.220 --> 20:45.770
Not really, no.

20:45.820 --> 20:47.820
Good.

20:48.580 --> 20:51.180
I didn't come here to work.

20:57.580 --> 20:59.580
How's the hand?

21:01.820 --> 21:05.320
Y-You can't enter the private quarters.

21:07.100 --> 21:10.140
Beowulf, you have no place here.

21:10.220 --> 21:13.460
Bayen. I just want to see Hrothgar.

21:13.540 --> 21:15.480
You heard Rheda.

21:16.380 --> 21:18.370
How many years were you a Shieldman?

21:18.420 --> 21:21.420
- 30?
- And Reeve for ten.

21:21.500 --> 21:25.660
Not only that, I helped him
teach his son, and you,

21:25.740 --> 21:28.330
one end of a sword from
another, if you remember.

21:28.380 --> 21:30.540
I do.

21:30.620 --> 21:32.650
So you know how it was between us.

21:32.700 --> 21:35.290
Hrothgar was like a father to me.

21:35.340 --> 21:37.810
You were a good learner.

21:38.180 --> 21:40.450
Good sword-hand, too.

21:45.860 --> 21:48.900
Slean, your knuckles are
white. Don't hold it so tight.

21:48.980 --> 21:52.140
Don't tell me what to do.
Who do you think you are?

21:52.220 --> 21:54.500
You'll not pass.

21:57.020 --> 21:59.490
You're nothing, Beowulf.

21:59.980 --> 22:02.330
Your father was nothing.

- Beowulf.

23:34.300 --> 23:36.700
I saw you.

23:36.780 --> 23:39.060
Talking to him.

23:42.900 --> 23:45.500
You don't own me.

23:45.580 --> 23:47.700
But I would.

23:47.780 --> 23:50.780
Your mother would never allow it.

him. He stood over the body.

witness and no motive.

Without one of these, a
man cannot be condemned.

27:12.920 --> 27:14.920
He had motive.

27:15.680 --> 27:19.200
Bayen turned him away
from Hrothgar's body.

27:19.280 --> 27:22.380
- He threatened him.
- Threatened?

27:23.120 --> 27:26.220
It was banter, between old friends.

27:26.920 --> 27:29.880
Do it here, quick and clean.

27:34.120 --> 27:37.240
Make your decision on the
present, not the past.

27:37.320 --> 27:40.000
As a thane, not as a mother.

27:40.080 --> 27:43.680
- She was never your mother!
- Be quiet!

27:46.240 --> 27:48.830
You're nothing, Beowulf.
Your father was nothing.

27:48.880 --> 27:52.640
- Stop it! Now!
- He tried to kill me.

27:52.720 --> 27:55.390
It was an unprovoked attack.

27:56.240 --> 27:58.670
Beowulf tried to kill my son.

27:58.720 --> 28:00.720
Our son.

28:04.800 --> 28:07.920
It will be done in the usual place.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.600
Before any who wish to see.

28:10.960 --> 28:12.960
That is our law.

28:27.120 --> 28:30.000
- Can I come?
- Not today.

28:30.080 --> 28:33.870
I've a long way to go and I
want to be back before dark.

28:33.920 --> 28:35.920
Next time.

28:38.120 --> 28:40.360
(CLICKS TONGUE)

29:17.680 --> 29:20.510
- Ah! My new daughter.
- I'm sorry?

29:20.560 --> 29:22.550
- Your mother and I --
- What did you do to her?

29:22.600 --> 29:24.390
Married her, then shared her bed.

29:24.440 --> 29:26.840
Isn't that your custom?

29:30.720 --> 29:32.920
LILA: Stop!

29:33.000 --> 29:35.470
What were you thinking?!

29:36.560 --> 29:38.200
I wasn't.

29:38.920 --> 29:43.120
I had my way, they'd kill
you with your friend.

29:45.480 --> 29:46.750
What?

30:25.720 --> 30:27.710
- Elvina!
- Easy.

30:27.760 --> 30:29.710
- She went that way.
- What happened to her?

30:29.760 --> 30:31.950
A mud-born beast, he chased after her.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.430
- Where?
- Past the corral.

30:33.480 --> 30:35.950
Toward the Western Wood?

30:42.880 --> 30:44.820
Took your time.

30:48.240 --> 30:50.040
Whoa! Steady.

30:55.160 --> 30:56.760
Stop them!

31:12.360 --> 31:16.460
RHEDA: Slean? What do
you think you're doing?

31:21.560 --> 31:23.790
If he's ever to take Hrothgar's place,

31:23.840 --> 31:26.070
he must be seen as a warrior.

31:26.120 --> 31:29.400
- As I'm not?
- Rheda, I...

31:29.480 --> 31:32.000
It's true.

31:32.080 --> 31:35.280
I may never wield a sword or
lead the Huskarl into battle.

31:37.320 --> 31:39.720
I'll never be Hrothgar.

31:41.240 --> 31:43.600
But I will rule.

Dead barghest. Beast killed it.

33:44.120 --> 33:47.160
- Found her here.
- And probably took her.

33:47.240 --> 33:50.110
- There's a chance.
- Beowulf.

33:59.720 --> 34:02.460
- Finish them.
- Oi, oi, me?

34:03.320 --> 34:05.390
I hardly know him.

34:07.280 --> 34:09.230
Hrothgar would be proud (!)

34:09.280 --> 34:11.429
Getting others to do your killing for you.

34:11.480 --> 34:14.190
One year you lived with us.
What do you know of my father?

34:14.239 --> 34:17.880
Come on, then. I won't
even put up a fight.

34:18.600 --> 34:20.830
Or do I scare you that much?

34:20.880 --> 34:23.030
If that's how you want it.

34:23.080 --> 34:25.080
He's got a knife!

34:28.040 --> 34:30.790
Before you get close enough
to use those, he'll be dead.

34:30.840 --> 34:32.840
Do it!

34:32.920 --> 34:35.710
- Anger makes a man of you.
- I'm not the boy you knew.

34:35.760 --> 34:37.760
No?

34:39.360 --> 34:41.900
You want him? Be my guest.

34:42.080 --> 34:46.380
Then go and explain to
his mother what happened.

Tell me this isn't about the girl.

35:48.200 --> 35:51.680
Not just her. I pledged to avenge Bayen.

35:51.760 --> 35:54.430
He's dead. What's it matter?

35:54.880 --> 35:56.950
More tracks. Deeper.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.070
It's carrying her.

35:59.560 --> 36:01.560
This way.

36:33.960 --> 36:36.710
How did men drive giants from these lands?

36:36.760 --> 36:38.720
Before my time.

36:51.160 --> 36:54.640
I heard giants ate human babies.

- Wives' tales.
- You're not scared?

He'll live.

cloud has a darker one behind it.

39:25.480 --> 39:27.800
There. Can you?

39:28.400 --> 39:32.150
- Where are you going?
- Bayen's body must be prepared.

39:32.200 --> 39:34.670
He's dead. What about me?

39:34.800 --> 39:37.880
Aw. (GROANS)

39:39.600 --> 39:42.510
Cut from the mud-born that killed Bayen.

39:42.560 --> 39:45.040
Not from any I've seen.

39:47.000 --> 39:53.120
Before it came here, the beast had been
slaughtering crofters on the Northern Road.

39:53.200 --> 39:56.600
A pretty story. But it proves nothing.

39:56.880 --> 39:59.710
Beowulf saved Elvina's
life and returned here.

39:59.760 --> 40:01.750
That proves something.

40:01.800 --> 40:04.200
Only that he wants her.

40:09.600 --> 40:12.600
You may look upon Hrothgar's body.

40:13.360 --> 40:15.360
Then you will go.

It should've been me that saved you.

40:36.120 --> 40:38.750
You already have. Many times.

40:38.800 --> 40:41.030
I'd have cut the beast's head off.

40:41.080 --> 40:43.750
Then I'm glad it wasn't you.

40:43.960 --> 40:45.960
See you tonight?

40:53.720 --> 40:56.320
Did you find the rosewater?

40:58.680 --> 41:00.680
Let me help.

41:11.200 --> 41:12.960
What is it?

41:28.680 --> 41:31.270
Worried I might steal something?

41:31.320 --> 41:33.590
If you did, I'd know.

There are no secrets
from me within this hall.

This hall will always
be your home, Beowulf.

42:15.800 --> 42:18.400
Slean is your half-brother.

42:19.240 --> 42:21.440
You're all my blood.

42:52.160 --> 42:54.160
Never did.

43:13.800 --> 43:16.400
Your brother will need you.

43:18.600 --> 43:20.800
'And you will come.'

43:24.960 --> 43:28.080
- What will you do now?
- Finish what I started.

43:28.160 --> 43:31.110
- Kill the mud-born.
- It wasn't the beast that killed Bayen.

43:31.160 --> 43:35.640
- How do you know? - The wound wasn't
inflicted by a beast. He was stabbed.

43:36.880 --> 43:39.670
- Bayen had enemies here?
- He was Hrothgar's reeve.

43:39.720 --> 43:43.080
Mine, too. All of
Heorot's enemies were his.

43:43.160 --> 43:45.030
And there are many.

43:45.080 --> 43:47.550
Even in a time of peace.

43:48.200 --> 43:52.160
Well, whoever it was, I'll find them...

43:52.240 --> 43:54.110
and kill them.

43:55.160 --> 43:56.670
It's a skin-shifter!

43:56.720 --> 43:59.190
People fear skin-shifters
more than other mud-born

43:59.240 --> 44:01.630
Because they can live
amongst us undetected.

44:01.680 --> 44:04.110
If word gets out, there will be panic.

44:04.160 --> 44:08.470
- Can you find the thing and kill it?
- If it's still here.

44:08.520 --> 44:11.270
I've been a walking, talking
dead man for 15 years.

44:11.320 --> 44:13.310
- Why are you here?
- The killer was mud-born.

44:13.360 --> 44:15.360
You can't think it's me.
