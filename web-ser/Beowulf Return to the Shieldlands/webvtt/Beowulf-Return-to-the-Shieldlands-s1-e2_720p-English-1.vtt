WEBVTT

00:03.380 --> 00:05.420
You're nothing, Beowulf.

00:05.460 --> 00:07.420
Your father was nothing.

00:07.460 --> 00:09.460
Kill him.

00:09.540 --> 00:13.220
There'll be no more blood spilt in
this hall while I'm Reeve.

00:13.260 --> 00:15.300
- I'm here to see Hrothgar.
- Hrothgar is dead.

00:15.340 --> 00:17.340
One Thane must rule us all. Why not you?

00:17.380 --> 00:19.585
Would you rather it was
someone else? I saw you.

00:19.587 --> 00:21.098
Talking to him?

00:21.100 --> 00:23.179
- You're different to the old healer.
- I know.

00:23.180 --> 00:24.019
All yours.

00:24.020 --> 00:25.660
A Mudborn killed Bayen.

00:25.700 --> 00:30.100
If I'm not avenged... I'll never
enter the Halls of the Dead.

00:30.140 --> 00:32.299
I will avenge you.

00:32.340 --> 00:34.780
The wound wasn't from
a beast. He was stabbed.

00:34.820 --> 00:36.420
You don't belong here. Never did.

00:36.460 --> 00:40.780
Slean is your half-brother. You're
my blood. My son.

00:40.820 --> 00:44.220
Herot will need you, and you will come.

02:10.020 --> 02:15.420
Today... Hrothgar, Thane of Herot,

02:15.460 --> 02:17.660
will enter the Halls of the Dead.

02:18.500 --> 02:21.339
But my husband is not lost to you.

02:21.940 --> 02:23.940
Take off your father's sword.

02:39.860 --> 02:41.860
Raise it.

02:43.060 --> 02:45.060
Higher.

02:47.060 --> 02:49.060
(cheering)

02:50.900 --> 02:52.900
(woman singing)

03:58.260 --> 04:01.580
Rate, the others might be
at Herot already.

04:01.620 --> 04:04.020
Ride ahead and tell Rheda

04:04.060 --> 04:06.620
the Varni Thane will come
in his own time.

04:07.540 --> 04:10.660
For now... I feel like fishing.

04:11.540 --> 04:13.540
(both laugh)

04:14.060 --> 04:16.060
Hyar!

05:15.660 --> 05:17.660
What are you doing here?

05:19.340 --> 05:23.340
- These are the Reeve's quarters.
- Now he's gone, what will you do?

05:23.380 --> 05:25.860
It's my responsibility
to find Bayen's killer.

05:25.900 --> 05:27.900
I'll leave you to it.

05:30.660 --> 05:33.060
Bayen used to talk about
you all the time.

05:33.100 --> 05:37.860
Mostly about how he thought Hrothgar
wished YOU were his son, not Slean.

05:37.900 --> 05:40.500
(chuckles)

05:40.540 --> 05:42.940
Old men like to tell stories.

05:42.980 --> 05:46.420
When people stop listening, they tell
them a little louder.

05:46.460 --> 05:48.460
Make them a little bigger.

06:02.140 --> 06:04.140
Beowulf...

06:08.820 --> 06:11.780
I never thanked you. You saved my life.

06:11.820 --> 06:14.700
I wasn't there for you. I was there
for the beast.

06:14.740 --> 06:16.860
Still... thank you.

06:18.340 --> 06:21.060
- May I ask you a question?
- Go ahead.

06:22.300 --> 06:24.620
Are you Slean's woman?

06:24.660 --> 06:27.140
Only, I saw him leave your
home this morning.

06:29.020 --> 06:31.100
You did?

06:31.140 --> 06:33.140
I did.

06:33.660 --> 06:35.700
I don't belong to any man.

06:35.740 --> 06:37.700
Then...

06:37.740 --> 06:39.740
We're close.

06:44.060 --> 06:46.580
- Is Breca awake?
- He has company.

06:46.620 --> 06:48.900
- Wife?
- Children.

06:48.940 --> 06:50.940
Quick, even for him.

06:51.460 --> 06:53.340
I'm feeling lucky.

06:53.380 --> 06:55.540
Feeling lucky.

06:55.580 --> 06:57.700
Oh, yes!

06:57.740 --> 06:59.500
Let me win back what I lost.

06:59.540 --> 07:02.180
- Won't happen.
- Her parents'll beat her.

07:02.780 --> 07:04.780
Really?

07:05.940 --> 07:08.260
- It's character-building.
- (door opens)

07:13.420 --> 07:16.380
Take what's yours and get out. And you.

07:18.580 --> 07:22.180
- (sighs) Children?
- Find me a proper game.

07:22.220 --> 07:25.140
If you want a proper game,
don't use loaded knuckles.

07:25.980 --> 07:29.500
I'm a married man. I've
got responsibilities now.

07:29.540 --> 07:31.220
(laughs) Up.

07:31.260 --> 07:33.180
The healer said I have to rest.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.940
Up. I need the mind of a murderer.

07:34.980 --> 07:36.780
I told you - it was an accident.

07:36.820 --> 07:39.500
What? (shouts) You mean, the
man you stuck a knife in... ?

07:39.540 --> 07:42.100
All right! All right.

07:44.740 --> 07:46.740
(groans)

07:54.980 --> 07:59.420
That mark on Breca's throat - you
know it's from a noose, don't you?

07:59.460 --> 08:02.060
Somebody had a reason
to put it round his neck.

08:02.100 --> 08:04.420
- What do you think you're doing?
- Living.

08:04.460 --> 08:05.717
Huh!

08:05.718 --> 08:07.899
Vishka, it's six years
since your father died.

08:07.900 --> 08:10.100
Why now? Why this one?

08:10.140 --> 08:12.460
Er...

08:12.500 --> 08:14.820
Vishka, we were going to...

08:14.860 --> 08:16.220
the snares.

08:16.260 --> 08:18.260
They need checking.

08:25.860 --> 08:27.719
(sighs)

08:27.820 --> 08:31.060
Hrothgar wasn't only Thane
of Herot. He was also Jarl,

08:31.100 --> 08:33.820
leader of all the tribes
across the Shieldlands.

08:33.821 --> 08:36.693
And, to succeed him, you need a majority

08:36.693 --> 08:38.779
of the votes at the
Gathering. I'm not a child.

08:38.780 --> 08:40.940
Then tell me how they'll vote.

08:40.980 --> 08:43.900
- The Thanes will be here by sunset.
- (metal scraping)

08:47.740 --> 08:49.820
The Wisdeth are farmers.

08:49.860 --> 08:54.140
They need our iron, our warriors.
Their vote can be counted on.

08:54.180 --> 08:58.540
Scorann is a good Thane and a friend
of Herot, but nothing can be counted on.

09:00.220 --> 09:02.220
Go on.

09:04.140 --> 09:06.300
Bregan is Abrecan's.

09:06.340 --> 09:08.660
And my vote is yours.

09:08.700 --> 09:10.780
And the forest people?

09:10.820 --> 09:12.980
The Banning Thane has
a weak spot for you...

09:13.740 --> 09:15.860
but his vote is uncertain.

09:15.900 --> 09:17.900
Which leaves the Varni.

09:20.580 --> 09:24.700
Rate wishes to see himself made Jarl
of the Shieldlands, instead of you.

09:25.340 --> 09:28.740
But, in order to do so, he'd have
to convince the others you're weak.

09:28.780 --> 09:30.780
So you lose the vote.

09:32.180 --> 09:34.180
And if I do... ?

09:34.540 --> 09:36.540
Rate could challenge you.

09:39.500 --> 09:41.820
You'd have to defeat him in single combat.

09:49.660 --> 09:51.660
Ah...

10:02.460 --> 10:04.460
(wails)

10:20.220 --> 10:22.220
What was that?

10:30.260 --> 10:33.900
Bayen's body was here.
Imagine you stabbed him.

10:33.940 --> 10:36.140
You make it sound like
I'm an expert at this.

10:36.180 --> 10:38.180
(door opens)

10:40.460 --> 10:42.260
Varni.

10:42.300 --> 10:46.540
Varr. They said you were licking
boots here, but I didn't believe that.

10:46.580 --> 10:48.260
Even of you.

10:48.300 --> 10:50.940
Take me to the woman
who claims to be Thane.

10:50.980 --> 10:54.100
Rheda will see you when she's ready.

10:54.900 --> 10:56.900
You may wait in her chamber.

11:04.660 --> 11:07.420
You said Bayen was
alive when you found him.

11:07.460 --> 11:09.380
If I was the killer,

11:09.380 --> 11:11.659
why would I leave him breathing,
with my name on his tongue?

11:11.660 --> 11:14.220
- You were interrupted.
- Or I was wounded.

11:17.420 --> 11:19.420
Then you'd have bled.

11:24.700 --> 11:26.700
(gasps)

11:28.580 --> 11:30.580
The black blood of a Mudborn.

11:31.260 --> 11:33.580
The one that killed Bayen?

11:33.620 --> 11:36.060
The beast carried no wound. I saw it.

11:37.180 --> 11:39.180
Then there were two Mudborn here.

11:45.580 --> 11:47.580
Leave us.

11:48.100 --> 11:49.194
Where's Rate?

11:49.195 --> 11:51.995
The Varni Thane will come when he's ready.

11:52.820 --> 11:55.540
I'm to see you're prepared for his arrival.

11:55.580 --> 11:57.780
Inspect his quarters.

11:57.820 --> 11:59.860
- Are you his handmaid?
- (door slamming)

11:59.900 --> 12:02.980
I'll have you shown there,
and you can turn down the bed.

12:06.620 --> 12:10.460
- You insult me.
- As your presence here insults me.

12:12.340 --> 12:14.340
But that's the point, isn't it?

12:20.420 --> 12:23.820
There's only one thing that's
blood can turn from black to red,

12:23.860 --> 12:26.180
that can shift from Mudborn to human.

12:27.700 --> 12:31.140
Tell him: if he wishes to be Jarl,

12:31.180 --> 12:33.180
he will have to do better than that.

12:37.180 --> 12:39.180
(grunts)

12:46.540 --> 12:48.540
- Rheda...
- I'm fine.

12:50.660 --> 12:53.540
- The thing that did this...
- ... was a Skinshifter.

12:53.580 --> 12:55.580
And it's living among us.

13:00.943 --> 13:02.011
How could you let this happen?

13:02.012 --> 13:06.252
Let this thing get into
my sister's private chamber

13:06.292 --> 13:08.332
and threaten her life?

13:08.372 --> 13:11.292
Slean's Huskarla are responsible
for the Thane's safety.

13:11.332 --> 13:13.332
(thud)

13:13.372 --> 13:16.572
If you'd done what I asked
and found Bayen's killer,

13:16.612 --> 13:18.252
this Varni wouldn't be dead.

13:18.292 --> 13:22.372
How was I to know it was a Skinshifter?
None have been found here for years.

13:23.132 --> 13:25.132
Leave us. Now.

13:32.372 --> 13:35.364
We're sure this Skinshifter killed Bayen?

13:36.572 --> 13:38.692
- ABRECAN: Well, if not...
- (door slams)

13:38.732 --> 13:39.892
... who else?

13:39.932 --> 13:42.612
People fear Skinshifters
more than any other Mudborn,

13:42.652 --> 13:45.292
because they can live amongst us...

13:45.332 --> 13:47.332
undetected.

13:48.332 --> 13:52.012
The Thanes arrive here in a
few hours for the Gathering.

13:52.052 --> 13:56.152
You'll never win their support
if you can't even control Herot.

13:57.252 --> 13:59.882
Then we ride out to meet them.

13:59.892 --> 14:01.692
Delay their arrival.

14:01.732 --> 14:04.332
Slean, ride west to meet Scorann.

14:04.372 --> 14:07.883
You and I, brother, will
ride north to meet the others.

14:08.612 --> 14:12.572
You swore you'd avenge Bayen's killer.
Can you find this thing and kill it?

14:12.612 --> 14:14.612
If it's still here.

14:28.812 --> 14:32.081
- (sighs)
- What happened to you?

14:33.332 --> 14:36.603
You expect me to run towards a Skinshifter?

14:37.452 --> 14:40.372
Give me a man to fight, or even a beast.

14:40.412 --> 14:42.412
But one that's both?

14:42.932 --> 14:45.372
What's that?

14:45.412 --> 14:48.412
It used it to kill the
Varni. Maybe Bayen, too.

14:51.332 --> 14:55.332
It's been repaired. Dark
edge on the solder. See?

14:55.372 --> 14:59.880
The only other place I've
ever seen that... is on this.

15:00.132 --> 15:02.132
(grunts)

15:04.572 --> 15:06.572
(groans)

15:07.372 --> 15:11.427
Your technique - you don't have any.

15:14.812 --> 15:16.812
(grunts)

15:18.172 --> 15:21.132
My leg - it still hurts.

15:21.972 --> 15:23.412
What's wrong with you?

15:23.452 --> 15:26.092
I'm better with a blade than
you, but I can only make them.

15:26.132 --> 15:28.172
You get to use one in battle.

15:28.212 --> 15:30.212
You're not better than me.

15:31.852 --> 15:34.092
Well, not yet.

15:34.132 --> 15:35.932
And I didn't ask to be born a Huskarla.

15:35.972 --> 15:37.892
But you were, and I wasn't.

15:37.932 --> 15:40.892
An ancestor of mine saved
some ancestor of Hrothgar's.

15:40.932 --> 15:42.812
You don't appreciate what you have.

15:42.852 --> 15:46.172
You don't want anything. What's
the point of even being you?

15:48.452 --> 15:50.332
I'm sorry.

15:50.372 --> 15:52.372
It's not you I'm angry at.

15:54.572 --> 15:57.452
Vishka... I do want things.

15:57.492 --> 15:59.492
Like what?

16:00.212 --> 16:02.692
Another chance to plant
your backside in the mud.

16:02.732 --> 16:05.692
Show a woman has no place holding a sword.

16:07.812 --> 16:09.812
A woman?

16:10.452 --> 16:13.681
Come on. And this time, think.

16:13.692 --> 16:15.692
Don't just hack and slash.

16:18.532 --> 16:20.532
(groans)

16:21.332 --> 16:22.652
(moans)

16:22.692 --> 16:25.412
- Is this Vishka's work?
- Yes, it's hers.

16:25.452 --> 16:28.412
But she's out, playing at being a Huskarla.

16:29.612 --> 16:31.932
As soon as she's back, I'll send her over.

16:33.252 --> 16:36.252
If it's Bayen's killer you're looking for,

16:36.292 --> 16:39.332
there was an argument at
the feast the other night.

16:39.372 --> 16:41.949
Him and a smelter, Tarn.

16:42.332 --> 16:44.332
That's all I know.

16:46.052 --> 16:48.052
That's helpful. (clears throat)

16:49.372 --> 16:52.452
You go on. Look into it.

16:52.492 --> 16:54.492
I'll catch up.

16:56.452 --> 16:58.452
Take a cold bath first.

16:59.372 --> 17:01.372
(chuckles)

17:03.812 --> 17:07.051
- (door closes)
- He likes to think he's funny.

17:07.092 --> 17:09.092
I thought that was you.

17:26.771 --> 17:31.052
If we work together, we've got a better
chance of finding the Skinshifter.

17:31.092 --> 17:33.572
This thing murdered Bayen.

17:35.292 --> 17:38.412
A man I had worked
alongside for seven years.

17:41.052 --> 17:43.252
Know a smelter called Tarn?

17:43.292 --> 17:45.292
He's their leader.

17:48.892 --> 17:50.892
- Are you going there alone?
- No.

17:51.652 --> 17:53.652
You're coming.

18:02.212 --> 18:04.972
Life's hard here. People come and go.

18:06.492 --> 18:08.972
Some scrape together
enough coin to buy a claim

18:09.012 --> 18:10.892
and move back to the mines.

18:10.932 --> 18:12.812
Others go back to the Farlands.

18:13.692 --> 18:17.237
Those that do stay
- they don't see old age.

18:20.892 --> 18:23.972
- I take it you're lost.
- We want to speak to Tarn.

18:24.012 --> 18:25.749
And I want to live up in that hall

18:25.774 --> 18:27.932
on the hill and drink wine whenever I like.

18:27.972 --> 18:31.492
Have some fine-boned Huskarla
sit on my lap as I sip it.

18:31.532 --> 18:34.652
A woman like you can do better
than those red-cloaked pretty boys.

18:34.692 --> 18:37.772
(chuckles) But I like them pretty.

18:37.812 --> 18:42.332
Beowulf right?
I'd say <i>you</i> were pretty. Once.

18:42.372 --> 18:44.932
(chuckles) If only we'd met then.

18:44.972 --> 18:47.012
(chuckles)

18:47.052 --> 18:49.052
Will you take us to Tarn?

18:51.772 --> 18:53.772
(troll growling)

19:03.452 --> 19:05.892
(growling)

19:05.932 --> 19:07.932
Tarn!

19:20.492 --> 19:23.012
Feed them meat. They get a taste.

19:23.052 --> 19:26.172
They get a taste... They can't get enough.

19:26.212 --> 19:27.772
What is it you want?

19:27.812 --> 19:30.532
The other night, you argued with Bayen.

19:30.572 --> 19:33.252
Did I? And how's that your business?

19:33.292 --> 19:36.292
You think, because you carved a
couple of fingers off a Mudborn,

19:36.332 --> 19:39.092
you can come down here
and accuse a man of murder?

19:39.812 --> 19:41.812
That is what you're doing?

19:42.972 --> 19:44.972
I'm just talking.

19:48.252 --> 19:50.252
(grunts)

19:51.652 --> 19:55.012
I haven't got time to watch you play
the big man before your ugly friends.

19:55.052 --> 19:57.052
On Beowulf.

19:57.332 --> 19:59.332
(grunts)

20:08.172 --> 20:10.172
(troll growling)

20:10.692 --> 20:12.212
Huh?

20:12.252 --> 20:14.252
On the smelter.

20:15.132 --> 20:17.132
(grunts)

20:20.252 --> 20:22.252
(growling)

20:24.492 --> 20:27.372
- Pull me in! (groans)
- The argument with Bayen!

20:27.412 --> 20:30.972
Coin! It was about coin. Talk
to Rheda's steward. Talk to Varr.

20:31.012 --> 20:32.982
- Why?
- I went to Bayen's place, and

20:33.007 --> 20:34.396
Varr was there already.

20:35.172 --> 20:37.172
(growling)

20:43.412 --> 20:45.996
Come on. Time is running out.

20:52.252 --> 20:55.132
BRECA: Pleasure doing
business with you, gentlemen.

20:55.172 --> 20:57.172
Get back to work!

20:58.812 --> 21:00.812
(troll growling)

21:05.172 --> 21:07.292
Lagrathorn of the Banning.

21:07.332 --> 21:09.023
He's been in love with you since you

21:09.048 --> 21:10.212
- were a girl...
- (CHUCKLES)

21:10.252 --> 21:12.412
and he visited Bregan.

21:12.452 --> 21:14.283
You were always jealous of the way

21:14.308 --> 21:16.556
I distracted the boys from your war games.

21:17.212 --> 21:20.092
- I admit it.
- And are you distracted now...

21:20.132 --> 21:22.372
by this lover of yours back in Bregan?

21:23.572 --> 21:25.572
An older sister knows everything.

21:26.292 --> 21:29.870
She must be doing something
for you. You smile more.

21:30.572 --> 21:33.171
Rheda. Abrecan.

21:35.292 --> 21:40.092
Lagrathorn. It's been too
long. How are the forests?

21:40.132 --> 21:44.092
Full of trees. You could have waited
for me by the fireside in Herot.

21:44.132 --> 21:48.634
My sister wanted to be sure she
could count on the Banning vote.

21:50.292 --> 21:52.292
Now, if you'd excuse me...

21:54.772 --> 21:56.772
Well?

21:58.012 --> 22:00.692
We've been raided this summer.

22:00.732 --> 22:04.372
Some of my people say Herot has
not done enough to protect us.

22:04.972 --> 22:08.292
And the price of your iron
always goes up and never down.

22:09.732 --> 22:13.090
Now that's out of the way,
what price for your vote?

22:14.412 --> 22:16.412
Everything that was your husband's.

22:16.452 --> 22:18.241
The fireplace in his hall to warm

22:18.266 --> 22:20.476
his feet against, and you to warm my bed.

22:21.892 --> 22:23.892
Riders!

22:31.252 --> 22:33.252
Rate of the Varni.

22:42.252 --> 22:44.252
Rheda...

22:44.852 --> 22:46.892
Making new friends?

22:46.932 --> 22:48.932
Learning more about some old ones.

22:50.252 --> 22:52.252
Shall we... ?

23:04.892 --> 23:06.892
Lagrathorn...

23:15.892 --> 23:18.249
Now, assuming you asked Rheda to marry you

23:18.274 --> 23:20.332
and she politely avoided answering...

23:20.372 --> 23:22.492
what can she really do for the Banning?

23:25.572 --> 23:29.191
So, where's Slean? Sulking
from not being made Thane?

23:31.092 --> 23:33.092
(creaking)

23:52.012 --> 23:54.012
Scorann?

23:54.652 --> 23:56.652
Scorann!

24:01.052 --> 24:03.452
Come on! The Thanes will be here soon.

24:03.492 --> 24:05.492
Varr...

24:06.932 --> 24:09.052
- What do you want?
- That can wait.

24:11.652 --> 24:15.839
The Thanes are already late.
There's still work to be done.

24:16.612 --> 24:18.612
It can wait.

24:22.532 --> 24:25.212
The alliance must be led by a warrior.

24:25.252 --> 24:27.092
Its purpose is war.

24:27.132 --> 24:30.492
It's purpose is to hold the peace.

24:30.532 --> 24:33.492
Something its leader must understand.

24:33.532 --> 24:36.003
I know it's difficult for you to back down

24:36.028 --> 24:38.532
now, having voiced your opinion so openly.

24:38.572 --> 24:41.012
What if I created a new post?

24:41.052 --> 24:43.412
Something suitable for a great warrior?

24:43.452 --> 24:47.052
Say... 'advisor on all matters military'.

24:47.092 --> 24:49.092
(chuckles)

24:51.132 --> 24:53.612
You think that's who I am?

24:53.652 --> 24:55.652
That I can be bought off with a title?

24:56.652 --> 24:59.492
Humans cannot live in
peace alongside the Mudborn,

24:59.532 --> 25:03.332
and if we try, we'll all suffer
the fate of the lost tribe.

25:03.892 --> 25:06.572
The Mere people were
slaughtered 20 summers ago,

25:06.612 --> 25:09.332
precisely because they
provoked the Mudborn...

25:09.372 --> 25:12.932
I'll see you don't get the
majority you need at the Gathering.

25:12.972 --> 25:15.532
Then I'll challenge you
to hand-to-hand combat.

25:15.572 --> 25:19.492
You'll step aside. I'll become
Jarl and lead the alliance.

25:19.532 --> 25:21.132
Huh!

25:21.172 --> 25:23.172
That is how it shall be.

25:24.412 --> 25:28.892
I would rather die by your blade
than step aside and let you be Jarl.

25:30.572 --> 25:33.612
Well, if you're dead...

25:33.652 --> 25:36.732
you won't be needing that
golden hall of yours, either.

25:39.732 --> 25:43.012
After you greeted the Varni
messenger, where did you go?

25:43.052 --> 25:45.012
Need to ask?

25:45.052 --> 25:46.972
This hall doesn't run itself.

25:47.012 --> 25:50.732
Tarn claims you were with
Bayen late on the night he died.

25:50.772 --> 25:54.452
I'm the steward of Rheda's
household. He was her Reeve.

25:54.492 --> 25:56.572
You want to know if I killed him?

25:56.612 --> 26:00.652
And the Varni messenger.
I'm your Skinshifter.

26:00.692 --> 26:02.292
You could have just asked.

26:02.332 --> 26:04.772
He'd lie.

26:04.812 --> 26:07.492
I'm not only outnumbered, but outwitted.

26:07.532 --> 26:09.532
Make him put his hand in there.

26:10.932 --> 26:12.492
In the fire.

26:12.532 --> 26:14.572
A Skinshifter can't be burnt.

26:15.492 --> 26:17.652
You didn't think to mention this before?

26:17.692 --> 26:19.692
It didn't seem relevant.

26:20.132 --> 26:22.532
Not directly.

26:22.572 --> 26:24.572
I heard the same thing.

26:29.172 --> 26:31.172
(groans)

26:35.132 --> 26:37.092
Varr...

26:37.132 --> 26:40.092
No need to apologise. It was my choice.

26:45.972 --> 26:49.852
What now? Burn everyone in
order to find this thing?

26:49.892 --> 26:52.212
If we have to.

26:52.252 --> 26:54.252
VISHKA: Beowulf...

27:02.492 --> 27:04.812
You wanted to know who I repaired this for.

27:06.852 --> 27:08.852
Elvina.

27:20.852 --> 27:22.852
(crow screeching)

27:44.123 --> 27:46.123
Scorann.

27:48.603 --> 27:50.123
(man shouting)

27:50.163 --> 27:52.283
Move! Now.

28:07.083 --> 28:09.083
Split up!

28:12.603 --> 28:14.603
(groans)

28:18.923 --> 28:20.883
MAN: Where are they?

28:20.923 --> 28:23.283
- Who are they?
- Brigands.

28:23.923 --> 28:28.323
Caught us on the North Road. Must be
after ransom. Are you alone?

28:33.123 --> 28:35.363
I'm sorry to hear about Hrothgar.

28:35.403 --> 28:38.363
Your father was... (chuckles)

28:39.123 --> 28:41.043
I'm not sorry at all.

28:41.083 --> 28:43.285
I've hated him ever since
he tricked me into

28:43.310 --> 28:45.683
taking that Wisdeth bride
to bind his alliance.

28:45.723 --> 28:47.883
I told him so to his face. A Varni,

28:47.908 --> 28:50.523
married to a big-boned farmer's daughter?

28:50.563 --> 28:53.883
I've been a walking, talking
dead man for 15 years.

28:53.923 --> 28:55.963
- What are you doing here?
- Do I need a reason

28:56.003 --> 28:58.843
to meet the only man who told
my father what he thought of him?

28:58.883 --> 29:01.523
- Yes, if it concerns your mother.
- She needs your vote.

29:01.563 --> 29:04.163
- (screaming)
- What is that?

29:04.203 --> 29:07.963
They must have taken my man alive.
He risked his life to save me.

29:08.003 --> 29:10.563
If it's ransom they want,
you're the prize, not him.

29:10.603 --> 29:13.043
They think you'll hand
yourself in to save him.

29:13.083 --> 29:15.083
I wouldn't want to disappoint them.

29:24.403 --> 29:26.403
(gasps)

29:27.683 --> 29:30.403
You should have come in,
made yourself at home.

29:36.443 --> 29:38.443
The clasp is mine.

29:39.443 --> 29:43.283
It was used to murder
Bayen and a Varni messenger.

29:44.363 --> 29:47.403
The killer was Mudborn. A Skinshifter.

29:50.563 --> 29:52.563
Who are your people?

29:53.323 --> 29:55.323
Wanderers.

29:57.283 --> 30:01.123
People of the Mere, the few that
escaped the slaughter in the Marshes.

30:02.683 --> 30:05.403
How did you come by a
Banning warrior's clasp?

30:05.443 --> 30:07.523
It was a gift to my father.

30:07.563 --> 30:09.563
I lost it at the feast.

30:10.083 --> 30:12.083
You can't think it's me.

30:14.563 --> 30:16.563
The Skinshifter can't be burnt.

30:17.643 --> 30:19.803
And it's wounded.

30:27.163 --> 30:29.163
Then I'll show you I have no wound.

30:45.163 --> 30:47.163
Enough.

31:25.763 --> 31:27.763
(footsteps)

31:31.603 --> 31:33.603
(thud)

31:41.683 --> 31:43.683
Show yourself!

31:45.563 --> 31:47.563
(snarling)

31:50.083 --> 31:52.083
(roaring)

31:52.723 --> 31:54.723
(groans)

31:57.243 --> 31:59.243
(roars)

32:04.843 --> 32:06.843
(roars in pain)

32:09.403 --> 32:11.403
(grunts)

32:11.963 --> 32:13.923
It's a Skinshifter!

32:13.963 --> 32:15.963
(screaming)

32:16.803 --> 32:18.803
There it is!

32:20.363 --> 32:22.363
(roars)

32:26.203 --> 32:28.243
(shouting)

32:28.283 --> 32:30.283
Move! Move!

32:30.763 --> 32:32.763
(gasps)

32:38.043 --> 32:40.083
Get away! Get away!

32:44.603 --> 32:47.083
- Move!
- Did you see it?

32:47.123 --> 32:49.123
MAN: Where's it gone?

33:30.283 --> 33:32.643
Tarn?

33:32.683 --> 33:34.443
Are you sure it's him?

33:34.483 --> 33:36.843
He has the wound I gave him. And another.

33:39.243 --> 33:41.243
That Bayen gave him.

33:45.923 --> 33:49.483
That's it? You found the
Skinshifter? Are you sure?

33:49.523 --> 33:52.243
- We have to get it out of here.
- Huh!

33:53.003 --> 33:54.583
Do you want to explain to the smelters

33:54.584 --> 33:57.107
that their leader is a Skinshifter?

34:05.163 --> 34:07.163
(horn blaring)

34:08.123 --> 34:10.123
- The Thanes.
- Come on!

34:10.842 --> 34:12.842
We need to hide the body.

34:16.643 --> 34:18.643
Quickly. They're coming.

34:28.362 --> 34:30.362
(grunts)

34:34.683 --> 34:37.483
- (panting)
- Shhh.

34:40.003 --> 34:42.003
I heard it breathe.

34:43.043 --> 34:45.483
It's air escaping the body.

34:49.322 --> 34:53.563
When I was a boy, my mother used
to tell stories about Skinshifters.

34:54.163 --> 34:57.963
Horrible, horrible stories.

34:59.683 --> 35:01.683
At least, I think she was my mother.

35:04.563 --> 35:06.563
I didn't know her well.

35:20.843 --> 35:22.843
Summon Beowulf.

35:26.083 --> 35:28.923
My son - has he returned?

35:29.483 --> 35:31.483
Not yet.

35:38.643 --> 35:40.643
(man screaming)

35:45.203 --> 35:47.203
Axel!

35:47.883 --> 35:51.963
Let my man go... and you can have me.

35:52.003 --> 35:55.123
We'll have you, anyway! Take him!

35:55.163 --> 35:57.163
(men shouting)

35:57.803 --> 35:59.803
(screaming)

36:00.923 --> 36:02.923
(groans)

36:06.203 --> 36:08.203
Wait!

36:13.243 --> 36:16.043
Catch him and cut him to pieces, boys!

36:19.323 --> 36:22.483
Leave that one. Don't you smell the coin?

36:31.683 --> 36:34.403
- Run!
- Do that and this one's dead!

36:44.352 --> 36:46.352
(sighs)

37:15.272 --> 37:17.272
(talking softly)

37:18.952 --> 37:21.619
His man's missing, and
if he doesn't know there's

37:21.644 --> 37:23.936
a Skinshifter on the loose, he will soon.

37:25.472 --> 37:28.792
- You found it?
- And killed it. Rheda...

37:28.832 --> 37:30.832
Rate...

37:30.872 --> 37:33.152
I'm sorry, but your shieldsman is dead.

37:33.792 --> 37:36.272
He laid down his life to save mine.

37:36.992 --> 37:38.752
Who killed him?

37:38.792 --> 37:42.792
Not who, but what. A Skinshifter.

37:42.832 --> 37:44.832
- Where is it?
- No!

37:45.872 --> 37:48.152
Rheda, let us be clear.

37:48.192 --> 37:51.032
You are telling us that the
most reviled of all our enemies

37:51.072 --> 37:53.992
is running loose in Herot?

37:54.032 --> 37:57.232
As soon as it was discovered,
I had it hunted down and killed.

37:58.232 --> 38:00.752
I favour peace...

38:00.792 --> 38:02.712
but if we have enemies,

38:02.752 --> 38:04.832
they will be struck down without mercy.

38:06.912 --> 38:08.912
Show us the body.

38:10.072 --> 38:12.072
Bring it.

38:15.592 --> 38:17.592
It's in human form.

38:18.152 --> 38:21.272
There's no way of proving
it's the Skinshifter.

38:21.312 --> 38:23.312
Well, find a way.

38:44.272 --> 38:47.272
- You murdered Tarn!
- He was a Skinshifter.

38:47.312 --> 38:50.232
Tarn was a man! I'm his mother.

38:52.112 --> 38:54.112
Koll...

38:56.112 --> 39:00.352
My son wasn't the best
of men, but he was a man.

39:15.432 --> 39:17.432
(grunts)

39:21.672 --> 39:24.352
- It's you! You killed them.
- I had no choice,

39:24.392 --> 39:26.392
but to protect my family.

39:30.672 --> 39:32.672
It's not Tarn!

39:36.632 --> 39:38.632
The doors!

39:40.712 --> 39:42.712
Close the doors!

39:46.592 --> 39:48.752
(roars)

39:48.792 --> 39:50.912
(clattering)

39:50.952 --> 39:52.952
See what that is.

39:54.872 --> 39:56.872
Let us all see.

39:58.792 --> 40:00.792
(growling)

40:03.792 --> 40:05.792
(roars)

40:08.872 --> 40:10.872
(groans)

40:13.672 --> 40:15.672
(roars)

40:18.152 --> 40:20.152
(panting)

40:33.432 --> 40:35.432
Koll.

40:37.112 --> 40:39.432
(pulls out sword)

40:39.472 --> 40:42.912
- Stand aside.
- That thing killed Argat's brother.

40:42.952 --> 40:44.952
And Herot's Reeve!

40:46.192 --> 40:48.678
When the time comes,
we'll toss a coin for the

40:48.703 --> 40:51.136
pleasure of cutting
its throat, but not yet.

40:54.112 --> 40:56.952
I believe the Skinshifter was
acting on someone else's part.

40:56.992 --> 41:00.032
Kill it, and we may never know who.

41:00.072 --> 41:02.072
What makes you say that?

41:03.072 --> 41:04.992
It said as much.

41:05.032 --> 41:07.752
And it used this to do its killing.

41:09.312 --> 41:11.432
Left it in the dead Varni, to be found.

41:11.472 --> 41:15.472
- A Banning clasp.
- This wasn't about Bayen or the Varni.

41:16.592 --> 41:20.032
It was about killing your Reeve
and stirring up the tribes.

41:21.072 --> 41:23.792
To make my sister look
weak before the Gathering.

41:24.432 --> 41:26.432
(grunts)

41:43.352 --> 41:47.352
It makes no sense. He was
a loving husband, father.

41:47.392 --> 41:50.072
He lived here in peace for
years. He was a good man.

41:50.112 --> 41:52.712
Man? This thing was a murderer of men.

41:52.752 --> 41:55.392
Amongst them, Bayen,
who it called a friend.

41:55.432 --> 41:58.912
All Mudborn are killers.
It's in their blood.

41:58.952 --> 42:00.952
And what's in yours?

42:10.672 --> 42:15.352
Mmm. My wife... can cook. Try.

42:17.272 --> 42:20.472
Hey... we did a good job today.

42:20.512 --> 42:22.632
We?

42:22.672 --> 42:25.032
I was there, too.

42:25.072 --> 42:27.072
Hey...

42:27.552 --> 42:29.552
Get your own wife.

42:30.712 --> 42:32.712
(gasps)

42:38.032 --> 42:40.032
(horse neighing)

42:42.872 --> 42:45.112
Whoa. Easy.

42:45.152 --> 42:47.392
(neighing)

42:47.432 --> 42:49.472
Easy. Easy. Shhh.

42:50.232 --> 42:52.232
Easy, boy.

42:56.592 --> 42:58.592
That's Slean's horse.

43:02.312 --> 43:04.312
My son.

43:08.472 --> 43:10.192
They will find Slean.

43:10.232 --> 43:13.832
Rate and Beowulf are looking for
him now. There are no finer warriors.

43:14.992 --> 43:18.192
- What is he?
- A filthy Mudborn!

43:18.232 --> 43:21.272
If Scorann doesn't arrive,
your future is in my hands.

43:21.312 --> 43:23.312
- People don't want justice.
- (roars)

43:23.352 --> 43:24.912
They want to see strength.

43:24.952 --> 43:27.487
I was born a warrior, and I'll die one.
