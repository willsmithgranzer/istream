1
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:05,240
because they can live
amongst us undetected.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,520
- Can you find it and kill it?
- If it's still here.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,760
Rate wishes to see himself made Jarl
of the Shieldlands instead of you.

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,320
I'll see you don't get the
majority you need at the Gathering.

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,560
It's you! You killed them.

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,480
To protect my family.

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,699
I believe the Skinshifter was
acting on someone else's part.

8
00:00:28,724 --> 00:00:30,480
It was about stirring up the tribes.

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,400
Uh! Uhh...

10
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,920
My son, has he returned?

11
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,440
That's Slean's horse!

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,074

13
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,640
Hey! Get away from there!

14
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,360
Oi!

15
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,880
I hear there will soon
be a new widow in town.

16
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,200
Ah!

Uhh.

19
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,680
It's me you want. Let him go.

20
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,400
Can we kill him now?

21
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,600
Someone will pay to have
him back. In one piece!

22
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,760
Look at the sword.

23
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
- What do you say?
- I say he's barelyable to grow a beard.

24
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,040
And this?

25
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,920
This is a man's blade.

26
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,760
Beowulf.

27
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,360
Feel the weight.

28
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,880
'Twas a gift from my father.

29
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,000
Uhh!

30
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,840
Get up!

31
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,920
Move your arses!

32
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,720
If we don't get Scorann to
Ramin's Tomb, we don't get paid.

33
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,480
Where I come from, we have
a name for scum like you.

34
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,920
Move!

35
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,280
When Slean's horse passed
this way, it still had a rider.

36
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,960
My brother?

37
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,520
If Slean met Scorann, it wasn't here.

38
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,120
These lands aren't as
safe as they once were.

39
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,520
There was a Mudborn,
out by the Silver Lake.

40
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,280
A strange thing.

41
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,320
With a severed hand?

42
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,920
We met.

43
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,360
If you're scared, you can wait here.

44
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,320
And leave the fate of The
Shieldlands in your hands?

45
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,920
I'm here for Slean.

46
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,320
Did the Skinshifter
regain consciousness yet?

47
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,160
As soon as Koll can be
questioned, I'll be informed.

48
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,400
Until such time, his wife is
our only means of finding out

49
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,040
who ordered the creature
to murder my Reeve.

50
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,640
I'll have her brought to you.

51
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,080
Why aren't you out searching
for Scorann and my son?

52
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,800
I ordered the Huskarla
be stationed around Herot.

53
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,280
It must be seen to be protected.

54
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,600
Your people are scared and angry.

55
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,640
They don't understand why you've
chosen to keep the Skinshifter alive.

56
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,160
Tomorrow morning, the other
Thanes will vote at the Gathering.

57
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,720
Without Scorann, I will not have
enough support to become Jarl.

58
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,900
Scorann will be found. His brother Rate and

59
00:06:06,925 --> 00:06:09,040
Beowulf are out there looking for him now.

60
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,800
There are no finer
warriors in The Shieldlands.

61
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,609
They will find Slean, I am certain.

62
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,160
Admit it, you've lost the trail.

63
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,320
I heard you could handle
yourself in a fight.

64
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,600
- Could?
- Mm.

65
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,880
All those years in the Farlands
might have left you a little... soft.

66
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,480
I can still handle myself.

67
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,920
You look a little soft yourself.

68
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,160
A man becomes Thane all he
has to do is talk a good fight.

69
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,240
It's at least a week old.

70
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,560
A Warig?

71
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,400
Come on!

72
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,840
Faster!

73
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,920
Urgh!

74
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,200
Drop it.

75
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,120
Drop it before you hurt yourself.

76
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,680
Give the man his sword.

77
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,960
Urgh! Uhh!

78
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,760
No.

79
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,080
Watch me talk it to death.

80
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,040
- Come on.
- Yaah!

81
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,600
Ahhh!

82
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,480
Uhhh!

83
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,700
In my tribe, if a man
loses his sword to an enemy,

84
00:08:03,725 --> 00:08:06,480
he's no longer fit to be a warrior.

85
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,120
Really?

86
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,840
We let him walk into the
mountains and die alone.

87
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,560
And what if he loses his
sword to some half-grown Warig?

88
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,400
Ah, then we usually just get it back.

89
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,440
And let him die of shame.

90
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,440
Scorann's men.

91
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,320
- Leave him for me.
- No. Another day.

92
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Slean's not here.

93
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,760
Come. We have no time to lose.

94
00:09:14,123 --> 00:09:16,123
There! She's coming!

95
00:09:17,403 --> 00:09:19,683
- There she is!
- She's here!

96
00:09:23,803 --> 00:09:25,643
The Skinshifter's wife!

97
00:09:29,243 --> 00:09:31,243
Kill! Kill her!

98
00:09:36,123 --> 00:09:39,003
They should stop this
before it gets out of control.

99
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:45,283
Where are you taking her?

100
00:09:45,323 --> 00:09:49,043
That thing they're keeping in
there, that she calls a husband,

101
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,083
butchered my son!

102
00:09:52,363 --> 00:09:55,243
I am sorry for what happened to your son.

103
00:09:55,283 --> 00:09:57,923
But what Koll did he was forced to do.

104
00:09:57,963 --> 00:09:59,763
He's a good man.

105
00:09:59,803 --> 00:10:01,283
Urghh!

106
00:10:03,483 --> 00:10:04,803
Ma! Ma!

107
00:10:04,843 --> 00:10:06,203
No!

108
00:10:06,243 --> 00:10:07,803
- No!
- Aah!

109
00:10:07,843 --> 00:10:09,563
This isn't right.

110
00:10:09,603 --> 00:10:14,283
The punishment for consorting
with a Skinshifter is death!

111
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:15,963
Ma!

112
00:10:16,003 --> 00:10:17,963
Only if she knew.

113
00:10:18,003 --> 00:10:20,203
She knew! Didn't you?

114
00:10:22,283 --> 00:10:24,283
You knew!

115
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:26,363
Deny it.

116
00:10:27,443 --> 00:10:29,163
I deny it.

117
00:10:29,203 --> 00:10:31,203
I never knew.

118
00:10:31,243 --> 00:10:33,523
Say it. What is he?

119
00:10:35,283 --> 00:10:37,283
A filthy Mudborn.

120
00:10:38,483 --> 00:10:40,083
Louder!

121
00:10:40,123 --> 00:10:42,923
A filthy Mudborn!

122
00:10:44,363 --> 00:10:46,163
A killer!

123
00:10:46,203 --> 00:10:48,803
Who deceived me and my daughter!

124
00:10:52,043 --> 00:10:54,243
Stand aside! Move!

125
00:10:57,403 --> 00:10:59,403
What do you think you're doing?

126
00:10:59,443 --> 00:11:01,043
My orders...

127
00:11:02,043 --> 00:11:05,443
... were for you to bring
this woman safely to me.

128
00:11:06,843 --> 00:11:09,963
Not stand aside and watch
as she is torn apart!

129
00:11:12,523 --> 00:11:14,243
No!

130
00:11:14,283 --> 00:11:18,163
I claim this woman's life
for the life of my son.

131
00:11:20,443 --> 00:11:23,323
Rheda, I would willingly give her my life.

132
00:11:23,363 --> 00:11:25,883
It means nothing to me any more.

133
00:11:28,043 --> 00:11:30,043
But I still have a daughter.

134
00:11:31,243 --> 00:11:34,363
It still has value to her. Please?

135
00:11:38,563 --> 00:11:40,563
Your people want her dead.

136
00:11:43,123 --> 00:11:45,123
But I need her alive.

137
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:48,163
Or I'll never know who the
Skinshifter was acting for.

138
00:11:51,883 --> 00:11:54,283
This woman has a right to make her case.

139
00:11:54,323 --> 00:11:56,323
At trial.

140
00:12:00,603 --> 00:12:02,603
Have her brought to my chambers.

141
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,323
What?

142
00:12:33,843 --> 00:12:35,153
In my tribe, she would have been cut

143
00:12:35,317 --> 00:12:38,243
down the moment that thing was revealed.

144
00:12:38,283 --> 00:12:40,403
Different tribes, different laws.

145
00:12:42,323 --> 00:12:45,003
Your loyalty to your
sister is quite touching.

146
00:12:45,043 --> 00:12:47,043
But, if you were back in Bregan,

147
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,683
would you, as its Thane,
countenance a trial,

148
00:12:49,723 --> 00:12:53,323
for someone who slept between
the same sheets as a Skinshifter?

149
00:12:55,123 --> 00:12:56,723
No.

150
00:12:56,763 --> 00:12:58,963
But we're not in Bregan. Are we?

151
00:13:01,123 --> 00:13:02,523
Hey.

152
00:13:05,123 --> 00:13:09,443
If Scorann isn't here for the vote,
your sister might be in trouble.

153
00:13:12,443 --> 00:13:14,443
Don't underestimate her.

154
00:13:17,883 --> 00:13:20,683
A little early in the day
for that, don't you think?

155
00:13:24,123 --> 00:13:26,189
As Thane, I can show you mercy, but, if

156
00:13:26,214 --> 00:13:28,203
I'm to do that, you must help me now.

157
00:13:28,243 --> 00:13:30,243
I knew nothing of what Koll was.

158
00:13:30,283 --> 00:13:32,283
- Who did he act for?
- I don't know.

159
00:13:32,323 --> 00:13:33,341
- Sylvi...
- I swear it!

160
00:13:33,366 --> 00:13:35,027
I think she speaks the truth.

161
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:39,963
If you don't help me...

162
00:13:40,003 --> 00:13:44,243
Rheda, when others doubted
your becoming Thane,

163
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:46,283
I spoke out for you.

164
00:13:46,323 --> 00:13:48,323
I would never lie.

165
00:13:48,363 --> 00:13:50,283
Not to you.

166
00:14:17,043 --> 00:14:20,243
This isn't about a ransom.
They're being paid to take me.

167
00:14:34,603 --> 00:14:36,603
Isen!

168
00:14:40,043 --> 00:14:41,643
Move!

169
00:14:49,523 --> 00:14:51,523
The embers are warm.

170
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:07,363
You think they have Slean, too?

171
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:11,777
It doesn't strike you
as convenient that your

172
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:14,947
brother vanishes on the
eve of the Gathering?

173
00:15:16,443 --> 00:15:18,443
Convenient for who?

174
00:15:20,203 --> 00:15:22,603
For anyone who wants
Rheda to lose the vote.

175
00:15:23,683 --> 00:15:26,363
You assume Scorann would
cast his vote for her.

176
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:30,963
But he has the sense to see the
Shieldlands need a strong leader.

177
00:15:32,643 --> 00:15:34,643
And that would be you?

178
00:15:36,563 --> 00:15:38,563
At what price?

179
00:15:38,603 --> 00:15:40,603
For the good of all?

180
00:15:40,643 --> 00:15:42,843
Whatever price need be paid.

181
00:15:44,163 --> 00:15:46,163
The life of a brother?

182
00:15:54,443 --> 00:15:56,443
Aaah! Urgh!

183
00:15:56,483 --> 00:15:58,163
Uhh.

184
00:16:00,563 --> 00:16:02,163
Get up!

185
00:16:02,203 --> 00:16:03,963
My ankle.

186
00:16:05,483 --> 00:16:07,003
Now!

187
00:16:08,483 --> 00:16:09,963
Urgh.

188
00:16:12,643 --> 00:16:14,203
Move!

189
00:16:22,123 --> 00:16:24,123
Don't let them get away!

190
00:16:26,003 --> 00:16:29,041
They're getting away! Move it! Come on!

191
00:16:31,883 --> 00:16:33,203
Jump!

192
00:16:36,723 --> 00:16:38,097
You could have told me you were

193
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,603
- going to do that!
- I didn't know.

194
00:16:39,643 --> 00:16:41,323
You're enjoying this.

195
00:16:43,203 --> 00:16:44,843
Sssh-sssh-sssh!

196
00:16:46,603 --> 00:16:48,603
Spread out!

197
00:16:50,003 --> 00:16:52,003
Come on, move on!

198
00:17:00,283 --> 00:17:01,883
Aaah!

199
00:17:07,123 --> 00:17:08,723
Hold him!

200
00:17:09,723 --> 00:17:11,723
Aaah...

201
00:17:26,323 --> 00:17:27,923
Let's go.

202
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:39,323
The ankle, how is it?

203
00:17:41,323 --> 00:17:43,323
I didn't know you cared.

204
00:17:44,443 --> 00:17:46,243
- Aaah!
- Scorann!

205
00:17:46,283 --> 00:17:48,283
Uhh... Uhh...

206
00:17:55,123 --> 00:17:59,923
Your new Thane gives a Skinshifter
a bed and its wife a trial!

207
00:18:01,483 --> 00:18:05,563
Next, she'll have Mudborn at
your tables, drinking your mead!

208
00:18:07,843 --> 00:18:09,843
Perhaps Hrothgar made a mistake

209
00:18:09,883 --> 00:18:14,043
in over-looking his son and
appointing his wife as Thane!

210
00:18:17,123 --> 00:18:21,043
The laws of Herot were laid
down under my husband's rule,

211
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,203
but they will be followed under mine.

212
00:18:23,243 --> 00:18:26,723
Though you have to wonder
whose hand were they written in.

213
00:18:26,763 --> 00:18:29,523
We're not here to discuss
my husband, but hers.

214
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:34,603
And, despite your rank, I
would ask you remember that.

215
00:18:45,843 --> 00:18:50,323
If I judge you guilty,
your life is the smelter's.

216
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:52,363
That is the law.

217
00:19:00,403 --> 00:19:02,403
Did you know what your husband was?

218
00:19:02,443 --> 00:19:04,763
No.

219
00:19:06,843 --> 00:19:10,123
Eight summers ago, I
had a child with a man.

220
00:19:10,163 --> 00:19:11,763
He...

221
00:19:11,803 --> 00:19:14,003
He used to beat us.

222
00:19:14,043 --> 00:19:16,123
Koll saved us.

223
00:19:17,403 --> 00:19:19,763
He took my daughter as his own.

224
00:19:21,763 --> 00:19:23,963
We came back to my home, here, to Herot,

225
00:19:24,003 --> 00:19:26,003
but I never knew what he was.

226
00:19:26,043 --> 00:19:28,043
I never did!

227
00:19:29,723 --> 00:19:32,923
I believed in the good man I saw.

228
00:19:34,003 --> 00:19:36,203
Not the creature that was hidden.

229
00:19:37,483 --> 00:19:41,255
How is it possible to lie with a man every

230
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,763
night for years and not know who he is?

231
00:19:44,803 --> 00:19:50,803
I lay with my son's father one night
and I knew he was a good-for-nothing!

232
00:19:54,763 --> 00:19:56,563
May I speak on Sylvi's part?

233
00:19:59,643 --> 00:20:01,363
Quiet!

234
00:20:01,403 --> 00:20:03,683
Let her speak.

235
00:20:07,603 --> 00:20:09,603
Sixtan, you baked Koll's bread.

236
00:20:10,923 --> 00:20:14,203
And you... You brought
him food in this hall.

237
00:20:15,563 --> 00:20:17,763
You took his money when he lost at dice.

238
00:20:18,923 --> 00:20:20,923
We all made him welcome.

239
00:20:20,963 --> 00:20:22,963
None of us knew.

240
00:20:24,763 --> 00:20:29,083
This man was appointed by Hrothgar
to help Bayen keep the law.

241
00:20:29,123 --> 00:20:31,123
If he was fooled,

242
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:34,003
then what chance that this humble,

243
00:20:34,043 --> 00:20:37,243
untutored woman would know any different?

244
00:20:40,123 --> 00:20:44,443
Would you really have Rheda
make this child an orphan

245
00:20:44,483 --> 00:20:47,083
for a mistake of which we're all guilty?

246
00:20:49,443 --> 00:20:51,723
We are on trial here.

247
00:20:51,763 --> 00:20:53,763
As much as her mother.

248
00:20:57,283 --> 00:20:59,483
Make your judgment and be done.

249
00:20:59,523 --> 00:21:01,523
Yes!

250
00:21:06,203 --> 00:21:08,203
Make a decision!

251
00:21:13,723 --> 00:21:15,923
Have the child brought to my chambers.

252
00:21:17,683 --> 00:21:19,283
Where is she going?

253
00:21:19,323 --> 00:21:23,643
Wait. Rheda wishes to
take counsel with me first.

254
00:21:26,843 --> 00:21:28,843
Give your judgement now!

255
00:21:28,883 --> 00:21:31,443
You find the woman innocent?

256
00:21:33,283 --> 00:21:35,283
Elvina spoke well.

257
00:21:35,323 --> 00:21:37,202
Lucky, because I don't think you'd

258
00:21:37,227 --> 00:21:39,427
have had it in you to have her executed.

259
00:21:40,963 --> 00:21:42,963
The law must be upheld.

260
00:21:43,003 --> 00:21:45,003
Yeah.

261
00:21:45,043 --> 00:21:47,043
Pretty words.

262
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,083
Pretty mouth.

263
00:21:50,763 --> 00:21:52,763
You're drunk.

264
00:21:54,363 --> 00:21:56,363
If Scorann doesn't arrive...

265
00:21:57,443 --> 00:21:59,443
... your future will be in my hands.

266
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:07,043
We're old friends.

267
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:09,283
How can I help you make up your mind?

268
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,123
Hrothgar was a great warrior.

269
00:22:17,563 --> 00:22:21,883
But... could he have led, as well,
without your words in his ear?

270
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,923
Then you know I can lead.

271
00:22:23,963 --> 00:22:25,963
I know you can counsel a leader.

272
00:22:27,883 --> 00:22:30,883
But this trial shows you are naive.

273
00:22:33,123 --> 00:22:35,123
Your people don't want justice.

274
00:22:36,723 --> 00:22:38,723
They want to see strength.

275
00:22:40,563 --> 00:22:42,683
- And they want blood.
- I know my people.

276
00:22:44,123 --> 00:22:46,123
I should get back to them now.

277
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:50,283
I could lead.

278
00:22:50,323 --> 00:22:52,323
And you could counsel.

279
00:22:54,523 --> 00:22:56,523
As my wife.

280
00:22:57,603 --> 00:22:59,603
Your bed must be cold.

281
00:23:05,123 --> 00:23:07,443
Hrothgar was my husband.

282
00:23:07,483 --> 00:23:09,483
I'll not take another.

283
00:23:15,803 --> 00:23:18,603
- I'd be a good husband to you.
- You should leave now.

284
00:23:19,683 --> 00:23:22,483
You will take me, because you need me.

285
00:23:22,523 --> 00:23:24,443
And because I... I've...

286
00:23:24,483 --> 00:23:26,963
always, always... wanted you.

287
00:23:33,923 --> 00:23:35,923
Unless you want to leave here...

288
00:23:37,123 --> 00:23:39,123
... carrying your guts,

289
00:23:39,163 --> 00:23:41,163
step away.

290
00:23:44,683 --> 00:23:46,683
Then you will lose all this.

291
00:23:48,403 --> 00:23:50,603
- My Thane?
- I told you to wait!

292
00:23:55,123 --> 00:23:56,723
My mistake.

293
00:23:59,603 --> 00:24:01,163
Get out.

294
00:24:32,123 --> 00:24:34,123
Thank you.

295
00:24:39,803 --> 00:24:41,803
Erm... The girl.

296
00:24:44,603 --> 00:24:46,603
When you're ready.

297
00:24:59,854 --> 00:25:01,854
You served a Thane like me?

298
00:25:01,894 --> 00:25:05,294
There are no Thanes in the lands
I come from, only an Emperor.

299
00:25:08,254 --> 00:25:10,654
- You were in his guard?
- I was its master.

300
00:25:11,854 --> 00:25:13,454
Uhh.

301
00:25:18,614 --> 00:25:21,574
The Outcasts, where are they headed?

302
00:25:21,614 --> 00:25:23,614
Speak and I'll finish you cleanly.

303
00:25:23,654 --> 00:25:26,454
Hold your tongue and we'll
leave you for the trolls.

304
00:25:26,494 --> 00:25:28,544
They'll have finished with
those Wisdeth guards by now.

305
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:30,518
Be along for you soon.

306
00:25:31,654 --> 00:25:33,654
Ramin's Tomb.

307
00:25:34,974 --> 00:25:37,574
We're to hold Scorann
there, until tomorrow.

308
00:25:37,614 --> 00:25:39,614
After the Gathering.

309
00:25:39,654 --> 00:25:41,654
Who are you working for?

310
00:25:42,934 --> 00:25:47,934
A man named Vlade will come and
pay us. That's all we were told.

311
00:25:51,694 --> 00:25:53,294
Torr!

312
00:25:56,174 --> 00:25:57,974
Where is he?

313
00:25:58,014 --> 00:26:00,814
You want to go back and
look for him? Do it yourself.

314
00:26:05,734 --> 00:26:07,734
One less share to worry about.

315
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:10,534
Move!

316
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:13,254
Aah.

317
00:26:18,254 --> 00:26:20,254
What's wrong?

318
00:26:23,654 --> 00:26:25,654
Nothing.

319
00:26:34,974 --> 00:26:37,094
I know you're scared. It's all right.

320
00:26:42,174 --> 00:26:44,454
I think we're all a bit scared right now.

321
00:26:51,734 --> 00:26:53,814
I need you to help me with something.

322
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:58,414
You know your da is in trouble.

323
00:27:00,054 --> 00:27:02,254
You'd like this to stop, wouldn't you?

324
00:27:08,654 --> 00:27:10,654
Well, it won't.

325
00:27:11,974 --> 00:27:13,974
Even if I let your da go...

326
00:27:15,494 --> 00:27:17,494
... people will see him

327
00:27:17,534 --> 00:27:20,534
and they'll say, "That's
the man from Herot."

328
00:27:21,534 --> 00:27:23,534
And you'll never be safe.

329
00:27:24,534 --> 00:27:26,734
They'll see his face

330
00:27:26,774 --> 00:27:28,774
and they'll know.

331
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:32,214
- And they'll come after you.
- But he could change! He could...

332
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,654
Change into a Skinshifter.

333
00:27:40,334 --> 00:27:42,334
It was a secret, wasn't it?

334
00:27:47,054 --> 00:27:49,054
Your ma said never tell.

335
00:27:49,094 --> 00:27:51,094
People wouldn't understand.

336
00:27:52,054 --> 00:27:54,054
But I do understand.

337
00:28:21,454 --> 00:28:24,454
What is this? Do you
want to get paid or not?

338
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,494
- Move it!
- Hurry up!

339
00:28:27,494 --> 00:28:29,494
Move yourselves!

340
00:28:48,534 --> 00:28:51,934
Your brother and Slean could
get killed in the confusion.

341
00:28:51,974 --> 00:28:54,174
Unless that's what you to happen?

342
00:28:55,374 --> 00:28:59,174
If that's what I wanted, he'd
see my face before he died.

343
00:29:05,654 --> 00:29:07,454
The jewellery.

344
00:29:07,494 --> 00:29:09,294
Give it to me.

345
00:29:09,334 --> 00:29:11,334
It's not jewellery.

346
00:29:13,614 --> 00:29:15,414
Why?

347
00:29:15,454 --> 00:29:16,894
Uhh.

348
00:29:18,454 --> 00:29:20,454
Clean up your leg.

349
00:29:22,014 --> 00:29:24,214
Who is it that wants to make some money?

350
00:29:27,254 --> 00:29:29,054
Uhh.

351
00:29:29,094 --> 00:29:30,574
Axel!

352
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,854
Oh-ho, yeah!

353
00:29:41,334 --> 00:29:42,894
Come on!

354
00:29:50,134 --> 00:29:52,094
That's Hrothgar's blade, isn't it?

355
00:29:52,654 --> 00:29:54,654
He gave it to you?

356
00:29:59,534 --> 00:30:01,614
I had to take it out of his dead hands.

357
00:30:01,654 --> 00:30:05,894
He may have made Rheda Thane, but
who else could he give that to?

358
00:30:05,934 --> 00:30:07,934
Beowulf.

359
00:30:13,454 --> 00:30:15,454
He's back.

360
00:30:15,494 --> 00:30:19,094
I heard that, even as a boy,
he had a way with killing.

361
00:30:20,974 --> 00:30:22,774
There's none better.

362
00:30:23,774 --> 00:30:25,254
Urghh!

363
00:30:34,534 --> 00:30:36,534
You have Scorann?

364
00:30:39,494 --> 00:30:41,574
Who are you?

365
00:30:41,614 --> 00:30:43,214
Vlade?

366
00:30:48,214 --> 00:30:50,848
- Where's the coin?
- You'll get it.

367
00:31:03,054 --> 00:31:05,334
- How did this happen?
- An accident.

368
00:31:15,774 --> 00:31:17,534
Let's talk price.

369
00:31:17,574 --> 00:31:19,574
It was agreed.

370
00:31:22,294 --> 00:31:24,294
Beowulf?

371
00:31:37,054 --> 00:31:39,054
We agreed coin.

372
00:31:41,454 --> 00:31:43,454
You, fetch Axel.

373
00:31:43,494 --> 00:31:46,294
What are you waiting for?
Tell him Vlade is here.

374
00:31:46,334 --> 00:31:47,934
Axel!

375
00:31:48,894 --> 00:31:50,494
Axel!

376
00:32:17,254 --> 00:32:19,054
- Uhh!
- Come on!

377
00:32:19,094 --> 00:32:21,094
I'll catch my breath.

378
00:32:22,334 --> 00:32:25,054
Go ahead, find that precious sword.

379
00:32:40,214 --> 00:32:42,214
Uh. Aah.

380
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:58,487
Why?

381
00:32:59,654 --> 00:33:02,054
My sons will be farmers.

382
00:33:02,094 --> 00:33:05,334
And they will breed with farmers.

383
00:33:05,374 --> 00:33:07,654
And they will rule farmers.

384
00:33:08,814 --> 00:33:10,273
And they will be happy with that,

385
00:33:10,274 --> 00:33:13,158
because that is all
they have ever known.

386
00:33:15,414 --> 00:33:17,414
But I was born a warrior

387
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:19,454
and I'll die one.

388
00:33:55,214 --> 00:33:57,054
- Yaaa-aah!
- Ah!

389
00:33:57,094 --> 00:33:58,574
Aaah...

390
00:34:03,094 --> 00:34:04,654
Uhh.

391
00:34:06,494 --> 00:34:08,494
- Vlade?
- Dead.

392
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:12,534
- My brother?
- In the tombs.

393
00:34:41,014 --> 00:34:43,014
Rate...

394
00:34:50,813 --> 00:34:55,310
Beowulf, few men live
up to their reputation.

395
00:34:55,813 --> 00:34:57,614
You are one of them.

396
00:34:57,654 --> 00:34:59,654
There's no time for this.

397
00:34:59,694 --> 00:35:01,774
Still jealous of my praise, brother?

398
00:35:01,814 --> 00:35:04,854
You don't have long.
Scorann, give me your vote.

399
00:35:05,934 --> 00:35:07,934
Your concern is touching.

400
00:35:07,974 --> 00:35:09,974
Speak the words.

401
00:35:12,614 --> 00:35:14,614
These are my words.

402
00:35:16,694 --> 00:35:19,174
Rheda shall keep peace in the Shieldlands.

403
00:35:20,254 --> 00:35:23,716
- You hunger for war.
- We're blood.

404
00:35:26,054 --> 00:35:28,054
I am a Varni

405
00:35:28,094 --> 00:35:30,094
and you are my brother.

406
00:35:32,374 --> 00:35:34,374
But I was Thane of the Wisdeth.

407
00:35:35,454 --> 00:35:37,454
And Rheda will protect them.

408
00:35:38,534 --> 00:35:41,804
- My vote goes to her.
- You can't do this.

409
00:35:43,334 --> 00:35:45,334
There's a condition.

410
00:36:05,094 --> 00:36:06,694
No.

411
00:36:06,734 --> 00:36:08,734
Let him rest.

412
00:36:11,254 --> 00:36:13,254
This was his place of glory.

413
00:36:34,654 --> 00:36:36,195
- Scorann?
- He's dead.

414
00:36:36,196 --> 00:36:38,134
How? When I left him, he was...

415
00:36:38,174 --> 00:36:41,174
It wasn't your fault. He
chose the time and the place.

416
00:36:47,054 --> 00:36:49,254
Then you came for nothing.

417
00:36:49,294 --> 00:36:51,294
No.

418
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,334
I came for you.

419
00:37:25,845 --> 00:37:28,125
You said you didn't know his true nature.

420
00:37:28,165 --> 00:37:30,405
But that was a lie.

421
00:37:30,445 --> 00:37:32,925
You knew what you married.

422
00:37:32,965 --> 00:37:34,525
No. I...

423
00:37:34,565 --> 00:37:36,805
Your daughter told me.

424
00:37:36,845 --> 00:37:38,845
There we are!

425
00:37:46,565 --> 00:37:48,565
I loved him.

426
00:37:48,605 --> 00:37:50,885
I knew what he was.

427
00:37:50,925 --> 00:37:53,405
And I didn't care. Is that so wrong?

428
00:37:58,485 --> 00:38:00,765
The sentence is death.

429
00:38:02,845 --> 00:38:05,845
To be carried out immediately
by the smelter's hand.

430
00:38:10,966 --> 00:38:14,165
- I underestimated you.
- It's the law.

431
00:38:17,485 --> 00:38:19,085
Quiet!

432
00:38:19,125 --> 00:38:20,725
Sylvi.

433
00:38:22,725 --> 00:38:24,725
I can't help you now.

434
00:38:24,765 --> 00:38:27,805
But if you tell me who made
Koll do the things he did,

435
00:38:27,845 --> 00:38:31,165
then I will make sure your
child is well looked after.

436
00:38:31,205 --> 00:38:33,205
He didn't tell me.

437
00:38:33,245 --> 00:38:36,245
All he ever wanted was to protect us.

438
00:38:38,845 --> 00:38:40,645
No.

439
00:38:42,725 --> 00:38:45,525
And you call the Mudborn beasts!

440
00:38:47,685 --> 00:38:50,485
No, Ma! No, no! No, Ma!

441
00:38:57,845 --> 00:38:59,845
Wake up.

442
00:39:01,325 --> 00:39:03,325
Wake up!

443
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,925
Not so scary in your cage now.

444
00:39:07,209 --> 00:39:10,005
Give us a show.

445
00:39:11,685 --> 00:39:13,685
What do you think I am? A freak?

446
00:39:13,725 --> 00:39:15,525
What else?

447
00:39:15,565 --> 00:39:19,725
When your ancestors were living
in caves in the Farlands...

448
00:39:21,085 --> 00:39:23,485
... my bloodline were priests

449
00:39:23,525 --> 00:39:27,125
to the giant-kings that ruled here.

450
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:28,925
Hm...

451
00:39:31,125 --> 00:39:34,445
We walked this black earth like princes!

452
00:39:37,085 --> 00:39:39,485
Rheda just sentenced your wife...

453
00:39:40,565 --> 00:39:42,565
... to death.

454
00:39:43,845 --> 00:39:45,845
Make you mad?

455
00:40:25,845 --> 00:40:27,845
Run!

456
00:40:37,605 --> 00:40:39,205
Go!

457
00:40:39,245 --> 00:40:41,245
Leave! Don't look back.

458
00:40:45,325 --> 00:40:47,325
Uhh!

459
00:40:52,805 --> 00:40:54,805
Come. Come.

460
00:40:55,885 --> 00:40:57,885
Get her inside. Get her inside.

461
00:40:58,965 --> 00:41:00,965
Where's his wife?

462
00:41:45,565 --> 00:41:49,165
I called off the search
for Sylvi and the child.

463
00:41:51,565 --> 00:41:53,565
The Gathering is in the morning.

464
00:42:02,565 --> 00:42:05,365
- My son?
- Lives.

465
00:42:05,405 --> 00:42:07,285
And Scorann?

466
00:42:07,325 --> 00:42:09,525
My brother is dead.

467
00:42:10,605 --> 00:42:12,605
Where is Slean?

468
00:42:18,645 --> 00:42:20,645
You killed the Skinshifter.

469
00:42:25,605 --> 00:42:28,605
Now it can't tell us who
set this all in motion.

470
00:42:30,845 --> 00:42:32,845
I suppose not.

471
00:42:32,885 --> 00:42:36,685
But what if someone knew the
man who tried to ransom Scorann?

472
00:42:38,885 --> 00:42:40,885
Remembered his name.

473
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:42,925
From years ago.

474
00:42:46,845 --> 00:42:48,845
All through the ride home...

475
00:42:48,885 --> 00:42:50,885
I couldn't bring it to mind.

476
00:42:50,925 --> 00:42:52,925
Where I knew him from.

477
00:42:55,605 --> 00:42:57,605
But then I remembered.

478
00:42:58,685 --> 00:43:00,685
From when I was a boy.

479
00:43:01,765 --> 00:43:03,765
When I came to Bregan.

480
00:43:03,805 --> 00:43:06,925
To visit you and to see the
Whale Road for the first time.

481
00:43:09,605 --> 00:43:11,605
Vlade was your man.

482
00:43:16,445 --> 00:43:18,445
You're behind all this.

483
00:43:19,565 --> 00:43:21,214
You wanted to be Jarl, but you didn't want

484
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:23,869
to be seen to betray your own sister.

485
00:43:26,725 --> 00:43:28,725
It almost worked.

486
00:43:40,445 --> 00:43:42,445
And what now?

487
00:43:49,503 --> 00:43:52,085
Slean!

488
00:44:02,445 --> 00:44:04,445
Your uncle saved my life today.

489
00:44:04,485 --> 00:44:06,485
Did he? Really?

490
00:44:07,565 --> 00:44:10,045
The Skinshifter's woman, did she talk?

491
00:44:12,445 --> 00:44:14,662
Then we're no closer to knowing
who was behind its actions.

492
00:44:14,663 --> 00:44:17,805
Or the taking of Scorann.

493
00:44:18,645 --> 00:44:20,645
I'm sure the truth will out.

494
00:44:29,925 --> 00:44:34,165
I lay my claim to become Jarl of all
the Shieldlands before this Gathering.

495
00:44:34,205 --> 00:44:36,085
Is this a joke?

496
00:44:37,725 --> 00:44:39,472
- Next time...
- The next time we meet,

497
00:44:39,473 --> 00:44:41,418
it'll be as enemies.

498
00:44:42,645 --> 00:44:45,165
- Do you see something?
