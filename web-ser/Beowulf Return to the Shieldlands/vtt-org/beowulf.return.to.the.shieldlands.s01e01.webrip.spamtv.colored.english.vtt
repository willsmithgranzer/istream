27:21.320 --> 27:23.320
He had motive.

27:24.080 --> 27:27.600
Bayen turned him away
from Hrothgar's body.

27:27.680 --> 27:29.680
He threatened him.
Threatened?

27:31.520 --> 27:33.960
It was banter, between old friends.

27:35.320 --> 27:38.280
Do it here, quick and clean.

27:42.520 --> 27:45.640
Make your decision on the present,
not the past.

27:45.720 --> 27:48.400
As a thane, not as a mother.

27:48.480 --> 27:51.200
She was never your mother!
Be quiet!

27:54.640 --> 27:57.200
You're nothing, Beowulf.
Your father was nothing.

27:57.280 --> 28:01.040
Stop it! Now!
He tried to kill me.

28:01.120 --> 28:03.480
It was an unprovoked attack.

28:04.640 --> 28:07.040
Beowulf tried to kill my son.

28:07.120 --> 28:09.120
Our son.

28:13.200 --> 28:16.320
It will be done in the usual place.

28:16.400 --> 28:18.400
Before any who wish to see.

28:19.360 --> 28:21.360
That is our law.

28:35.520 --> 28:38.400
Can I come?
Not today.

28:38.480 --> 28:41.400
I've a long way to go
and I want to be back before dark.

28:42.320 --> 28:44.320
Next time.

28:46.520 --> 28:48.760
(CLICKS TONGUE)

29:26.080 --> 29:28.880
Ah! My new daughter.
I'm sorry?

29:28.960 --> 29:30.920
Your mother and I -
What did you do to her?

29:31.000 --> 29:32.760
Married her, then shared her bed.

29:32.840 --> 29:34.920
Isn't that your custom?

29:39.120 --> 29:41.320
LILA: Stop!

29:41.400 --> 29:43.320
What were you thinking?!

29:44.960 --> 29:46.600
I wasn't.

29:47.320 --> 29:49.680
I had my way, they'd kill you
with your friend.

29:53.880 --> 29:55.080
What?

30:34.120 --> 30:36.080
Elvina!
Easy.

30:36.160 --> 30:38.080
She went that way.
What happened to her?

30:38.160 --> 30:40.320
A mud-born beast,
he chased after her.

30:40.400 --> 30:41.800
Where?
Past the corral.

30:41.880 --> 30:43.880
Toward the Western Wood?

30:51.280 --> 30:53.120
Took your time.

30:56.640 --> 30:58.320
Whoa! Steady.

31:03.560 --> 31:05.080
Stop them!

31:20.760 --> 31:23.360
RHEDA: Slean?
What do you think you're doing?

31:29.960 --> 31:32.160
If he's ever to take
Hrothgar's place,

31:32.240 --> 31:34.440
he must be seen as a warrior.

31:34.520 --> 31:37.800
As I'm not?
Rheda, I...

31:37.880 --> 31:40.400
It's true.

31:40.480 --> 31:43.680
I may never wield a sword
or lead the Huskarl into battle.

31:45.720 --> 31:47.720
I'll never be Hrothgar.

31:49.640 --> 31:52.000
But I will rule.

31:57.360 --> 31:59.880
(HORSE NEIGHING)

33:53.360 --> 33:56.640
Dead barghest. Beast killed it.

33:56.720 --> 33:59.760
Found her here.
And probably took her.

33:59.840 --> 34:02.040
There's a chance.
Beowulf.

34:12.320 --> 34:15.040
Finish them.
Oi, oi, me?

34:15.920 --> 34:17.920
I hardly know him.

34:19.880 --> 34:21.800
Hrothgar would be proud (!)

34:21.880 --> 34:24.000
Getting others to do
your killing for you.

34:24.080 --> 34:26.760
One year you lived with us.
What do you know of my father?

34:26.840 --> 34:30.480
Come on, then.
I won't even put up a fight.

34:31.200 --> 34:33.400
Or do I scare you that much?

34:33.480 --> 34:35.600
If that's how you want it.

34:35.680 --> 34:37.680
He's got a knife!

34:40.640 --> 34:43.360
Before you get close enough
to use those, he'll be dead.

34:43.440 --> 34:45.440
Do it!

34:45.520 --> 34:48.280
Anger makes a man of you.
I'm not the boy you knew.

34:48.360 --> 34:50.360
No?

34:51.960 --> 34:54.000
You want him? Be my guest.

34:54.680 --> 34:57.480
Then go and explain to his mother
what happened.

34:59.440 --> 35:01.600
(GRUNTS)

35:03.080 --> 35:05.080

35:58.800 --> 36:00.720
Tell me this isn't about the girl.

36:00.800 --> 36:04.280
Not just her.
I pledged to avenge Bayen.

36:04.360 --> 36:06.360
He's dead. What's it matter?

36:07.480 --> 36:09.520
More tracks. Deeper.

36:09.600 --> 36:11.080
It's carrying her.

36:12.160 --> 36:14.160
This way.

36:46.560 --> 36:49.280
How did men drive giants
from these lands?

36:49.360 --> 36:51.320
Before my time.

37:03.760 --> 37:07.240
I heard giants ate human babies.

37:07.320 --> 37:10.640
Wives' tales.
You're not scared?

37:13.720 --> 37:15.560

Look out!

Agh!

Yaaagh!

(SHRIEKS)

39:20.600 --> 39:22.920
How is he?!

39:23.000 --> 39:25.640
Doubt I'll see morning.

39:25.720 --> 39:27.200
He'll live.

39:27.280 --> 39:29.600
Lila? My widow.

39:30.680 --> 39:34.280
Your husband believes every cloud
has a darker one behind it.

39:34.360 --> 39:36.440
There's nothing more
you can do here.

39:38.080 --> 39:40.400
There. Can you?

39:41.000 --> 39:43.840
Where are you going?
Bayen's body must be prepared.

39:44.800 --> 39:46.880
He's dead. What about me?

39:47.400 --> 39:50.480
Aw.
(GROANS)

39:52.200 --> 39:55.080
Cut from the mud-born
that killed Bayen.

39:55.160 --> 39:57.640
Not from any I've seen.

39:59.600 --> 40:05.720
Before it came here, the beast
had been slaughtering crofters
on the Northern Road.

40:05.800 --> 40:08.400
A pretty story.
But it proves nothing.

40:09.480 --> 40:12.280
Beowulf saved Elvina's life
and returned here.

40:12.360 --> 40:14.320
That proves something.

40:14.400 --> 40:15.880
Only that he wants her.

40:22.200 --> 40:24.040
You may look upon Hrothgar's body.

40:25.960 --> 40:27.960
Then you will go.

40:38.360 --> 40:40.360
(DOG BARKING)

40:45.920 --> 40:48.120
It should've been me that saved you.

40:48.720 --> 40:51.320
You already have. Many times.

40:51.400 --> 40:53.400
I'd have cut the beast's head off.

40:53.680 --> 40:55.440
Then I'm glad it wasn't you.

40:56.560 --> 40:58.560
See you tonight?

41:06.320 --> 41:08.280
Did you find the rosewater?

41:11.280 --> 41:13.280
Let me help.

41:23.800 --> 41:25.560
What is it?

41:41.280 --> 41:43.840
Worried I might steal something?

41:43.920 --> 41:45.920
If you did, I'd know.

41:49.000 --> 41:52.080
There are no secrets from me
within this hall.

41:52.160 --> 41:54.160
Beowulf.

42:20.960 --> 42:25.000
This hall will always be your home,
Beowulf.

42:28.400 --> 42:30.280
Slean is your half-brother.

42:31.840 --> 42:33.680
You're all my blood.

42:34.960 --> 42:36.760
My son.

42:38.720 --> 42:41.240
Nobody else knows.

43:00.960 --> 43:03.040
You don't belong here.

43:04.760 --> 43:06.760
Never did.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.360
HROTHGAR: 'Heorot will need you.'

43:26.400 --> 43:28.960
Your brother will need you.

43:31.200 --> 43:33.280
'And you will come.'

43:37.560 --> 43:40.680
What will you do now?
Finish what I started.

43:40.760 --> 43:43.680
Kill the mud-born. It wasn't
the beast that killed Bayen.

43:43.760 --> 43:48.240
How do you know?
The wound wasn't inflicted
by a beast. He was stabbed.

43:49.480 --> 43:52.240
Bayen had enemies here?
He was Hrothgar's reeve.

43:52.320 --> 43:55.680
Mine, too.
All of Heorot's enemies were his.

43:55.760 --> 43:57.600
And there are many.

43:57.680 --> 43:59.960
Even in a time of peace.

44:00.800 --> 44:04.760
Well, whoever it was,
I'll find them...

44:04.840 --> 44:06.360
and kill them.

44:07.760 --> 44:09.240
It's a skin-shifter!

44:09.320 --> 44:11.760
People fear skin-shifters
more than other mud-born

44:11.840 --> 44:14.200
Because they can live amongst us
undetected.

44:14.280 --> 44:16.680
If word gets out,
there will be panic.

44:16.760 --> 44:19.320
Can you find the thing and kill it?
If it's still here.

44:21.120 --> 44:23.840
I've been a walking, talking
dead man for 15 years.

44:23.920 --> 44:25.880
Why are you here?
The killer was mud-born.

44:25.960 --> 44:27.960
You can't think it's me.
