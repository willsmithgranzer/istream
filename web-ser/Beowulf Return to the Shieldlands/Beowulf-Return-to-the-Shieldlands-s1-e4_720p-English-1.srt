Rheda to lose the vote.

I helped save your life.

163
00:12:23,268 --> 00:12:25,628
Rheda, you believe this?

164
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:36,988
Without my warriors

165
00:12:37,028 --> 00:12:39,868
this new Jarl of yours is powerless.

166
00:12:40,308 --> 00:12:42,308
Without the Varnis

167
00:12:42,348 --> 00:12:47,348
you're just a sorry collection of
farmers, fishers and miners.

168
00:12:49,108 --> 00:12:51,468
You need us!

169
00:12:54,468 --> 00:12:56,468
You leave me no choice.

170
00:12:58,828 --> 00:13:00,828
My first act as Jarl...

171
00:13:01,428 --> 00:13:04,228
is to expel the Varni
from the Alliance.

172
00:13:05,068 --> 00:13:07,828
Without honour, no
matter how powerful,

173
00:13:07,868 --> 00:13:09,988
a man is no better than a Mudborn.

174
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:17,348
(CHUCKLES)

175
00:13:17,388 --> 00:13:19,388
This is a joke.

176
00:13:19,428 --> 00:13:21,748
Hm? A joke.

177
00:13:36,428 --> 00:13:39,628
- No!
- You ordered Bayen's death.

178
00:13:39,668 --> 00:13:41,275
- And my brother?
- For the good of all

179
00:13:41,275 --> 00:13:43,666
whatever price need be paid.

180
00:13:43,788 --> 00:13:45,908
- Your words.
- Beowulf.

181
00:13:45,948 --> 00:13:47,948
Now is not the time.

182
00:13:48,388 --> 00:13:50,988
- Next time...
- Next time we meet...

183
00:13:51,988 --> 00:13:54,468
... it'll be as enemies.

184
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:35,879
You're going then?

185
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:38,239
I'm not a Thane's son.
I have no choice.

186
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,279
You saw what choice I have.

187
00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:46,129
My mother wants to drive us apart.
That's why she's sending you.

188
00:14:46,129 --> 00:14:47,404
Maybe she's right.

189
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:50,839
You'll be married to another
woman. We have no future.

190
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,239
- I won't let it happen.
- There are no happy endings.

191
00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:55,535
Don't you understand that?

192
00:14:56,359 --> 00:15:00,039
- What future have we ever had?
- I've never let that stand between us.

193
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,079
And yet here we are.

194
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,839
You may come to love this girl.

195
00:15:34,999 --> 00:15:36,999
You're going with them?

196
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,639
- Is that a problem?
- Why would it be?

197
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,719
- You've greased them.
- This is some of my best work...

198
00:15:51,119 --> 00:15:53,519
- for some girl's dowry.
- For Herot's future.

199
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:57,399
- You have a gift.
- If the dowry doesn't reach Mere,

200
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:00,719
the deal Gorrik made
with Rheda is void.

201
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:10,279
It's two days hard ride
east to Old Mere.

202
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,719
- Then?
- Beyond the marshes.

203
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:15,399
The Island of Dunes.

204
00:16:16,719 --> 00:16:18,719
My parents were of the Mere.

205
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:21,879
Gorrik knew a way.

206
00:16:22,239 --> 00:16:25,319
The Warig couldn't reach us.
That's how we survived.

207
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:28,039
What are they like, the Warig?

208
00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:31,719
Ugly, stupid and brutal.

209
00:16:33,319 --> 00:16:35,319
I know the kind.

210
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:37,839
I don't think I
introduced my daughter.

211
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:41,319
He's not man enough to be
my mother, let alone my father.

212
00:16:41,359 --> 00:16:43,759
(CHUCKLES) We should leave.

213
00:16:58,719 --> 00:17:00,753
I'm sick of hearing
stories and never

214
00:17:00,778 --> 00:17:02,543
having the chance to live them.

215
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,759
You will, one day.

It's nothing.

of a stalking troll.

Less.

222
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,959
Fetch her in to ride with
us or send her home.

223
00:18:12,999 --> 00:18:15,519
Nah, I'll leave her out
there a bit longer.

224
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:19,559
You heard what she said.

225
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:22,039
I'm not man enough to be her mother.

226
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:26,119
But are you man enough
FOR her mother?

227
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:29,359
Maybe that's the real problem.

Yes, of course.

Then you should know
what I'm planning.

261
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:46,119
- Which is...?
- One law,

one custom, one people.

263
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,359
Common laws cut into pillars

and placed in every settlement
across the Shieldlands.

265

people adhere to it or answer to me.

I'll listen to what others
have to say, but yes.

The laws are decided
up on by each Thane

and then agreed by their own people.

That is our way.

We can't cling to the old ways
and forge a new future.

That's your failing.

That's why you could never be Jarl.

And you are? Because you
shared Hrothgar's bed?

You don't mean that.

comes only from love.

Home of the Mere.

487
00:43:51,432 --> 00:43:54,112
Good to see you again, friend.

488
00:43:56,072 --> 00:43:58,072
(LAUGHS)

489
00:44:03,472 --> 00:44:05,472
You're alive?

490
00:44:06,312 --> 00:44:08,312
Is that going to be awkward?

491
00:44:10,552 --> 00:44:12,552
Should it be?

492
00:44:12,992 --> 00:44:14,592
No.

493
00:44:23,352 --> 00:44:25,272
That's it.

494
00:44:25,312 --> 00:44:27,952
Now all we have to do is
give Gorrik the dowry

495
00:44:27,992 --> 00:44:30,912
and get Slean's bride
safely back to Herot.

496
00:44:32,392 --> 00:44:34,392
What could possible go wrong.

497
00:44:49,512 --> 00:44:51,512
(RUMBLING)

498
00:44:59,992 --> 00:45:03,312
Have a little respect for
your elders and betters.

499
00:45:04,552 --> 00:45:06,059
- Vlade?
- Abrecan wants to know

500
00:45:06,084 --> 00:45:07,512
if you'll help him become

501
00:45:07,552 --> 00:45:09,872
Jarl of the Shieldlands
in Rheda's place.

502
00:45:09,912 --> 00:45:12,992
And the prize you are
here to take from us...

503
00:45:13,472 --> 00:45:15,472
Mara... my firstborn.

504
00:45:15,672 --> 00:45:17,872
She's burning up. What's
wrong with her?

505
00:45:17,912 --> 00:45:20,004
- Sea fever.
- My father would rather it

506
00:45:20,029 --> 00:45:21,192
was I who was sick.

507
00:45:21,232 --> 00:45:22,912
No father would ever wish that.

508
00:45:22,952 --> 00:45:25,992
The Warig believe that a gland
found in the sand wrym's neck

509
00:45:26,032 --> 00:45:28,912
- can be used to fight the fever.
- We have to hunt the sand wrym.

510
00:45:28,952 --> 00:45:31,552
You know when you're drunk
and the ground moves?

511
00:45:31,592 --> 00:45:33,592
- What if you're not drunk?
- Sand wryms!

512
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:36,905
