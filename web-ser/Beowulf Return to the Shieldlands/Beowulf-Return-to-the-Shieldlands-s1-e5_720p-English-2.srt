1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,208
- Roth of the Mere.
- Your husband

2
00:00:08,233 --> 00:00:10,160
promised us iron weapons.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,240
However, they must not be
simply a gift, but a dowry.

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,560
A marriage between my son
and his daughter

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,600
will make our alliance stronger.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,200
You'll go to Mere.
And take Elvina with you.

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,160
- Why?
- She knows their ways,

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,360
and you will forget her now.

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,120
- Did you see something?
- It's nothing.

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,520
You're behind all this.
You wanted to be Jarl,

11
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,320
but you didn't want to be seen
to betray your own sister.

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,800
Vlade was your man.

13

14
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,720
We'll see you on the road to Mere.

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,760
Now all we do is give Gorrik the dowry

16
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,200
and get Slean's bride
safely back to Herot.

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,600
What could possibly go wrong?

18
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,200
Are you sure this is the right way?

19
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,720
Roth said the Island
of Dunes. That's it.

20
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,520
I'm tired.

21
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,920
We can eat and rest in Mere.

22
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,840
Hurry - the tide's coming in.

23
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,640
Hey! Hey!

24
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,120
A little help?

25
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,520
You know when you're drunk,
and the ground moves?

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,320
What if you're not drunk?

27
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,360
Sandwyrm!

28
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,280
Move! Quickly! Head to the dunes!

29
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,440
Leave it, Beowulf! Leave it!

30
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,480
Beowulf, hurry! We'll be
safe on the dunes.

31
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,200
Run!

32
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,640
Sandwyrms? You didn't
think to mention that?

33
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,080
I'd heard stories. I didn't
think they were real.

34
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,600
I am Beowulf, Reeve of Herot,

35
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,200
here at Gorrik's request to
escort his daughter back

36
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,360
to marry the son of our Thane.

37
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,040
To bind our people.

38
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,360
Yista erya kessu a! Yeh kuruyethu a!

39
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,400
- W-What did he say?
- How about some food... and sleep?

41
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:45,320
Quick as you can! Hey, out of the way!

42
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,960
Coming through!

43
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,280
That's it, boys. Well done!

44
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,360
Mind your backs! Cart coming through!

45
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,880
Come on, boys!

46
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,800
That's it. Wheelbarrow...
just in there.

47
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,960
Move it! You're blocking the way.

48
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,120
- You said: dump it here.
- I said: there.

49
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,240
Do it yourself.

50
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,200
Move it, or I'll smelt your
feral bones to ash.

51
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,920
I love it when you talk dirty.

52
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,080
Right. What's going on?

53
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,200
Tell this miner to move
his grimy iron ore.

54
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,840
It's a smelter's job.

55
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,760
Do it. Now.

56
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,040
Just once, can the miners not start
a fight with the smelters?

57
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,920
Well, where's the fun in that?

58
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,840
Oi, beautiful! Warm your
bed for later!

59
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,160
- Where are the others?
- I speak for them all now.

60
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,240
We drew straws, and
I lost. They're afraid.

61
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,800
They've heard about the
Skinshifter. And we're out of salt.

62
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,640
It only arrived today from Bregan.

63
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,160
Oi! Get that load up to the Hall.
Then half a cart for the miners.

64
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,040
Slean! I need to talk to you.

65
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,480
- How much ore have you brought?
- Only three carts.

66
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,720
- You want payment in kind?
- Yeah.

67
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:23,200
We need new spikes, two dozen new
ring-locks and pick-axe heads.

68
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,280
Whatever's left we'll
take in food and coin.

69
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,320
See to it.

70
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,600
What is it?

71
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,360
The stuff he wants... we don't
have it, not even half of it.

72
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,800
Vishka's been working on the
weapons for the dowry.

73
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,080
- How long will it take?
- I don't know. She's not here.

74
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,120
Find her!

75
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,640
You look thirsty.

76
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,520
Have a drink.

77
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,840
I want the tools. Now.

78
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,080
Or what?

79
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,320
Or I might just take
our ore to the Varni.

80
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,680
Since Rheda banished their
Thane from the Alliance,

81
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,000
they've been poaching your smelters.

82
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,320
So... they can forge their
own iron weapons.

83
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,240
And they're paying more than you.

84
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,320
A lot more.

85
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,800
If you want to take your
life in your own hands...

86
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,160
then go ahead and deal with the Varni.

87
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,200
Otherwise, you'll be paid tonight.

88
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,320
Tonight the price is double.

89
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,680
I set the price. By law.

90
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,000
The word is, Rheda's making new laws.

91
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,792
You want to go and ask Rheda to

92
00:07:31,793 --> 00:07:33,544
- change the law?
- Why not?

93
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,240
Seems they have Warig
problems of their own.

94
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,760
What is it?

95
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,160
Remember the time my father
came back early from the hunt?

96
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,720
- How could I forget?
- I can see it now.

97
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,160
Him peering into the tent to check
that no man was with me.

98
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,919
It's them. They've come for you.

99
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,000
- It can't be.
- Who else?

100
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,160
You must go back. Play along.

101
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,760
As soon as dark comes,
slip away. I'll meet you here.

102
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,040
I'd die before I'd be with another.

103
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,680
Let me speak to your Thane. Gorrik.

104
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,920
We're tired and hungry,
and she's injured.

105
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,440
Hesta askuya eklathuai ma,
ni-hesse eklathuai reh?

106
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,040
You speak the old tongue. Who are you?

107
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,440
My parents were Mere.
They fled the massacre.

108
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,680
So, you've come back to your people.

109
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,360
Untie us. Our business is with
Gorrik, not his guard-dogs.

110
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,440
What do you expect me to do with this?

111
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,000
Have a little respect for
your elders and betters.

112
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,040
Gorrik.

113
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,520
You're supposed to be the
Reeve. Where have you been?

114
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,160
Search them.

115
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,960
Where's Roth? Where's the messenger
I sent to Herot to guide you here?

116
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,120
He died.

117
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,680
- How?
- We were attacked by Warig.

118
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,320
I told you... the Warig.
They killed Roth.

119
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,360
Where's the dowry? Where are my
weapons? I don't see them.

120
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,560
And you won't, until you feed
us and show us the bride.

121
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,450
- Father, you're needed.
- Not now.

122
00:11:09,475 --> 00:11:11,504
It's Shay. You have to come now.

123
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,680
Give them water. No food.

124
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,560
Father, if Shay dies, the  people
may lose hope altogether.

125
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,040
Where's your sister?
Where's Mara? Is she safe?

126
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,800
Is Mara safe?

127
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,520
Move her.

128
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,520
Was that the party from Herot?

129
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,560
We need this alliance with them.

130
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,680
If you injure them, all the work
you've done to keep our people safe

131
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,720
will have been for nothing.

132
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:39,141
Come before me again for stealing,
and I'll take your hands,

133
00:12:39,181 --> 00:12:40,941
not just your coin.

134
00:12:40,981 --> 00:12:43,376
He gets what he deserves!

135
00:12:43,401 --> 00:12:44,541
That's not right!

136
00:12:44,581 --> 00:12:46,581
Out of the way. Out of the way.

137
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,541
We're being robbed!

138
00:12:50,821 --> 00:12:53,181
- Who's stealing from you?
- He is.

139
00:12:53,221 --> 00:12:55,661
And you are.

140
00:12:58,101 --> 00:13:00,901
- Excuse me?
- You're excused... Thane...

141
00:13:00,941 --> 00:13:02,941
Wait.

142
00:13:03,781 --> 00:13:07,701
I dealt with your father. I can
deal with this much man.

143
00:13:10,021 --> 00:13:12,021
That's right.

144
00:13:12,781 --> 00:13:14,781
Say your piece.

145
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:18,061
My name is Greff.

146
00:13:18,981 --> 00:13:21,901
I was born out there,
in one of those pits,

147
00:13:21,941 --> 00:13:25,301
where we scrape together the
ore that pays for all of this.

148
00:13:25,341 --> 00:13:27,341
The ore that makes you rich.

149
00:13:27,381 --> 00:13:31,021
So, in return, I and the
others out there,

150
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:33,941
we ask for a fair price
for the blood and sweat

151
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:35,581
we spill to bring it here.

152
00:13:35,621 --> 00:13:38,781
- We pay what the market will bear.
- Not today, you didn't.

153
00:13:39,501 --> 00:13:41,501
Why not?

154
00:13:43,181 --> 00:13:46,981
Because the smithies were working on
the weapons for the Mere dowry.

155
00:13:48,021 --> 00:13:49,901
The tools will be ready this evening,

156
00:13:49,941 --> 00:13:52,701
yet he is demanding that
we pay him double,

157
00:13:52,741 --> 00:13:54,741
if he has to wait.

158
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:58,781
Or... make a new law.

159
00:13:59,301 --> 00:14:02,301
Say what each cart is
worth until next winter.

160
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,581
Give us fair prices that
don't go up and down

161
00:14:04,621 --> 00:14:06,461
like the temper of a Wulfing wench.

162
00:14:09,901 --> 00:14:13,381
That... or I will take
our ore to the Varni.

163
00:14:15,781 --> 00:14:18,381
Don't mistake laughter
for support, Greff.

164
00:14:18,421 --> 00:14:21,381
They'll be cheering if I order
you hanged for insolence.

165
00:14:25,621 --> 00:14:27,621
But you're right.

166
00:14:28,461 --> 00:14:30,861
The work...

167
00:14:30,901 --> 00:14:33,261
the risks you take out
there in the forest...

168
00:14:33,301 --> 00:14:35,461
should be fairly rewarded.

169
00:14:39,861 --> 00:14:41,781
You will have your law.

170
00:14:44,501 --> 00:14:47,821
But only if you earn it
by showing loyalty.

171
00:14:47,861 --> 00:14:51,661
Award Herot sole rights to
any ore that you mine.

172
00:14:52,301 --> 00:14:54,341
No more talk of the Varni.

173
00:14:54,381 --> 00:14:57,661
And you'll wait until this
evening to be paid.

174
00:14:59,741 --> 00:15:02,781
If I have the law, you have my word.

175
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:15,101
We will reconvene shortly.

176
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:22,181
You yield to every demand
that's made of you.

177
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:25,301
Are you talking about
my laws or your marriage?

178
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,501
Both. You should have asked.

179
00:15:28,621 --> 00:15:30,821
Marriage should have been my choice.

180
00:15:30,861 --> 00:15:34,741
I said the same thing to my father
when I was told to marry Hrothgar.

181
00:15:36,701 --> 00:15:39,181
- You said you loved him.
- I did.

182
00:15:40,301 --> 00:15:42,301
After a time.

183
00:15:45,661 --> 00:15:47,741
You were with someone before Father?

184
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,541
Erm...

185
00:15:52,021 --> 00:15:54,101
He married another girl from Bregan.

186
00:15:56,901 --> 00:15:59,101
He was a terrible fisherman.

187
00:15:59,141 --> 00:16:01,621
And he grew very, very, very fat.

188
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,541
It was a lucky escape.

189
00:16:11,381 --> 00:16:14,061
I loved your father as I
never thought I would.

190
00:16:16,061 --> 00:16:19,901
Sometimes choices made
for us are the best,

191
00:16:19,941 --> 00:16:22,061
without emotions clouding judgment.

192
00:16:26,381 --> 00:16:28,901
I was angry with the
miner, but he was right...

193
00:16:29,501 --> 00:16:32,781
... and our power rests on their
hard work and co-operation.

194
00:16:34,301 --> 00:16:37,221
He'll have his payment before sunset.

195
00:16:42,181 --> 00:16:45,541
Slean, I'll need you to set the price.

196
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:57,501
- He's growing up.
- And when he's full-grown...

197
00:16:58,341 --> 00:17:00,341
... will you step aside?

198
00:17:14,781 --> 00:17:16,781
Away you go.

199
00:17:19,781 --> 00:17:22,381
These people - they're scared.

200
00:17:41,381 --> 00:17:44,661
We've not had visitors for a long time.

201
00:17:48,621 --> 00:17:50,621
You must eat.

202
00:17:57,501 --> 00:17:59,501
The alley. Now.

203
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,661
- Go ahead.
- Vlade...

204
00:18:04,981 --> 00:18:07,301
You're alive? What do you want?

205
00:18:07,341 --> 00:18:09,181
Abrecan wants to know
if you'll help him

206
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:11,941
become Jarl of the Shieldlands
in Rheda's place.

207
00:18:13,941 --> 00:18:16,101
Betray my mother to
further his ambition?

208
00:18:16,141 --> 00:18:20,021
And your own. Your reward will be to
take her place as Thane of Herot.

209
00:18:21,381 --> 00:18:23,821
As Abrecan's vassal?

210
00:18:23,861 --> 00:18:26,381
We all serve somebody or something.

211
00:18:27,781 --> 00:18:30,101
I leave for Bregan before nightfall.

212
00:18:30,141 --> 00:18:32,141
You have your answer ready.

213
00:18:47,021 --> 00:18:49,621
It's good of you to have
come all this way.

214
00:18:53,421 --> 00:18:55,461
Be seated, guests.

215
00:19:02,861 --> 00:19:04,861
Daughters...

216
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,741
Sit.

217
00:19:23,901 --> 00:19:27,301
And the prize you are
here to take from us...

218
00:19:28,781 --> 00:19:32,101
Mara, my first-born.

219
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:36,701
It is an...

220
00:19:39,181 --> 00:19:41,701
It is an honour to bind
our tribes in marriage.

221
00:20:05,941 --> 00:20:08,741
For our honoured guests.

222
00:20:09,901 --> 00:20:11,621
What is that?

223
00:20:11,661 --> 00:20:14,141
Sandwyrm. This one's a year old.

224
00:20:14,181 --> 00:20:17,581
We preserved it for a
special occasion.

225
00:20:19,101 --> 00:20:21,781
- It's a year old?
- Eat.

226
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:24,621
The longer it's kept,
the better it tastes.

227
00:20:34,261 --> 00:20:36,261
Hmm. I've had worse.

228
00:20:53,581 --> 00:20:57,181
Lila, the miners must have
their payment by tonight.

229
00:20:57,221 --> 00:20:59,301
I can't do this without Vishka.

230
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,341
Nobody's seen her.

231
00:21:05,661 --> 00:21:07,501
What are you doing?

232
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,541
If you can do better, help yourself.

233
00:21:10,781 --> 00:21:12,781
Give me that.

234
00:21:22,221 --> 00:21:24,901
Don't just stand there. Bellows.

235
00:21:25,981 --> 00:21:28,381
Brinni, come on. We've
got to get this done.

236
00:21:34,821 --> 00:21:36,821
Mmm.

237
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:40,061
Maybe we got off on the
wrong foot with Gorrik.

238
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,421
Some Sandwyrm, and you're anybody's.

239
00:21:47,501 --> 00:21:49,501
How did you hurt your arm?

240
00:21:50,821 --> 00:21:52,381
Warig arrow.

241
00:21:52,421 --> 00:21:57,061
The man who brought us here, Roth,
had a daughter, who was a healer.

242
00:21:57,781 --> 00:21:59,781
Is she here?

243
00:22:00,341 --> 00:22:03,181
Shay? No. She's not here.

244
00:22:09,341 --> 00:22:14,261
This Slean must count himself the
luckiest man in the Shieldlands,

245
00:22:14,301 --> 00:22:16,781
to be married to my daughter.

246
00:22:19,981 --> 00:22:22,781
Then why doesn't he come
here to fetch her himself?

247
00:22:25,821 --> 00:22:28,581
Slean had duties in Herot.

248
00:22:28,621 --> 00:22:31,101
It's not as if that is the only insult.

249
00:22:32,021 --> 00:22:34,821
They let Roth give his
life to protect the dowry,

250
00:22:34,861 --> 00:22:36,501
and then refuse to present it...

251
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:38,541
Enough!

252
00:22:39,501 --> 00:22:41,501
He's right, though, isn't he?

253
00:22:42,181 --> 00:22:45,341
I see no dowry, no groom.

254
00:22:45,381 --> 00:22:49,461
All you have to give me
are words, words, words...

255
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:53,181
that twist and writhe
like eels in my head.

256
00:22:53,221 --> 00:22:57,061
You've seen the bride.
You've eaten at my table.

257
00:22:57,101 --> 00:22:59,821
Where are my iron weapons?

258
00:23:00,781 --> 00:23:02,901
Mara?!

259
00:23:02,941 --> 00:23:05,181
- Mara?
- She's burning up.

260
00:23:07,741 --> 00:23:09,461
What's wrong with her?

261
00:23:09,501 --> 00:23:11,501
Sea fever.

262
00:23:13,741 --> 00:23:16,141
Get me liquor. We need
to bring down her fever.

263
00:23:16,181 --> 00:23:18,781
Ah, it's not the food.

264
00:23:18,821 --> 00:23:21,581
- Why should I trust you?
- I'm a healer.

265
00:23:23,581 --> 00:23:25,741
Give her whatever she needs!

266
00:23:28,221 --> 00:23:30,221
Rub her limbs with it.

267
00:23:37,221 --> 00:23:40,141
If it's sea fever, there must
be others that are sick.

268
00:23:41,901 --> 00:23:43,901
Take me to them... now.

269
00:23:50,581 --> 00:23:53,181
This is where we care for our sick.

270
00:24:12,901 --> 00:24:15,421
- Your healer...?
- You're looking at her.

271
00:24:15,461 --> 00:24:19,021
- She's a child.
- The children of Mere grow up fast.

272
00:24:20,461 --> 00:24:22,141
You should have told us.

273
00:24:22,181 --> 00:24:25,501
And have you tell Rheda
the Mere are feeble and sick?

274
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:29,301
- Would you prefer proud and dead?
- I'd prefer to have Roth here alive.

275
00:24:29,341 --> 00:24:32,101
Instead, I'm to tell his
daughter, if she survives,

276
00:24:32,141 --> 00:24:34,141
that she's an orphan.

277
00:24:35,261 --> 00:24:37,621
If this marriage doesn't happen,

278
00:24:37,661 --> 00:24:40,941
we won't have Rheda's iron
weapons to defend ourselves...

279
00:24:42,061 --> 00:24:44,061
... and we'll all die.

280
00:25:12,145 --> 00:25:14,345
Where did you learn to do this?

281
00:25:16,465 --> 00:25:19,505
Right here. The old
smith, Marton, taught me.

282
00:25:19,545 --> 00:25:21,545
He was a good man.

283
00:25:22,425 --> 00:25:24,665
Kind.

284
00:25:24,705 --> 00:25:26,985
I used to come down
here when my father...

285
00:25:27,945 --> 00:25:30,065
... when I didn't want to
have to think any more

286
00:25:30,105 --> 00:25:32,185
about who I was or
what my duties were.

287
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,865
We all have to hide away sometimes.

288
00:25:37,425 --> 00:25:39,905
It's just a shame we have
to go back out there.

289
00:26:04,465 --> 00:26:06,145
Can you save her?

290
00:26:06,185 --> 00:26:08,825
So she can be forced to marry
a man who doesn't want her?

291
00:26:08,865 --> 00:26:11,345
If I was her, I'd be glad
to get out of here.

292
00:26:11,385 --> 00:26:15,145
It's not 'here'...  it's 'who'.
She's in love with the Reeve.

293
00:26:15,185 --> 00:26:17,345
Sounds familiar.

294
00:26:17,385 --> 00:26:19,945
Oh, don't flatter yourself!

295
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,865
She's very weak...

296
00:26:23,905 --> 00:26:26,745
but there might be a way we
can help her and these others.

297
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:30,705
My father said the Warig believe a
gland in the Sandwyrm's neck

298
00:26:30,745 --> 00:26:32,985
could be used to fight the fever.

299
00:26:33,025 --> 00:26:35,385
What would Mudborn
know of such things?

300
00:26:35,425 --> 00:26:37,425
It's her only hope.

301
00:26:41,025 --> 00:26:43,065
But, anyway, there's only so long

302
00:26:43,105 --> 00:26:45,425
before you have to tell
Gorrik the dowry's lost.

303
00:26:45,465 --> 00:26:48,305
So, we have to hunt a Sandwyrm?

304
00:26:51,385 --> 00:26:53,505
I'll speak to him.

305
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:09,825
Beautiful.

306
00:27:09,865 --> 00:27:12,265
It's for Mara. For the wedding.

307
00:27:15,865 --> 00:27:18,265
My father would rather
it was I who was sick.

308
00:27:20,025 --> 00:27:22,025
No father would ever wish that.

309
00:27:27,945 --> 00:27:29,945
Do you want to try?

310
00:27:36,065 --> 00:27:38,465
She has an old soul, that one.

311
00:27:39,305 --> 00:27:41,385
And her mother's mind.

312
00:27:44,225 --> 00:27:46,105
Where's my dowry?

313
00:27:46,145 --> 00:27:48,145
You can't fight illness with iron.

314
00:27:54,345 --> 00:27:56,345
You don't need weapons.

315
00:27:56,745 --> 00:27:58,745
You need medicine.

316
00:27:59,065 --> 00:28:03,265
Swords may not fight the fever,
but they can cut down Mudborn.

317
00:28:03,745 --> 00:28:06,505
As a warrior, you understand that.

318
00:28:08,185 --> 00:28:11,185
Old as I am, I put
you in the dirt, didn't I?

319
00:28:13,585 --> 00:28:15,705
Why reach out to Herot now?

320
00:28:15,745 --> 00:28:19,145
The Warig. Their war
bands are coming together.

321
00:28:19,185 --> 00:28:22,465
This time, they mean to
destroy us. All of us.

322
00:28:23,345 --> 00:28:25,145
- How do you know?
- That dead Warig we

323
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:26,345
hung up above the dunes

324
00:28:26,385 --> 00:28:28,385
talked before it died.

325
00:28:29,265 --> 00:28:35,042
There's a prophet moving through
the Edgelands, stirring them up.

326
00:28:35,425 --> 00:28:37,545
They call him Red Tongue.

327
00:28:37,585 --> 00:28:39,705
They say he drinks human blood.

328
00:28:40,545 --> 00:28:43,105
The days of peace are over.

329
00:28:43,145 --> 00:28:45,905
As sure as the tide, war is coming.

330
00:28:48,545 --> 00:28:52,625
You'll give me my weapons at first
light, or I'll keep your healer,

331
00:28:52,665 --> 00:28:57,185
cut your throats and tell Rheda the
Sandwyrm swallowed the lot of you.

332
00:28:58,225 --> 00:29:00,745
The Wyrms may be your
daughter's only chance.

333
00:29:02,225 --> 00:29:04,825
Elvina believes there's a
gland in the beast's neck

334
00:29:04,865 --> 00:29:07,825
that can be used against the
fever. If we kill one of them...

335
00:29:07,865 --> 00:29:10,545
We don't hunt them any
more. It's too dangerous.

336
00:29:13,145 --> 00:29:15,145
Then I'll go alone.

337
00:29:16,465 --> 00:29:18,465
And die for your trouble.

338
00:29:20,705 --> 00:29:22,625
The Wyrms are territorial.

339
00:29:22,665 --> 00:29:25,825
They never stray across
each other's boundaries.

340
00:29:25,865 --> 00:29:28,905
Only we know the paths
that lie between them.

341
00:29:29,905 --> 00:29:31,905
That's why we're safe here.

342
00:29:35,145 --> 00:29:37,145
But you'll go, anyway.

343
00:29:38,465 --> 00:29:40,465
Won't you?

344
00:30:00,025 --> 00:30:02,025
It's harder than it looks.

345
00:30:02,465 --> 00:30:06,145
My father said all the women in
Herot have beautiful gowns of gold.

346
00:30:06,785 --> 00:30:10,305
And there's a great hall for
feasting, food all year round...

347
00:30:10,345 --> 00:30:12,345
You're laughing at me. Why?

348
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:15,065
Do I look like I wear gowns?

349
00:30:17,265 --> 00:30:19,265
Herot is...

350
00:30:21,145 --> 00:30:23,145
Well, I used to think it was boring.

351
00:30:24,145 --> 00:30:26,785
- But now...
- You miss it?

352
00:30:29,665 --> 00:30:32,865
I wouldn't miss it
here, if I left ever.

353
00:30:41,985 --> 00:30:44,625
- Mara...
- Rowan?

354
00:30:44,665 --> 00:30:47,305
I'll never let them take
you away from me.

355
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,345
You won't have to.

356
00:30:50,385 --> 00:30:53,865
They don't have the
dowry. It is lost.

357
00:30:53,905 --> 00:30:55,905
Are you sure?

358
00:30:56,385 --> 00:30:58,385
I overheard them.

359
00:31:01,465 --> 00:31:06,025
Tell my father. Without the weapons,
he'll never agree to them taking me.

360
00:31:08,225 --> 00:31:10,025
Which one is Shay, Roth's daughter?

361
00:31:10,065 --> 00:31:12,465
Vishka, please, go back
to the settlement.

362
00:31:12,905 --> 00:31:14,905
I'm the reason her father's dead.

363
00:31:15,985 --> 00:31:18,905
If I can survive the Warig,
I think I can fight a fever.

364
00:31:33,985 --> 00:31:36,425
I'll string them up with the Warig!

365
00:31:36,465 --> 00:31:38,625
No dowry. No weapons.

366
00:31:39,185 --> 00:31:42,225
Damn them. Nobody
cheats me and lives.

367
00:31:42,265 --> 00:31:46,985
We survived out here for years
because we trusted no-one.

368
00:31:47,025 --> 00:31:48,825
Cared only for each other.

369
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,945
Speak plainly.

370
00:31:50,985 --> 00:31:54,505
If Beowulf wishes to hunt the Wyrm
for the gland that can save Mara,

371
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:57,545
let him. I will help him.

372
00:31:57,585 --> 00:31:59,585
Why?

373
00:31:59,985 --> 00:32:01,985
What's in it for you?

374
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:04,545
If she lives...

375
00:32:06,025 --> 00:32:08,025
... she'll be mine.

376
00:32:09,905 --> 00:32:11,665
I knew it.

377
00:32:11,705 --> 00:32:13,705
Yes or no?

378
00:32:18,745 --> 00:32:20,745
Save Mara...

379
00:32:21,385 --> 00:32:24,265
... kill Beowulf, and we have a deal.

380
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:14,425
Over there.

381
00:33:14,465 --> 00:33:16,865
- What do I do with this?
- Try not to miss.

382
00:33:17,665 --> 00:33:19,665
Bring it to us, Beowulf.

383
00:33:27,065 --> 00:33:29,065
Hold.

384
00:33:29,545 --> 00:33:32,665
Hold. Hold.

385
00:33:33,105 --> 00:33:35,185
Hold!

386
00:33:46,145 --> 00:33:48,145
Aaaarghh!

387
00:33:50,625 --> 00:33:53,105
Aim for the neck! Now!

388
00:33:55,185 --> 00:33:57,185
Rowan, throw it!

389
00:34:00,945 --> 00:34:02,905
I can't hold it. Help me.

390
00:34:08,065 --> 00:34:10,065
We've got it now!

391
00:34:11,505 --> 00:34:13,505
Finish it!

392
00:34:23,784 --> 00:34:25,784
Where's the gland?

393
00:34:34,425 --> 00:34:36,425
It looked better on a plate.

394
00:34:39,465 --> 00:34:41,465
Got it.

395
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:46,784
Wishing you hadn't
eaten all that Sandwyrm?

396
00:34:49,264 --> 00:34:52,945
Hey! How are we supposed
to find our way back?

397
00:34:52,985 --> 00:34:55,385
Gorrik knows there's no dowry.

398
00:34:55,425 --> 00:34:57,425
Return, and he will kill you.

399
00:35:00,705 --> 00:35:02,705
Beowulf...

400
00:35:14,265 --> 00:35:16,665
Looks like we've bagged
ourselves a bride.

401
00:35:21,945 --> 00:35:24,145
Gorrik, I have the gland.

402
00:35:24,185 --> 00:35:26,345
- And Beowulf?
- Will not return.

403
00:35:28,745 --> 00:35:30,665
Take it to the healer.

404
00:35:30,705 --> 00:35:33,305
See that Mara is treated first.

405
00:35:37,065 --> 00:35:39,065
She's mine now.

406
00:35:40,745 --> 00:35:42,745
Here.

407
00:35:48,665 --> 00:35:50,665
Keep up.

408
00:35:59,145 --> 00:36:01,385
We don't have to go back.

409
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:03,665
Without somebody who knows the path,

410
00:36:03,705 --> 00:36:06,185
we'll probably be eaten
before we get there.

411
00:36:06,225 --> 00:36:08,545
If we leave and don't
deliver the dowry,

412
00:36:08,585 --> 00:36:10,585
Gorrik will kill Elvina and Vishka.

413
00:36:11,225 --> 00:36:13,505
We just need to follow
his footsteps back.

414
00:36:20,705 --> 00:36:22,985
They got the gland
from a Wyrm, didn't they?

415
00:36:23,025 --> 00:36:25,025
You can save Mara, can't you?

416
00:36:25,825 --> 00:36:27,825
She has a chance now.

417
00:36:34,065 --> 00:36:36,065
How many more to go?

418
00:36:37,145 --> 00:36:39,065
That's it. Done.

419
00:36:39,105 --> 00:36:42,185
Rheda will be grateful. You
saved her from looking a fool

420
00:36:42,225 --> 00:36:44,225
in front of the miners.

421
00:36:48,305 --> 00:36:51,465
Fixed prices, to be reviewed
at the agreed time,

422
00:36:51,505 --> 00:36:54,385
in return for Herot's exclusive
rights to the mines.

423
00:36:54,425 --> 00:36:57,065
- The law you asked for.
- Make your mark.

424
00:36:58,385 --> 00:37:01,265
I'm a miner.

425
00:37:01,305 --> 00:37:03,505
My word's stronger
than any parchment.

426
00:37:06,025 --> 00:37:07,745
Let's leave it at that, shall we?

427
00:37:07,785 --> 00:37:10,065
Brinni, help him load
this onto his cart.

428
00:37:12,145 --> 00:37:14,785
The smith girl. She did well...

429
00:37:15,585 --> 00:37:17,705
... considering no-one could find her.

430
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:24,345
Even as a boy, you always had
the capacity to surprise me.

431
00:37:25,665 --> 00:37:27,665
Just like your father.

432
00:37:28,185 --> 00:37:30,185
He would be proud of you.

433
00:37:50,105 --> 00:37:52,385
I don't understand.

434
00:37:52,425 --> 00:37:54,945
Everyone else is responding
but your sister.

435
00:38:06,345 --> 00:38:08,345
It's the dowry.

436
00:38:10,145 --> 00:38:12,145
Here's your dowry.

437
00:38:21,185 --> 00:38:24,825
Once Slean's wed to your
daughter, there'll be more.

438
00:38:24,865 --> 00:38:26,865
As much as Herot can spare.

439
00:38:30,945 --> 00:38:33,225
We leave as soon as
Mara's fit to travel.

440
00:38:37,905 --> 00:38:39,905
See how my daughter is.

441
00:38:54,905 --> 00:38:58,105
Where's Rowan? Why
hasn't he come for me?

442
00:38:59,465 --> 00:39:01,465
I'm here.

443
00:39:09,465 --> 00:39:11,465
She's dying.

444
00:39:13,905 --> 00:39:15,905
Did you tell my father?

445
00:39:16,545 --> 00:39:18,545
Am I yours?

446
00:39:20,505 --> 00:39:23,145
Yes, my love. We'll be together.

447
00:39:23,185 --> 00:39:25,185
And we'll have six children.

448
00:39:27,425 --> 00:39:29,305
More, if you'd like.

449
00:39:51,905 --> 00:39:53,905
Mara...

450
00:40:12,385 --> 00:40:14,385
Mara's dead.

451
00:40:33,585 --> 00:40:35,585
I'm so sorry.

452
00:40:53,465 --> 00:40:55,225
Gorrik...

453
00:40:55,265 --> 00:40:58,465
I... have... a daughter to bury.

454
00:41:01,665 --> 00:41:05,305
Tell Rheda I withdraw my vote.

455
00:41:28,625 --> 00:41:30,785
If war is coming, you need us.

456
00:41:30,825 --> 00:41:32,825
He's right.

457
00:41:33,945 --> 00:41:36,583
You were wise to reach out to Herot.

458
00:41:37,945 --> 00:41:40,545
Without these weapons and
the support of the Alliance,

459
00:41:40,585 --> 00:41:42,865
our people will wither
away and die here.

460
00:41:45,465 --> 00:41:48,105
We must keep our word to Rheda.

461
00:41:48,145 --> 00:41:51,345
My daughter is dead.

462
00:41:51,385 --> 00:41:53,385
You have another.

463
00:41:55,745 --> 00:41:57,745
I forbid it.

464
00:41:59,985 --> 00:42:01,985
Kela, I...

465
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:04,625
I need you here.

466
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:09,025
But you will release me.

467
00:42:10,305 --> 00:42:12,825
So I can be Slean's
bride, for the Mere.

468
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:17,065
And my sister's memory.

469
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:23,105
You have your weapons.

470
00:42:24,545 --> 00:42:27,407
I'm sorry. It's the only way.

471
00:42:29,265 --> 00:42:31,265
Take her.

472
00:42:33,025 --> 00:42:35,025
Does your support for Rheda stand?

473
00:42:40,425 --> 00:42:42,425
It does.

474
00:42:50,825 --> 00:42:52,825
Thank you.

475
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:02,665
You can tell Abrecan my answer is no.

476
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:04,705
Then you are a fool.

477
00:43:05,345 --> 00:43:08,425
Your father was right
to pass you over

478
00:43:08,465 --> 00:43:10,545
and your mother to
make you her smith.

479
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:16,900
Well, tell my uncle I'll choose
my destiny. And his.

480
00:43:18,385 --> 00:43:20,385
Go!

481
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:38,185
Take care over the sands
and on your journey home.

482
00:43:38,225 --> 00:43:40,225
These men will escort you.

483
00:43:44,385 --> 00:43:46,385
Watch over her.

484
00:43:46,705 --> 00:43:48,785
The Mere are no longer alone, Gorrik.

485
00:43:49,505 --> 00:43:52,603
If you need us, send word.

486
00:43:52,665 --> 00:43:55,345
All the tribes will have
need of each other,

487
00:43:55,385 --> 00:43:58,860
as the tides of blood that
are coming wash over us.

488
00:45:31,865 --> 00:45:33,305
War is coming.

489
00:45:33,345 --> 00:45:36,145
They have a leader. A
prophet, they call him.

490
00:45:36,185 --> 00:45:37,705
He tells them the time has come

491
00:45:37,745 --> 00:45:39,342
to wash the Shieldlands clean with

492
00:45:39,367 --> 00:45:40,665
- red blood.
- You're safe here.

493
00:45:40,705 --> 00:45:42,945
- You're not prepared for an attack.
- Then fix it.

494
00:45:42,985 --> 00:45:44,825
Herot needs a real Thane.

495
00:45:44,865 --> 00:45:48,665
And the Shieldlands need
a true Jarl to lead its tribes.

496
00:45:48,705 --> 00:45:50,745
You could be one and I the other.

497
00:45:50,785 --> 00:45:53,025
It's real!

498
00:45:53,065 --> 00:45:54,465
Troll!

499
00:45:55,305 --> 00:46:01,887
