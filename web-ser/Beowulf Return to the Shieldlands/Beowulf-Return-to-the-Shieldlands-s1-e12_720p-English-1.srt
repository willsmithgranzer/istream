1
00:00:04,846 --> 00:00:11,086
I see a land. A land
where the Mudborn roam freely...

2
00:00:15,566 --> 00:00:18,366
amongst the broken stones...

3
00:00:20,726 --> 00:00:22,726
and empty halls...

4
00:00:22,766 --> 00:00:24,766
that were once our homes.

00:00:24,806 --> 00:00:26,006
(SCREAMS)

6
00:00:27,966 --> 00:00:30,465
Our enemies can detect Herot's weakness

7
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,526
because it is ruled by a woman.

8
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:35,886
If war is coming, we need to prepare.

9
00:00:35,926 --> 00:00:40,206
Some say there's no bond stronger than
blood but I don't believe that.

10
00:00:40,246 --> 00:00:44,686
Iron, threat, opportunity
brought us here.

11
00:00:44,726 --> 00:00:48,206
May the ancestors forgive me,
but that's stronger than blood.

12
00:00:49,046 --> 00:00:52,204
This land needs a warrior
at its heart to

13
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:55,310
bring its people through this darkness.

14
00:00:58,086 --> 00:01:01,126
The Shieldlands need a
jarl who will protect us...

15
00:01:03,246 --> 00:01:06,726
a man of strength who will take control.

16
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:09,286
- For glory!
- (YELLS)

17
00:01:09,326 --> 00:01:11,206
We must be strong.

18
00:01:11,886 --> 00:01:14,566
And I must be Jarl!

Abrecan's army will be upon us soon.

22
00:02:06,446 --> 00:02:08,446
Let Slean command beside Beowulf.

23
00:02:08,485 --> 00:02:11,606
The Huskarla look to him. They'll
- They'll do as I say.

24
00:02:12,606 --> 00:02:14,606
Beowulf is in command.

25
00:02:15,686 --> 00:02:20,006
He was willing to die for you...
for all of us. Does that mean nothing?

26
00:02:21,446 --> 00:02:23,707
The only reason he's not in chains is

27
00:02:23,732 --> 00:02:26,110
because we need every fighter we have.

28
00:02:28,366 --> 00:02:30,366
Even traitors.

29
00:02:49,406 --> 00:02:51,406
I'm glad Rate didn't kill you.

30
00:02:51,446 --> 00:02:53,446
Well, that makes two of us.

31
00:02:57,206 --> 00:02:59,206
You wanted something?

32
00:03:02,206 --> 00:03:04,326
- I've been thinking...
- Careful.

33
00:03:08,966 --> 00:03:10,686
What were you thinking?

- Maybe we could find a way to...

37
00:03:29,966 --> 00:03:32,006
Anything is possible.

38
00:03:34,886 --> 00:03:36,246
Now, go.

39
00:03:51,046 --> 00:03:53,166
I should have held them
longer at that bridge.

40
00:03:53,206 --> 00:03:55,366
I should have died there.

41
00:03:55,406 --> 00:04:00,046
Whatever else you've done, you
put your father's sword to good use.

42
00:04:00,086 --> 00:04:02,206
Hrothgar would be proud.

43
00:04:02,246 --> 00:04:04,086
It's you who he wanted to hold this.

44
00:04:05,526 --> 00:04:08,966
Hrothgar's gone. You're his blood.

45
00:04:09,006 --> 00:04:11,364
Rheda will forgive in time. And one day,

46
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:13,631
like that sword, Herot will be yours.

47
00:04:15,246 --> 00:04:17,046
But right now, we've a battle to win.

48
00:04:21,805 --> 00:04:24,246
It'll take time for
their army to assemble.

49
00:04:25,246 --> 00:04:28,286
We're protected on our
right by these cliffs.

50
00:04:28,326 --> 00:04:31,486
And our steep slopes to our
left mean any attack that way

51
00:04:31,526 --> 00:04:33,526
would cost them half their force.

52
00:04:35,006 --> 00:04:37,086
So they'll come at us head-on.

53
00:04:37,126 --> 00:04:39,126
- Ready yourselves!
- (CHEERING)

54
00:04:41,726 --> 00:04:45,206
I know what it is to be ignored
by a father who favours another.

55
00:04:45,606 --> 00:04:48,966
What it is to be always passed
over. How it can cripple a child.

56
00:04:49,006 --> 00:04:50,606
It didn't cripple you, did it?

57
00:04:51,686 --> 00:04:53,286
Men are weaker.

58
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:55,326
Your father underestimated you.

59
00:04:56,246 --> 00:04:59,766
As you underestimate
Slean, again and again.

60
00:05:01,286 --> 00:05:05,326
What he did, he did because he
was robbed of his dignity by Hrothgar...

61
00:05:06,726 --> 00:05:08,726
of his future by you.

62
00:05:14,286 --> 00:05:17,326
He reached out for power because
he is ready for it.

63
00:05:19,046 --> 00:05:20,686
Step aside.

64
00:05:22,286 --> 00:05:24,086
Let him show you.

65
00:05:25,686 --> 00:05:27,686
Tread carefully, child.

(SIGHS)

67
00:05:43,086 --> 00:05:45,406
An army of thieves.

68
00:05:45,446 --> 00:05:49,846
When the rest of their army
arrive, let them bring the fight to us.

69
00:05:51,286 --> 00:05:54,766
Herot. This time, I
enter as a conqueror.

70
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,366
Not as a supplicant.

71
00:05:58,406 --> 00:06:00,566
Or a younger brother.

72
00:06:01,566 --> 00:06:04,486
Which one is Beowulf?
The one next to Slean.

73
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:07,686
- And with him?
- Breca.

74
00:06:07,726 --> 00:06:10,126
Some thief he calls his friend.

75

(SPITS)

76
00:06:18,526 --> 00:06:24,286
As you all wait patiently for the
rest of my warriors to gather,

77
00:06:24,326 --> 00:06:29,326
let me introduce to you some
of those who will end your lives

78
00:06:29,366 --> 00:06:32,046
and take your women.

80
00:06:35,286 --> 00:06:37,046
Beltane!

81
00:06:37,086 --> 00:06:39,086
First of my warriors!

82
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,326
Son of the fearsome Einar!

83
00:06:43,366 --> 00:06:47,566
Grandson of the great hero Greyblade!

84
00:06:47,606 --> 00:06:52,046
Beltane has already
cut down more than 40,

85
00:06:52,086 --> 00:06:55,246
40 of your Shieldlanders,

86
00:06:55,286 --> 00:06:58,366
- killing beasts with his bare hands!
- Spear.

87
00:06:58,406 --> 00:07:01,286
And single-handedly raising...

88
00:07:02,126 --> 00:07:03,686
Argh!

89
00:07:06,686 --> 00:07:08,686
No one likes a show-off.

90
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,686
Archers!

91
00:07:39,446 --> 00:07:40,846
Beowulf.

92
00:07:40,886 --> 00:07:44,206
You swore your man would
see the Varni join us.

93
00:07:44,246 --> 00:07:47,846
Do two lone Norsemen
frighten the Wulfings?

94
00:07:48,406 --> 00:07:51,286
What brings you to
Herot? A change of heart?

95
00:07:51,326 --> 00:07:53,326
An offer I couldn't refuse.

96
00:07:56,646 --> 00:07:58,646
They won't make their attack yet.

97
00:08:02,966 --> 00:08:04,446
Rate.

98
00:08:04,486 --> 00:08:06,486
Thank you for coming.

99
00:08:06,526 --> 00:08:09,366
How could I refuse the
invitation Varr delivered?

100
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:11,846
Varr.

101
00:08:13,566 --> 00:08:15,366
Rheda.

102
00:08:15,406 --> 00:08:17,406
Invitation?

103
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:21,966
- I don't see your warriors.
- They wait on my signal.

104
00:08:23,046 --> 00:08:25,656
Rheda swore on her ancestors'
blood that if

105
00:08:25,681 --> 00:08:28,230
the Varni came to Herot's
defence, she...

106
00:08:29,246 --> 00:08:30,846
What was it?

107
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:33,405
That I would take you as my husband.

108
00:08:36,885 --> 00:08:38,566
And the important part?

109
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:47,206
That you and I would rule over
all the Shieldlands... as joint Jarl.

110
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:03,286
The letter Varr delivered
was a last resort.

111
00:09:03,326 --> 00:09:05,686
Only he and I could know.

112
00:09:06,526 --> 00:09:08,806
- Are my people ready?
- They are.

113
00:09:08,846 --> 00:09:11,526
- And the attack?
- Will come soon.

114
00:09:15,646 --> 00:09:18,526
The things that happened... in the past.

115
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:20,886
Between us.

116
00:09:20,926 --> 00:09:23,446
Lying to Hrothgar on Slean's behalf?

117
00:09:23,486 --> 00:09:25,486
Having me banished?

118
00:09:25,526 --> 00:09:28,526
You're more blunt than usual today.

119
00:09:28,566 --> 00:09:30,766
I did it to protect him.

120
00:09:32,646 --> 00:09:37,606
Why did you return to a
lying woman with a jealous child?

121
00:09:37,646 --> 00:09:40,526
- I came for Hrothgar.
- Hrothgar was dead.

122
00:09:40,566 --> 00:09:42,846
And you stayed. Why?

123
00:09:44,726 --> 00:09:46,566
You're my blood.

124
00:09:47,406 --> 00:09:49,366
You're my son.

125
00:09:50,806 --> 00:09:52,806
Nobody else knows.

00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:57,446
I'm the Reeve.

127
00:10:26,486 --> 00:10:28,486
We're not fighting today...

128
00:10:29,206 --> 00:10:31,286
for the iron they smelt in the pits.

129
00:10:32,286 --> 00:10:35,966
We're not fighting
for a thane or a jarl.

130
00:10:36,006 --> 00:10:38,006
We're fighting for family.

131
00:10:38,926 --> 00:10:40,926
For friends.

132
00:10:40,966 --> 00:10:42,646
For those we care for.

133
00:10:42,686 --> 00:10:45,406
For this walled piece
of dirt we call home.

134
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:49,446
- For Herot!

Tell the smelters to stand ready.

136

Today, we shall restore order.

137
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:01,966
And rekindle strength...

138
00:11:02,646 --> 00:11:08,206
by marching together into the fire!

The gate is holding!

146

Take positions!

00:11:52,276 --> 00:11:54,356
- Slean!
- I'll stay here till I die!

148
00:11:54,396 --> 00:11:55,516
Move! Now!

149
00:11:58,436 --> 00:12:00,316
What are we waiting for?

150
00:12:00,356 --> 00:12:02,356
The bride must prepare.

151
00:12:04,556 --> 00:12:06,356
Send for the Varni warriors now.

152
00:12:08,556 --> 00:12:11,276
Not until I have what I came for.

153
00:12:20,796 --> 00:12:22,436
Hold the pulley.

154
00:12:33,956 --> 00:12:35,596
On three... release.

155
00:12:35,636 --> 00:12:37,636
Two... three!

156
00:12:45,116 --> 00:12:46,716
Release.

157
00:13:00,636 --> 00:13:02,636
Hold!

158
00:13:38,196 --> 00:13:40,196
Well, I smell victory.

159
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,156
I won't wait any longer!

160
00:13:48,756 --> 00:13:51,676
Abrecan's army have
almost reached the smelting pits.

161
00:13:52,396 --> 00:13:54,836
Now send for your
men. I'm not married yet.

162
00:13:55,716 --> 00:13:57,916
Don't be a fool. You have my word.

163
00:13:57,956 --> 00:14:01,436
Rheda, you will marry me or Herot
will burn. Do not doubt my resolve.

164
00:14:01,476 --> 00:14:03,469
You married your son
off for Herot's sake.

165
00:14:03,494 --> 00:14:05,276
Surely you'd make the same sacrifice.

166
00:14:05,316 --> 00:14:07,267
There can be no truth-telling ceremony.

I brought a Varni so we could be

169

If you were my wife, I
would always hunt for you.

You will never go
hungry. Do you accept this

175
00:15:04,623 --> 00:15:07,300
meat from my best
horse as proof of this?

176
00:15:10,299 --> 00:15:12,796
How could I turn it down?

177
00:15:22,276 --> 00:15:23,316

191

They are only words, Rheda.

196

We must press the advantage.

197
00:17:27,396 --> 00:17:29,396
Back to the barricade!

198
00:17:32,556 --> 00:17:35,396
The Wulfing have almost
reached the barricade.

199
00:17:35,436 --> 00:17:37,756
Once your blood is
mixed, you will be wed.

200

Then I shall summon my men.

I'll take you to Elvina's.

Is Slean all right? They've
pulled back to the barricade.

That's all I know.

206

There must be wounded out
there. You need to see to them.

Rate is here. Rheda has
offered to marry him.

What do you mean she's gonna marry Rate?

You have no birthright.

217

You gave it up when you
joined your uncle in treason.

Oh, for once in your life, can you
please just be honest with yourself?

You never had any intention of
stepping aside for me, did you?

I did. At first.

whatever I had to to see you were Thane.

225

And I will. Whatever must be done.

is that we save Herot.

00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:47,196
Those are my people in there.

334
00:31:47,636 --> 00:31:49,796
As much as those of Bregan.

335
00:31:49,836 --> 00:31:51,956
I see no love for you here, Abrecan.

336
00:31:52,836 --> 00:31:58,196
If you rule this place,
you will only rule ashes.

337
00:32:00,556 --> 00:32:02,356
Pick it up!

338
00:32:02,956 --> 00:32:05,556
Break the doors down!

339
00:32:06,796 --> 00:32:08,916
(POUNDING CONTINUES)

340
00:32:12,276 --> 00:32:14,276
No. No. No. No.

341
00:32:15,076 --> 00:32:17,076
Let him die with his people.

342
00:32:28,756 --> 00:32:30,556
The Varni!

343
00:32:30,596 --> 00:32:33,116
Wulfings to the main gate!

344
00:32:34,196 --> 00:32:35,796
Ready?

345
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,596
Attack!

346
00:32:55,596 --> 00:32:58,196
ABRECAN: Let the
Wulfings fight the Varni.

347
00:32:58,956 --> 00:33:01,156
Break down the doors!

348
00:33:04,196 --> 00:33:06,196
(POUNDING RESONATES)

349
00:33:06,236 --> 00:33:08,076
Open the doors.

350
00:33:09,116 --> 00:33:11,476
Rheda, they'll kill us all.

351
00:33:11,516 --> 00:33:13,756
They'll be in here soon anyway.

352
00:33:17,636 --> 00:33:19,636
I'll do this my way.

353
00:33:28,516 --> 00:33:30,596
Hold your ground! Hold your ground!

354
00:33:32,676 --> 00:33:35,836
Hallam. It's Hallam, isn't it?

355
00:33:36,756 --> 00:33:39,276
I remember you from my days in Bregan.

356
00:33:39,316 --> 00:33:41,436
You were a fisherman, I recall.

357
00:33:43,876 --> 00:33:48,276
So tell me, what brings you and your
friends to call on your jarl?

358
00:33:50,356 --> 00:33:54,396
Is it that my brother
has told you I am weak?

359
00:33:55,236 --> 00:33:57,236
Too weak to face our enemies?

360
00:33:57,276 --> 00:33:59,516
Yet, here I am.

361
00:34:01,156 --> 00:34:03,156
And he is the enemy.

362
00:34:05,236 --> 00:34:07,876
So where do you stand? With a traitor?

363
00:34:09,036 --> 00:34:10,716
Or with your true ruler?

364
00:34:17,356 --> 00:34:20,476
I am their ruler, Rheda.

365
00:34:22,755 --> 00:34:24,716
Kill her.

366
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,755
Kill her!

367
00:34:33,795 --> 00:34:35,396
Argh!

368
00:34:42,436 --> 00:34:47,396
Oh, look at you all.
So enthralled by her.

369
00:34:48,636 --> 00:34:50,436
Kill her!

370
00:34:51,315 --> 00:34:53,315
Kill her!

371
00:35:05,596 --> 00:35:07,396
Rheda.

372
00:35:07,436 --> 00:35:09,036
Argh!

373
00:35:11,956 --> 00:35:15,356
As I love you... please.

374
00:35:26,716 --> 00:35:28,276
RATE: Rheda!

375
00:35:28,316 --> 00:35:31,516
I think you might be
my... favourite wife.

376
00:35:42,556 --> 00:35:44,556
People of Herot...

377
00:35:45,316 --> 00:35:47,676
warriors of Bregan...

378
00:35:47,716 --> 00:35:51,116
let's not leave all
the glory to the Varni.

379
00:35:51,156 --> 00:35:52,556
Huskarla!

380
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,516
Beowulf.

381
00:36:11,556 --> 00:36:13,036
Skellan.

382
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:16,396
I was beginning to
think you wouldn't come.

383
00:36:16,436 --> 00:36:17,796
(CHUCKLES)

384
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:22,036
You think I would leave without
your blood on my blade?

385
00:36:33,916 --> 00:36:35,236
(YELLS)

386
00:36:40,396 --> 00:36:44,356
I gave your brother what he'd
been asking for his whole life!

387
00:36:45,476 --> 00:36:47,036
Everything he deserved.

388
00:36:54,836 --> 00:36:57,676
My brother was a great
warrior, was he not?

389
00:36:58,676 --> 00:37:00,876
He died like a thief.

390
00:37:00,916 --> 00:37:03,396
That reminds me. How is your friend?

391
00:37:21,116 --> 00:37:22,716
(CHUCKLES)

392
00:37:23,476 --> 00:37:25,716
What did your friend die for exactly?

393
00:37:25,756 --> 00:37:27,036
Huh?

394
00:37:27,076 --> 00:37:30,396
To protect somebody
surrounded by a wall.

395
00:37:31,156 --> 00:37:35,596
Where's the glory in that, Beowulf?

396
00:37:39,676 --> 00:37:41,756
I'm gonna see you cry like a baby...

397
00:37:42,756 --> 00:37:45,356
watch your blood fill
these golden channels...

398
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:48,196
see you beg me for mercy...

399
00:37:48,236 --> 00:37:50,996
as you wish yourself dead!

400
00:37:52,996 --> 00:37:54,116
Beowulf!

401
00:37:59,276 --> 00:38:01,116
(GRUNTS)

402
00:38:03,956 --> 00:38:05,956
That's for Breca.

403
00:38:06,356 --> 00:38:07,676
(GRUNTS)

404
00:38:11,996 --> 00:38:14,196
And that's for me.

405
00:39:17,116 --> 00:39:18,676
Thank you.

406
00:39:18,716 --> 00:39:20,876
This belongs to you.

407
00:40:03,156 --> 00:40:05,156
(SNIFFS)

408
00:40:31,916 --> 00:40:34,956
Thank you... for all that you've done.

409
00:40:37,236 --> 00:40:40,836
Without you, Herot would be
lost and the Shieldlands doomed.

410
00:40:41,956 --> 00:40:43,956
You played your part.

411
00:40:48,316 --> 00:40:49,916
I did, didn't I?

412
00:40:51,996 --> 00:40:55,436
Abrecan may be dead and
the Wulfings bloodied...

413
00:40:57,196 --> 00:40:59,196
but we're not safe yet.

414
00:41:31,076 --> 00:41:33,076
Great Master of the Giants...

415
00:41:34,556 --> 00:41:36,625
I have come to seek your help in

416
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:39,276
driving mankind from the old realms...

417
00:41:39,316 --> 00:41:41,916
that they call the Shieldlands.

418
00:41:42,996 --> 00:41:44,996
