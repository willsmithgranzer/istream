1
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,420
You're nothing, Beowulf.

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,420
Your father was nothing.

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,460
Kill him.

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,220
There'll be no more blood spilt in
this hall while I'm Reeve.

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,300
- I'm here to see Hrothgar.
- Hrothgar is dead.

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,340
One Thane must rule us all. Why not you?

7
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,585
Would you rather it was
someone else? I saw you.

8
00:00:19,587 --> 00:00:21,098
Talking to him?

9
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,179
- You're different to the old healer.
- I know.

10
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,019
All yours.

11
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,660
A Mudborn killed Bayen.

12
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:30,100
If I'm not avenged... I'll never
enter the Halls of the Dead.

13
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,299
I will avenge you.

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,780
The wound wasn't from
a beast. He was stabbed.

15
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,420
You don't belong here. Never did.

16
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:40,780
Slean is your half-brother. You're
my blood. My son.

17
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,220
Herot will need you, and you will come.

19
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:15,420
Today... Hrothgar, Thane of Herot,

20
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,660
will enter the Halls of the Dead.

21
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,339
But my husband is not lost to you.

22
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,940
Take off your father's sword.

23
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,860
Raise it.

24
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,060
Higher.

25
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,060
(cheering)

26
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,900
(woman singing)

27
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,580
Rate, the others might be
at Herot already.

28
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,020
Ride ahead and tell Rheda

29
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,620
the Varni Thane will come
in his own time.

30
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,660
For now... I feel like fishing.

31
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,540
(both laugh)

32
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,060
Hyar!

00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,660
What are you doing here?

35
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:23,340
- These are the Reeve's quarters.
- Now he's gone, what will you do?

36
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,860
It's my responsibility
to find Bayen's killer.

37
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,900
I'll leave you to it.

38
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,060
Bayen used to talk about
you all the time.

39
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,860
Mostly about how he thought Hrothgar
wished YOU were his son, not Slean.

40
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,500
(chuckles)

41
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,940
Old men like to tell stories.

42
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:46,420
When people stop listening, they tell
them a little louder.

43
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,460
Make them a little bigger.

44
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,140
Beowulf...

45
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,780
I never thanked you. You saved my life.

46
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,700
I wasn't there for you. I was there
for the beast.

47
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,860
Still... thank you.

48
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,060
- May I ask you a question?
- Go ahead.

49
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,620
Are you Slean's woman?

50
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,140
Only, I saw him leave your
home this morning.

51
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,100
You did?

52
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,140
I did.

53
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,700
I don't belong to any man.

54
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,700
Then...

55
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,740
We're close.

56
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,580
- Is Breca awake?
- He has company.

57
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,900
- Wife?
- Children.

58
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,940
Quick, even for him.

59
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,340
I'm feeling lucky.

60
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,540
Feeling lucky.

61
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,700
Oh, yes!

62
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,500
Let me win back what I lost.

63
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,180
- Won't happen.
- Her parents'll beat her.

64
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,780
Really?

65
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,260
- It's character-building.
- (door opens)

66
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:16,380
Take what's yours and get out. And you.

67
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:22,180
- (sighs) Children?
- Find me a proper game.

68
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:25,140
If you want a proper game,
don't use loaded knuckles.

69
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:29,500
I'm a married man. I've
got responsibilities now.

70
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,220
(laughs) Up.

71
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,180
The healer said I have to rest.

72
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,940
Up. I need the mind of a murderer.

73
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,780
I told you - it was an accident.

74
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,500
What? (shouts) You mean, the
man you stuck a knife in... ?

75
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,100
All right! All right.

76
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,740
(groans)

77
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:59,420
That mark on Breca's throat - you
know it's from a noose, don't you?

78
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,060
Somebody had a reason
to put it round his neck.

79
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,420
- What do you think you're doing?
- Living.

80
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,717
Huh!

81
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:07,899
Vishka, it's six years
since your father died.

82
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,100
Why now? Why this one?

83
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,460
Er...

84
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,820
Vishka, we were going to...

85
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,220
the snares.

86
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,260
They need checking.

87
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,719
(sighs)

88
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:31,060
Hrothgar wasn't only Thane
of Herot. He was also Jarl,

89
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,820
leader of all the tribes
across the Shieldlands.

90
00:08:33,821 --> 00:08:36,693
And, to succeed him, you need a majority

91
00:08:36,693 --> 00:08:38,779
of the votes at the
Gathering. I'm not a child.

92
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,940
Then tell me how they'll vote.

93
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,900
- The Thanes will be here by sunset.
- (metal scraping)

94
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,820
The Wisdeth are farmers.

95
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,140
They need our iron, our warriors.
Their vote can be counted on.

96
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:58,540
Scorann is a good Thane and a friend
of Herot, but nothing can be counted on.

97
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,220
Go on.

98
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,300
Bregan is Abrecan's.

99
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,660
And my vote is yours.

100
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,780
And the forest people?

101
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,980
The Banning Thane has
a weak spot for you...

102
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,860
but his vote is uncertain.

103
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,900
Which leaves the Varni.

104
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,700
Rate wishes to see himself made Jarl
of the Shieldlands, instead of you.

105
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,740
But, in order to do so, he'd have
to convince the others you're weak.

106
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,780
So you lose the vote.

107
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,180
And if I do... ?

108
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,540
Rate could challenge you.

109
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,820
You'd have to defeat him in single combat.

110
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,660
Ah...

111
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,460
(wails)

112
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,220
What was that?

113
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:33,900
Bayen's body was here.
Imagine you stabbed him.

114
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,140
You make it sound like
I'm an expert at this.

115
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,180
(door opens)

116
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,260
Varni.

117
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,540
Varr. They said you were licking
boots here, but I didn't believe that.

118
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,260
Even of you.

119
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,940
Take me to the woman
who claims to be Thane.

120
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:54,100
Rheda will see you when she's ready.

121
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,900
You may wait in her chamber.

122
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,420
You said Bayen was
alive when you found him.

123
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,380
If I was the killer,

124
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,659
why would I leave him breathing,
with my name on his tongue?

125
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,220
- You were interrupted.
- Or I was wounded.

126
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,420
Then you'd have bled.

127
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,700
(gasps)

128
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,580
The black blood of a Mudborn.

129
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,580
The one that killed Bayen?

130
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,060
The beast carried no wound. I saw it.

131
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,180
Then there were two Mudborn here.

132
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,580
Leave us.

133
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,194
Where's Rate?

134
00:11:49,195 --> 00:11:51,995
The Varni Thane will come when he's ready.

135
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,540
I'm to see you're prepared for his arrival.

136
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,780
Inspect his quarters.

137
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,860
- Are you his handmaid?
- (door slamming)

138
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,980
I'll have you shown there,
and you can turn down the bed.

139
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:10,460
- You insult me.
- As your presence here insults me.

140
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,340
But that's the point, isn't it?

141
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:23,820
There's only one thing that's
blood can turn from black to red,

142
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,180
that can shift from Mudborn to human.

143
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:31,140
Tell him: if he wishes to be Jarl,

144
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,180
he will have to do better than that.

145
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,180
(grunts)

146
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,540
- Rheda...
- I'm fine.

147
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,540
- The thing that did this...
- ... was a Skinshifter.

148
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,580
And it's living among us.

149
00:13:00,943 --> 00:13:02,011
How could you let this happen?

150
00:13:02,012 --> 00:13:06,252
Let this thing get into
my sister's private chamber

151
00:13:06,292 --> 00:13:08,332
and threaten her life?

152
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:11,292
Slean's Huskarla are responsible
for the Thane's safety.

153
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,332
(thud)

154
00:13:13,372 --> 00:13:16,572
If you'd done what I asked
and found Bayen's killer,

155
00:13:16,612 --> 00:13:18,252
this Varni wouldn't be dead.

156
00:13:18,292 --> 00:13:22,372
How was I to know it was a Skinshifter?
None have been found here for years.

157
00:13:23,132 --> 00:13:25,132
Leave us. Now.

158
00:13:32,372 --> 00:13:35,364
We're sure this Skinshifter killed Bayen?

159
00:13:36,572 --> 00:13:38,692
- ABRECAN: Well, if not...
- (door slams)

160
00:13:38,732 --> 00:13:39,892
... who else?

161
00:13:39,932 --> 00:13:42,612
People fear Skinshifters
more than any other Mudborn,

162
00:13:42,652 --> 00:13:45,292
because they can live amongst us...

163
00:13:45,332 --> 00:13:47,332
undetected.

164
00:13:48,332 --> 00:13:52,012
The Thanes arrive here in a
few hours for the Gathering.

165
00:13:52,052 --> 00:13:56,152
You'll never win their support
if you can't even control Herot.

166
00:13:57,252 --> 00:13:59,882
Then we ride out to meet them.

167
00:13:59,892 --> 00:14:01,692
Delay their arrival.

168
00:14:01,732 --> 00:14:04,332
Slean, ride west to meet Scorann.

169
00:14:04,372 --> 00:14:07,883
You and I, brother, will
ride north to meet the others.

170
00:14:08,612 --> 00:14:12,572
You swore you'd avenge Bayen's killer.
Can you find this thing and kill it?

171
00:14:12,612 --> 00:14:14,612
If it's still here.

172
00:14:28,812 --> 00:14:32,081
- (sighs)
- What happened to you?

173
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:36,603
You expect me to run towards a Skinshifter?

174
00:14:37,452 --> 00:14:40,372
Give me a man to fight, or even a beast.

175
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:42,412
But one that's both?

176
00:14:42,932 --> 00:14:45,372
What's that?

177
00:14:45,412 --> 00:14:48,412
It used it to kill the
Varni. Maybe Bayen, too.

178
00:14:51,332 --> 00:14:55,332
It's been repaired. Dark
edge on the solder. See?

179
00:14:55,372 --> 00:14:59,880
The only other place I've
ever seen that... is on this.

180
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:02,132
(grunts)

181
00:15:04,572 --> 00:15:06,572
(groans)

182
00:15:07,372 --> 00:15:11,427
Your technique - you don't have any.

183
00:15:14,812 --> 00:15:16,812
(grunts)

184
00:15:18,172 --> 00:15:21,132
My leg - it still hurts.

185
00:15:21,972 --> 00:15:23,412
What's wrong with you?

186
00:15:23,452 --> 00:15:26,092
I'm better with a blade than
you, but I can only make them.

187
00:15:26,132 --> 00:15:28,172
You get to use one in battle.

188
00:15:28,212 --> 00:15:30,212
You're not better than me.

189
00:15:31,852 --> 00:15:34,092
Well, not yet.

190
00:15:34,132 --> 00:15:35,932
And I didn't ask to be born a Huskarla.

191
00:15:35,972 --> 00:15:37,892
But you were, and I wasn't.

192
00:15:37,932 --> 00:15:40,892
An ancestor of mine saved
some ancestor of Hrothgar's.

193
00:15:40,932 --> 00:15:42,812
You don't appreciate what you have.

194
00:15:42,852 --> 00:15:46,172
You don't want anything. What's
the point of even being you?

195
00:15:48,452 --> 00:15:50,332
I'm sorry.

196
00:15:50,372 --> 00:15:52,372
It's not you I'm angry at.

197
00:15:54,572 --> 00:15:57,452
Vishka... I do want things.

198
00:15:57,492 --> 00:15:59,492
Like what?

199
00:16:00,212 --> 00:16:02,692
Another chance to plant
your backside in the mud.

200
00:16:02,732 --> 00:16:05,692
Show a woman has no place holding a sword.

201
00:16:07,812 --> 00:16:09,812
A woman?

202
00:16:10,452 --> 00:16:13,681
Come on. And this time, think.

203
00:16:13,692 --> 00:16:15,692
Don't just hack and slash.

204
00:16:18,532 --> 00:16:20,532
(groans)

205
00:16:21,332 --> 00:16:22,652
(moans)

206
00:16:22,692 --> 00:16:25,412
- Is this Vishka's work?
- Yes, it's hers.

207
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:28,412
But she's out, playing at being a Huskarla.

208
00:16:29,612 --> 00:16:31,932
As soon as she's back, I'll send her over.

209
00:16:33,252 --> 00:16:36,252
If it's Bayen's killer you're looking for,

210
00:16:36,292 --> 00:16:39,332
there was an argument at
the feast the other night.

211
00:16:39,372 --> 00:16:41,949
Him and a smelter, Tarn.

212
00:16:42,332 --> 00:16:44,332
That's all I know.

213
00:16:46,052 --> 00:16:48,052
That's helpful. (clears throat)

214
00:16:49,372 --> 00:16:52,452
You go on. Look into it.

215
00:16:52,492 --> 00:16:54,492
I'll catch up.

216
00:16:56,452 --> 00:16:58,452
Take a cold bath first.

217
00:16:59,372 --> 00:17:01,372
(chuckles)

218
00:17:03,812 --> 00:17:07,051
- (door closes)
- He likes to think he's funny.

219
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:09,092
I thought that was you.

220
00:17:26,771 --> 00:17:31,052
If we work together, we've got a better
chance of finding the Skinshifter.

221
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:33,572
This thing murdered Bayen.

222
00:17:35,292 --> 00:17:38,412
A man I had worked
alongside for seven years.

223
00:17:41,052 --> 00:17:43,252
Know a smelter called Tarn?

224
00:17:43,292 --> 00:17:45,292
He's their leader.

225
00:17:48,892 --> 00:17:50,892
- Are you going there alone?
- No.

226
00:17:51,652 --> 00:17:53,652
You're coming.

227
00:18:02,212 --> 00:18:04,972
Life's hard here. People come and go.

228
00:18:06,492 --> 00:18:08,972
Some scrape together
enough coin to buy a claim

229
00:18:09,012 --> 00:18:10,892
and move back to the mines.

230
00:18:10,932 --> 00:18:12,812
Others go back to the Farlands.

231
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:17,237
Those that do stay
- they don't see old age.

232
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:23,972
- I take it you're lost.
- We want to speak to Tarn.

233
00:18:24,012 --> 00:18:25,749
And I want to live up in that hall

234
00:18:25,774 --> 00:18:27,932
on the hill and drink wine whenever I like.

235
00:18:27,972 --> 00:18:31,492
Have some fine-boned Huskarla
sit on my lap as I sip it.

236
00:18:31,532 --> 00:18:34,652
A woman like you can do better
than those red-cloaked pretty boys.

237
00:18:34,692 --> 00:18:37,772
(chuckles) But I like them pretty.

238
00:18:37,812 --> 00:18:42,332
Beowulf right?
I'd say you were pretty. Once.

239
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:44,932
(chuckles) If only we'd met then.

240
00:18:44,972 --> 00:18:47,012
(chuckles)

241
00:18:47,052 --> 00:18:49,052
Will you take us to Tarn?

242
00:18:51,772 --> 00:18:53,772
(troll growling)

243
00:19:03,452 --> 00:19:05,892
(growling)

244
00:19:05,932 --> 00:19:07,932
Tarn!

245
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,012
Feed them meat. They get a taste.

246
00:19:23,052 --> 00:19:26,172
They get a taste... They can't get enough.

247
00:19:26,212 --> 00:19:27,772
What is it you want?

248
00:19:27,812 --> 00:19:30,532
The other night, you argued with Bayen.

249
00:19:30,572 --> 00:19:33,252
Did I? And how's that your business?

250
00:19:33,292 --> 00:19:36,292
You think, because you carved a
couple of fingers off a Mudborn,

251
00:19:36,332 --> 00:19:39,092
you can come down here
and accuse a man of murder?

252
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:41,812
That is what you're doing?

253
00:19:42,972 --> 00:19:44,972
I'm just talking.

254
00:19:48,252 --> 00:19:50,252
(grunts)

255
00:19:51,652 --> 00:19:55,012
I haven't got time to watch you play
the big man before your ugly friends.

256
00:19:55,052 --> 00:19:57,052
On Beowulf.

257
00:19:57,332 --> 00:19:59,332
(grunts)

258
00:20:08,172 --> 00:20:10,172
(troll growling)

259
00:20:10,692 --> 00:20:12,212
Huh?

260
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,252
On the smelter.

261
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:17,132
(grunts)

262
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:22,252
(growling)

263
00:20:24,492 --> 00:20:27,372
- Pull me in! (groans)
- The argument with Bayen!

264
00:20:27,412 --> 00:20:30,972
Coin! It was about coin. Talk
to Rheda's steward. Talk to Varr.

265
00:20:31,012 --> 00:20:32,982
- Why?
- I went to Bayen's place, and

266
00:20:33,007 --> 00:20:34,396
Varr was there already.

267
00:20:35,172 --> 00:20:37,172
(growling)

268
00:20:43,412 --> 00:20:45,996
Come on. Time is running out.

269
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:55,132
BRECA: Pleasure doing
business with you, gentlemen.

270
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:57,172
Get back to work!

271
00:20:58,812 --> 00:21:00,812
(troll growling)

272
00:21:05,172 --> 00:21:07,292
Lagrathorn of the Banning.

273
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:09,023
He's been in love with you since you

274
00:21:09,048 --> 00:21:10,212
- were a girl...
- (CHUCKLES)

275
00:21:10,252 --> 00:21:12,412
and he visited Bregan.

276
00:21:12,452 --> 00:21:14,283
You were always jealous of the way

277
00:21:14,308 --> 00:21:16,556
I distracted the boys from your war games.

278
00:21:17,212 --> 00:21:20,092
- I admit it.
- And are you distracted now...

279
00:21:20,132 --> 00:21:22,372
by this lover of yours back in Bregan?

280
00:21:23,572 --> 00:21:25,572
An older sister knows everything.

281
00:21:26,292 --> 00:21:29,870
She must be doing something
for you. You smile more.

282
00:21:30,572 --> 00:21:33,171
Rheda. Abrecan.

283
00:21:35,292 --> 00:21:40,092
Lagrathorn. It's been too
long. How are the forests?

284
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:44,092
Full of trees. You could have waited
for me by the fireside in Herot.

285
00:21:44,132 --> 00:21:48,634
My sister wanted to be sure she
could count on the Banning vote.

286
00:21:50,292 --> 00:21:52,292
Now, if you'd excuse me...

287
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,772
Well?

288
00:21:58,012 --> 00:22:00,692
We've been raided this summer.

289
00:22:00,732 --> 00:22:04,372
Some of my people say Herot has
not done enough to protect us.

290
00:22:04,972 --> 00:22:08,292
And the price of your iron
always goes up and never down.

291
00:22:09,732 --> 00:22:13,090
Now that's out of the way,
what price for your vote?

292
00:22:14,412 --> 00:22:16,412
Everything that was your husband's.

293
00:22:16,452 --> 00:22:18,241
The fireplace in his hall to warm

294
00:22:18,266 --> 00:22:20,476
his feet against, and you to warm my bed.

295
00:22:21,892 --> 00:22:23,892
Riders!

296
00:22:31,252 --> 00:22:33,252
Rate of the Varni.

297
00:22:42,252 --> 00:22:44,252
Rheda...

298
00:22:44,852 --> 00:22:46,892
Making new friends?

299
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:48,932
Learning more about some old ones.

300
00:22:50,252 --> 00:22:52,252
Shall we... ?

301
00:23:04,892 --> 00:23:06,892
Lagrathorn...

302
00:23:15,892 --> 00:23:18,249
Now, assuming you asked Rheda to marry you

303
00:23:18,274 --> 00:23:20,332
and she politely avoided answering...

304
00:23:20,372 --> 00:23:22,492
what can she really do for the Banning?

305
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:29,191
So, where's Slean? Sulking
from not being made Thane?

306
00:23:31,092 --> 00:23:33,092
(creaking)

307
00:23:52,012 --> 00:23:54,012
Scorann?

308
00:23:54,652 --> 00:23:56,652
Scorann!

309
00:24:01,052 --> 00:24:03,452
Come on! The Thanes will be here soon.

310
00:24:03,492 --> 00:24:05,492
Varr...

311
00:24:06,932 --> 00:24:09,052
- What do you want?
- That can wait.

312
00:24:11,652 --> 00:24:15,839
The Thanes are already late.
There's still work to be done.

313
00:24:16,612 --> 00:24:18,612
It can wait.

314
00:24:22,532 --> 00:24:25,212
The alliance must be led by a warrior.

315
00:24:25,252 --> 00:24:27,092
Its purpose is war.

316
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:30,492
It's purpose is to hold the peace.

317
00:24:30,532 --> 00:24:33,492
Something its leader must understand.

318
00:24:33,532 --> 00:24:36,003
I know it's difficult for you to back down

319
00:24:36,028 --> 00:24:38,532
now, having voiced your opinion so openly.

320
00:24:38,572 --> 00:24:41,012
What if I created a new post?

321
00:24:41,052 --> 00:24:43,412
Something suitable for a great warrior?

322
00:24:43,452 --> 00:24:47,052
Say... 'advisor on all matters military'.

323
00:24:47,092 --> 00:24:49,092
(chuckles)

324
00:24:51,132 --> 00:24:53,612
You think that's who I am?

325
00:24:53,652 --> 00:24:55,652
That I can be bought off with a title?

326
00:24:56,652 --> 00:24:59,492
Humans cannot live in
peace alongside the Mudborn,

327
00:24:59,532 --> 00:25:03,332
and if we try, we'll all suffer
the fate of the lost tribe.

328
00:25:03,892 --> 00:25:06,572
The Mere people were
slaughtered 20 summers ago,

329
00:25:06,612 --> 00:25:09,332
precisely because they
provoked the Mudborn...

330
00:25:09,372 --> 00:25:12,932
I'll see you don't get the
majority you need at the Gathering.

331
00:25:12,972 --> 00:25:15,532
Then I'll challenge you
to hand-to-hand combat.

332
00:25:15,572 --> 00:25:19,492
You'll step aside. I'll become
Jarl and lead the alliance.

333
00:25:19,532 --> 00:25:21,132
Huh!

334
00:25:21,172 --> 00:25:23,172
That is how it shall be.

335
00:25:24,412 --> 00:25:28,892
I would rather die by your blade
than step aside and let you be Jarl.

336
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:33,612
Well, if you're dead...

337
00:25:33,652 --> 00:25:36,732
you won't be needing that
golden hall of yours, either.

338
00:25:39,732 --> 00:25:43,012
After you greeted the Varni
messenger, where did you go?

339
00:25:43,052 --> 00:25:45,012
Need to ask?

340
00:25:45,052 --> 00:25:46,972
This hall doesn't run itself.

341
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:50,732
Tarn claims you were with
Bayen late on the night he died.

342
00:25:50,772 --> 00:25:54,452
I'm the steward of Rheda's
household. He was her Reeve.

343
00:25:54,492 --> 00:25:56,572
You want to know if I killed him?

344
00:25:56,612 --> 00:26:00,652
And the Varni messenger.
I'm your Skinshifter.

345
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:02,292
You could have just asked.

346
00:26:02,332 --> 00:26:04,772
He'd lie.

347
00:26:04,812 --> 00:26:07,492
I'm not only outnumbered, but outwitted.

348
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:09,532
Make him put his hand in there.

349
00:26:10,932 --> 00:26:12,492
In the fire.

350
00:26:12,532 --> 00:26:14,572
A Skinshifter can't be burnt.

351
00:26:15,492 --> 00:26:17,652
You didn't think to mention this before?

352
00:26:17,692 --> 00:26:19,692
It didn't seem relevant.

353
00:26:20,132 --> 00:26:22,532
Not directly.

354
00:26:22,572 --> 00:26:24,572
I heard the same thing.

355
00:26:29,172 --> 00:26:31,172
(groans)

356
00:26:35,132 --> 00:26:37,092
Varr...

357
00:26:37,132 --> 00:26:40,092
No need to apologise. It was my choice.

358
00:26:45,972 --> 00:26:49,852
What now? Burn everyone in
order to find this thing?

359
00:26:49,892 --> 00:26:52,212
If we have to.

360
00:26:52,252 --> 00:26:54,252
VISHKA: Beowulf...

361
00:27:02,492 --> 00:27:04,812
You wanted to know who I repaired this for.

362
00:27:06,852 --> 00:27:08,852
Elvina.

363
00:27:20,852 --> 00:27:22,852
(crow screeching)

364
00:27:44,123 --> 00:27:46,123
Scorann.

365
00:27:48,603 --> 00:27:50,123
(man shouting)

366
00:27:50,163 --> 00:27:52,283
Move! Now.

367
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:09,083
Split up!

368
00:28:12,603 --> 00:28:14,603
(groans)

369
00:28:18,923 --> 00:28:20,883
MAN: Where are they?

370
00:28:20,923 --> 00:28:23,283
- Who are they?
- Brigands.

371
00:28:23,923 --> 00:28:28,323
Caught us on the North Road. Must be
after ransom. Are you alone?

372
00:28:33,123 --> 00:28:35,363
I'm sorry to hear about Hrothgar.

373
00:28:35,403 --> 00:28:38,363
Your father was... (chuckles)

374
00:28:39,123 --> 00:28:41,043
I'm not sorry at all.

375
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:43,285
I've hated him ever since
he tricked me into

376
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:45,683
taking that Wisdeth bride
to bind his alliance.

377
00:28:45,723 --> 00:28:47,883
I told him so to his face. A Varni,

378
00:28:47,908 --> 00:28:50,523
married to a big-boned farmer's daughter?

379
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:53,883
I've been a walking, talking
dead man for 15 years.

380
00:28:53,923 --> 00:28:55,963
- What are you doing here?
- Do I need a reason

381
00:28:56,003 --> 00:28:58,843
to meet the only man who told
my father what he thought of him?

382
00:28:58,883 --> 00:29:01,523
- Yes, if it concerns your mother.
- She needs your vote.

383
00:29:01,563 --> 00:29:04,163
- (screaming)
- What is that?

384
00:29:04,203 --> 00:29:07,963
They must have taken my man alive.
He risked his life to save me.

385
00:29:08,003 --> 00:29:10,563
If it's ransom they want,
you're the prize, not him.

386
00:29:10,603 --> 00:29:13,043
They think you'll hand
yourself in to save him.

387
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:15,083
I wouldn't want to disappoint them.

388
00:29:24,403 --> 00:29:26,403
(gasps)

389
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:30,403
You should have come in,
made yourself at home.

390
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:38,443
The clasp is mine.

391
00:29:39,443 --> 00:29:43,283
It was used to murder
Bayen and a Varni messenger.

392
00:29:44,363 --> 00:29:47,403
The killer was Mudborn. A Skinshifter.

393
00:29:50,563 --> 00:29:52,563
Who are your people?

394
00:29:53,323 --> 00:29:55,323
Wanderers.

395
00:29:57,283 --> 00:30:01,123
People of the Mere, the few that
escaped the slaughter in the Marshes.

396
00:30:02,683 --> 00:30:05,403
How did you come by a
Banning warrior's clasp?

397
00:30:05,443 --> 00:30:07,523
It was a gift to my father.

398
00:30:07,563 --> 00:30:09,563
I lost it at the feast.

399
00:30:10,083 --> 00:30:12,083
You can't think it's me.

400
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:16,563
The Skinshifter can't be burnt.

401
00:30:17,643 --> 00:30:19,803
And it's wounded.

402
00:30:27,163 --> 00:30:29,163
Then I'll show you I have no wound.

403
00:30:45,163 --> 00:30:47,163
Enough.

404
00:31:25,763 --> 00:31:27,763
(footsteps)

405
00:31:31,603 --> 00:31:33,603
(thud)

406
00:31:41,683 --> 00:31:43,683
Show yourself!

407
00:31:45,563 --> 00:31:47,563
(snarling)

408
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:52,083
(roaring)

409
00:31:52,723 --> 00:31:54,723
(groans)

410
00:31:57,243 --> 00:31:59,243
(roars)

411
00:32:04,843 --> 00:32:06,843
(roars in pain)

412
00:32:09,403 --> 00:32:11,403
(grunts)

413
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:13,923
It's a Skinshifter!

414
00:32:13,963 --> 00:32:15,963
(screaming)

415
00:32:16,803 --> 00:32:18,803
There it is!

416
00:32:20,363 --> 00:32:22,363
(roars)

417
00:32:26,203 --> 00:32:28,243
(shouting)

418
00:32:28,283 --> 00:32:30,283
Move! Move!

419
00:32:30,763 --> 00:32:32,763
(gasps)

420
00:32:38,043 --> 00:32:40,083
Get away! Get away!

421
00:32:44,603 --> 00:32:47,083
- Move!
- Did you see it?

422
00:32:47,123 --> 00:32:49,123
MAN: Where's it gone?

423
00:33:30,283 --> 00:33:32,643
Tarn?

424
00:33:32,683 --> 00:33:34,443
Are you sure it's him?

425
00:33:34,483 --> 00:33:36,843
He has the wound I gave him. And another.

426
00:33:39,243 --> 00:33:41,243
That Bayen gave him.

427
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:49,483
That's it? You found the
Skinshifter? Are you sure?

428
00:33:49,523 --> 00:33:52,243
- We have to get it out of here.
- Huh!

429
00:33:53,003 --> 00:33:54,583
Do you want to explain to the smelters

430
00:33:54,584 --> 00:33:57,107
that their leader is a Skinshifter?

431
00:34:05,163 --> 00:34:07,163
(horn blaring)

432
00:34:08,123 --> 00:34:10,123
- The Thanes.
- Come on!

433
00:34:10,842 --> 00:34:12,842
We need to hide the body.

434
00:34:16,643 --> 00:34:18,643
Quickly. They're coming.

435
00:34:28,362 --> 00:34:30,362
(grunts)

436
00:34:34,683 --> 00:34:37,483
- (panting)
- Shhh.

437
00:34:40,003 --> 00:34:42,003
I heard it breathe.

438
00:34:43,043 --> 00:34:45,483
It's air escaping the body.

439
00:34:49,322 --> 00:34:53,563
When I was a boy, my mother used
to tell stories about Skinshifters.

440
00:34:54,163 --> 00:34:57,963
Horrible, horrible stories.

441
00:34:59,683 --> 00:35:01,683
At least, I think she was my mother.

442
00:35:04,563 --> 00:35:06,563
I didn't know her well.

443
00:35:20,843 --> 00:35:22,843
Summon Beowulf.

444
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:28,923
My son - has he returned?

445
00:35:29,483 --> 00:35:31,483
Not yet.

446
00:35:38,643 --> 00:35:40,643
(man screaming)

447
00:35:45,203 --> 00:35:47,203
Axel!

448
00:35:47,883 --> 00:35:51,963
Let my man go... and you can have me.

449
00:35:52,003 --> 00:35:55,123
We'll have you, anyway! Take him!

450
00:35:55,163 --> 00:35:57,163
(men shouting)

451
00:35:57,803 --> 00:35:59,803
(screaming)

452
00:36:00,923 --> 00:36:02,923
(groans)

453
00:36:06,203 --> 00:36:08,203
Wait!

454
00:36:13,243 --> 00:36:16,043
Catch him and cut him to pieces, boys!

455
00:36:19,323 --> 00:36:22,483
Leave that one. Don't you smell the coin?

456
00:36:31,683 --> 00:36:34,403
- Run!
- Do that and this one's dead!

457
00:36:44,352 --> 00:36:46,352
(sighs)

458
00:37:15,272 --> 00:37:17,272
(talking softly)

459
00:37:18,952 --> 00:37:21,619
His man's missing, and
if he doesn't know there's

460
00:37:21,644 --> 00:37:23,936
a Skinshifter on the loose, he will soon.

461
00:37:25,472 --> 00:37:28,792
- You found it?
- And killed it. Rheda...

462
00:37:28,832 --> 00:37:30,832
Rate...

463
00:37:30,872 --> 00:37:33,152
I'm sorry, but your shieldsman is dead.

464
00:37:33,792 --> 00:37:36,272
He laid down his life to save mine.

465
00:37:36,992 --> 00:37:38,752
Who killed him?

466
00:37:38,792 --> 00:37:42,792
Not who, but what. A Skinshifter.

467
00:37:42,832 --> 00:37:44,832
- Where is it?
- No!

468
00:37:45,872 --> 00:37:48,152
Rheda, let us be clear.

469
00:37:48,192 --> 00:37:51,032
You are telling us that the
most reviled of all our enemies

470
00:37:51,072 --> 00:37:53,992
is running loose in Herot?

471
00:37:54,032 --> 00:37:57,232
As soon as it was discovered,
I had it hunted down and killed.

472
00:37:58,232 --> 00:38:00,752
I favour peace...

473
00:38:00,792 --> 00:38:02,712
but if we have enemies,

474
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:04,832
they will be struck down without mercy.

475
00:38:06,912 --> 00:38:08,912
Show us the body.

476
00:38:10,072 --> 00:38:12,072
Bring it.

477
00:38:15,592 --> 00:38:17,592
It's in human form.

478
00:38:18,152 --> 00:38:21,272
There's no way of proving
it's the Skinshifter.

479
00:38:21,312 --> 00:38:23,312
Well, find a way.

480
00:38:44,272 --> 00:38:47,272
- You murdered Tarn!
- He was a Skinshifter.

481
00:38:47,312 --> 00:38:50,232
Tarn was a man! I'm his mother.

482
00:38:52,112 --> 00:38:54,112
Koll...

483
00:38:56,112 --> 00:39:00,352
My son wasn't the best
of men, but he was a man.

484
00:39:15,432 --> 00:39:17,432
(grunts)

485
00:39:21,672 --> 00:39:24,352
- It's you! You killed them.
- I had no choice,

486
00:39:24,392 --> 00:39:26,392
but to protect my family.

487
00:39:30,672 --> 00:39:32,672
It's not Tarn!

488
00:39:36,632 --> 00:39:38,632
The doors!

489
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:42,712
Close the doors!

490
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:48,752
(roars)

491
00:39:48,792 --> 00:39:50,912
(clattering)

492
00:39:50,952 --> 00:39:52,952
See what that is.

493
00:39:54,872 --> 00:39:56,872
Let us all see.

494
00:39:58,792 --> 00:40:00,792
(growling)

495
00:40:03,792 --> 00:40:05,792
(roars)

496
00:40:08,872 --> 00:40:10,872
(groans)

497
00:40:13,672 --> 00:40:15,672
(roars)

498
00:40:18,152 --> 00:40:20,152
(panting)

499
00:40:33,432 --> 00:40:35,432
Koll.

500
00:40:37,112 --> 00:40:39,432
(pulls out sword)

501
00:40:39,472 --> 00:40:42,912
- Stand aside.
- That thing killed Argat's brother.

502
00:40:42,952 --> 00:40:44,952
And Herot's Reeve!

503
00:40:46,192 --> 00:40:48,678
When the time comes,
we'll toss a coin for the

504
00:40:48,703 --> 00:40:51,136
pleasure of cutting
its throat, but not yet.

505
00:40:54,112 --> 00:40:56,952
I believe the Skinshifter was
acting on someone else's part.

506
00:40:56,992 --> 00:41:00,032
Kill it, and we may never know who.

507
00:41:00,072 --> 00:41:02,072
What makes you say that?

508
00:41:03,072 --> 00:41:04,992
It said as much.

509
00:41:05,032 --> 00:41:07,752
And it used this to do its killing.

510
00:41:09,312 --> 00:41:11,432
Left it in the dead Varni, to be found.

511
00:41:11,472 --> 00:41:15,472
- A Banning clasp.
- This wasn't about Bayen or the Varni.

512
00:41:16,592 --> 00:41:20,032
It was about killing your Reeve
and stirring up the tribes.

513
00:41:21,072 --> 00:41:23,792
To make my sister look
weak before the Gathering.

514
00:41:24,432 --> 00:41:26,432
(grunts)

515
00:41:43,352 --> 00:41:47,352
It makes no sense. He was
a loving husband, father.

516
00:41:47,392 --> 00:41:50,072
He lived here in peace for
years. He was a good man.

517
00:41:50,112 --> 00:41:52,712
Man? This thing was a murderer of men.

518
00:41:52,752 --> 00:41:55,392
Amongst them, Bayen,
who it called a friend.

519
00:41:55,432 --> 00:41:58,912
All Mudborn are killers.
It's in their blood.

520
00:41:58,952 --> 00:42:00,952
And what's in yours?

521
00:42:10,672 --> 00:42:15,352
Mmm. My wife... can cook. Try.

522
00:42:17,272 --> 00:42:20,472
Hey... we did a good job today.

523
00:42:20,512 --> 00:42:22,632
We?

524
00:42:22,672 --> 00:42:25,032
I was there, too.

525
00:42:25,072 --> 00:42:27,072
Hey...

526
00:42:27,552 --> 00:42:29,552
Get your own wife.

527
00:42:30,712 --> 00:42:32,712
(gasps)

528
00:42:38,032 --> 00:42:40,032
(horse neighing)

529
00:42:42,872 --> 00:42:45,112
Whoa. Easy.

530
00:42:45,152 --> 00:42:47,392
(neighing)

531
00:42:47,432 --> 00:42:49,472
Easy. Easy. Shhh.

532
00:42:50,232 --> 00:42:52,232
Easy, boy.

533
00:42:56,592 --> 00:42:58,592
That's Slean's horse.

534
00:43:02,312 --> 00:43:04,312
My son.

535
00:43:08,472 --> 00:43:10,192
They will find Slean.

536
00:43:10,232 --> 00:43:13,832
Rate and Beowulf are looking for
him now. There are no finer warriors.

537
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:18,192
- What is he?
- A filthy Mudborn!

538
00:43:18,232 --> 00:43:21,272
If Scorann doesn't arrive,
your future is in my hands.

539
00:43:21,312 --> 00:43:23,312
- People don't want justice.
- (roars)

540
00:43:23,352 --> 00:43:24,912
They want to see strength.

541
00:43:24,952 --> 00:43:27,487
I was born a warrior, and I'll die one.

542
