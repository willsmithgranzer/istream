332
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,720
Before my time.

333
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:54,640
I heard giants ate human babies.

334
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,040
- Wives' tales.
- You're not scared?

335
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:04,320
- (STONES FALLING)
- What was that?

336
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,800
Come on.

337
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,710
Do you smell that?

338
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,080
(BEAST PURRING)

339
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,200
(SNARLING)

340
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,880
Don't move.

341
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,840
Elvina!

342
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,920
(SHRIEKS)

343
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,580
Hey! Hey!

344
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,280
Look out!

345
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,360
Agh!

346
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,720
Yaaagh!

347
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,640
(SHRIEKS)

348
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,320
How is he?!

349
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,040
Doubt I'll see morning.

350
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,630
He'll live.

351
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,000
Lila? My widow.

352
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:21,680
Your husband believes every
cloud has a darker one behind it.

353
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,060
There's nothing more you can do here.

354
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,800
There. Can you?

355
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,150
- Where are you going?
- Bayen's body must be prepared.

356
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,670
He's dead. What about me?

357
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,880
Aw. (GROANS)

358
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,510
Cut from the mud-born that killed Bayen.

359
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,040
Not from any I've seen.

360
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:53,120
Before it came here, the beast had been
slaughtering crofters on the Northern Road.

361
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,600
A pretty story. But it proves nothing.

362
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,710
Beowulf saved Elvina's
life and returned here.

363
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,750
That proves something.

364
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,200
Only that he wants her.

365
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,600
You may look upon Hrothgar's body.

366
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,360
Then you will go.

367
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,760
(DOG BARKING)

368
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:36,070
It should've been me that saved you.

369
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,750
You already have. Many times.

370
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,030
I'd have cut the beast's head off.

371
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,750
Then I'm glad it wasn't you.

372
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,960
See you tonight?

373
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,320
Did you find the rosewater?

374
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,680
Let me help.

375
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,960
What is it?

376
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,270
Worried I might steal something?

377
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,590
If you did, I'd know.

378
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,480
There are no secrets
from me within this hall.

379
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,560
Beowulf.

380
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:12,400
This hall will always
be your home, Beowulf.

381
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,400
Slean is your half-brother.

382
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,440
You're all my blood.

383
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,160
My son.

384
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,640
Nobody else knows.

385
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,700
You don't belong here.

386
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,160
Never did.

387
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,400
HROTHGAR: 'Heorot will need you.'

388
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,400
Your brother will need you.

389
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,800
'And you will come.'

390
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,080
- What will you do now?
- Finish what I started.

391
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,110
- Kill the mud-born.
- It wasn't the beast that killed Bayen.

392
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:35,640
- How do you know? - The wound wasn't
inflicted by a beast. He was stabbed.

393
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,670
- Bayen had enemies here?
- He was Hrothgar's reeve.

394
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:43,080
Mine, too. All of
Heorot's enemies were his.

395
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,030
And there are many.

396
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,550
Even in a time of peace.

397
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:52,160
Well, whoever it was, I'll find them...

398
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,110
and kill them.

399
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,670
It's a skin-shifter!

400
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,190
People fear skin-shifters
more than other mud-born

401
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,630
Because they can live
amongst us undetected.

402
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,110
If word gets out, there will be panic.

403
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:08,470
- Can you find the thing and kill it?
- If it's still here.

404
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,270
I've been a walking, talking
dead man for 15 years.

405
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,310
- Why are you here?
- The killer was mud-born.

406
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,360
You can't think it's me.

407
00:44:16,305 --> 00:44:22,285
