You could be one and I the other.

He asked I stand for him at
Slean's union with Keela.

And so you are my sister.

and look after your
interests during the rituals.

And you'll attend your
binding of friends and kin.

27
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,160
- I have no kin here.
- My mother and others will join you.

28
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,920
Then tomorrow we'll meet at the grey
stones for the truth telling.

And after that, it's all over with.

30

Keela, this is Saray from Bregan.

31

- You know my son.
- Your bride is beautiful.

32
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,720
Thank you. If you'll excuse me.

33

Rheda, must I be guarded all the time?

34
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,320
Your marriage to my son must go ahead

35
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,760
or your father will
revoke his support for me

36
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,040
and the other Thanes will question
my right to be Jarl of the Shieldlands.

37

I don't really understand such things.

38

But I do know that I must marry Slean.

39

167
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,200
Argh!

168
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,040
What are you doing? I have to do this.

169
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,120
This is what you want. If
she dies, you'll be Thane.

170
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,240
This was never planned.

171
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,400
She's innocent to all this.

172
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,880
Tell my uncle I am done with him.

173
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,440
Go.

174
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,480
Go!

175
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,520
Get out!

176
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,560
Are you all right?

177
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,320
She tried to kill me.

178
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,280
You let her go.

179
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,000
- We must go back.
- No.

180
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,120
We aren't done here.

181
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,880
Don't you understand?

182
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,400
I've betrayed my mother, I've
plotted with my uncle.

183
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,160
That woman was sent here to kill you!

184
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,880
But you saved me.

185
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,920
Why?

186
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,960
I don't know.

187
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,080
You have no part in any of
this, you're just a piece being moved

188
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,360
in a game of which
you have no understanding.

189
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,200
Don't I?

190
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,880
I killed my sister.

191
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,960
She is the one who
should have been with you today.

192
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,720
Even as the world turned to
dust, Mara had everything.

193
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,320
People loved he because she was kind.

194
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,119
My father loved her because
she was first.

195
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,359
And she had Rowan.

196
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,680
And then...

197
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,599
the chance to escape.

198
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,920
To never feel hunger.

199
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,960
Or fear.

200
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
To need for nothing.

201
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,800
She died of a fever.

202
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,400
She was recovering.

203
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,200
I poisoned her.

204
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,440
(CHUCKLES)

205
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,440
Slean, I will never breathe
a word of what you have done,

206
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,000
of what happened here today.

207
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,320
Walk away.

208
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,720
I owe you my life, you owe me nothing.

209
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,320
Or stay.

210
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,080
I can't.

211
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,960
Because you love Elvina?

212
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,760
(LAUGHS BITTERLY)

I know, but she is Beowulf's.

00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,120
He came to her bed last night.

215
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,240
We don't choose who we love.

216
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,640
Or who loves us.

217
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,680
But we can choose who we make our
way through this world with.

218
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,880
Light the fire with me.

219
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,640
You wish to be Thane?

220
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,600
I can help you.

221
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:04,560
Against whoever stands in your way.

222
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,240
(HORN SOUNDS)

223

They can't take it
away from you now, Rheda.

224
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,000
With this marriage, you
are Jarl of the Shieldlands.

225
00:19:53,953 --> 00:19:59,113
These laws of the Jarl are
to be obeyed by all tribes.

226
00:19:59,153 --> 00:20:02,553
The life of a murderer will be forfeit,

227
00:20:02,593 --> 00:20:04,873
unless blood money is paid.

228
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:07,833
A common thief will
be branded and cast out.

229
00:20:09,593 --> 00:20:12,473
Fixed prices on all
goods traded in the Shieldlands

230
00:20:12,513 --> 00:20:14,193
will be set by the Jarl.

(CROWD MOAN)

232
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:20,353
What right does she have
to set the price of fish?

233
00:20:20,393 --> 00:20:24,073
It is us who risk our lives
each summer to catch the pandiri.

234
00:20:24,113 --> 00:20:26,553
You should have told
me about these laws.

235
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:30,073
You were where your people needed
you the most... at the watch.

236
00:20:30,113 --> 00:20:32,113
I could not disrupt you.

237
00:20:32,153 --> 00:20:34,393
You were distracted enough.

238
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,433
Meaning?

239
00:20:36,473 --> 00:20:39,233
You need a clear
mind to see the pandiri.

240
00:20:39,273 --> 00:20:41,713
However, yours is with matters in Herot.

241
00:20:41,753 --> 00:20:44,313
When it should be here, with the sea.

242
00:20:44,353 --> 00:20:47,193
Abrecan, look around.

243
00:20:47,233 --> 00:20:50,033
Your people are nervous.

244
00:20:50,073 --> 00:20:53,713
The pandiri are late. Some
think you missed them again.

245
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,753
Is that what you think?

246
00:20:55,793 --> 00:20:57,793
No.

247
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:03,073
But if you fail, Bregan will
have another poor, hungry winter.

248
00:21:03,113 --> 00:21:05,513
And your people will be unforgiving.

249
00:21:05,553 --> 00:21:07,833
The council will elect a new Thane.

250
00:21:11,393 --> 00:21:14,753
Go back to the watch. Your
people are relying on you.

251
00:21:14,793 --> 00:21:16,793
Forget Herot.

Hey!

Get him out of here.

We're headhunters.

Breca's wanted for murder, you know it.

- I'm the law here.

I'll do it!

Stop, wait! Do that here without any
explanation and we're all dead.

- The boy's name is Kye.
- Yeah, I know his face.

264
00:22:44,793 --> 00:22:47,873
He hired us to bring Breca to
law after he escaped the noose.

265
00:22:47,913 --> 00:22:50,553
If that's so, why try to
snatch him away, why not just ask?

266

(LAUGHS) Ask the man who helped
him escape the first time?

You're the Reeve here now,
Beowulf, and protector of these good people.

268
00:22:59,153 --> 00:23:01,913
So we'll overlook that.

269

ask this man to be put to trial

Herot could be moving
against our gates as we speak!

When did we become the
killer of young women?

What do you mean by that?

We need a strong leader at the
heart of the Shieldlands,

That's what he does... seeks
out widows he thinks have coin

I knew Breca had killed a man,

Hey there.

491
00:41:05,832 --> 00:41:07,832
(STABS HIM) Argh!

492
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:21,872
I didn't need your help!

493
00:41:23,832 --> 00:41:25,832
Clearly.

494
00:41:25,872 --> 00:41:28,712
He made my mother sleep with him.

495
00:41:32,392 --> 00:41:35,432
Because she didn't have
enough money to save you!

496
00:41:37,232 --> 00:41:40,352
She told me after you left,

497
00:41:40,392 --> 00:41:43,592
so it was my right to kill him!

498
00:41:43,632 --> 00:41:45,632
(SNIFFS)

499
00:41:45,672 --> 00:41:49,112
Be thankful you didn't kill him, Vishka.

500
00:41:49,152 --> 00:41:56,264
Blood on your hands is hard to wash off.

501
00:41:56,352 --> 00:41:58,352
(SNIFFS)

502
00:42:18,552 --> 00:42:22,312
The bridge is out. It's over.

503
00:42:22,352 --> 00:42:24,832
Without the nets in
place, the catch will be lost.

504
00:42:28,752 --> 00:42:31,392
No, it's not.

505
00:42:37,152 --> 00:42:39,152
Be ready.

506
00:42:42,152 --> 00:42:44,152
Abrecan, no!

507
00:42:44,192 --> 00:42:46,192
Hold that rope steady.

508
00:42:47,632 --> 00:42:49,632
Quickly, they'll eat you alive!

509
00:42:52,352 --> 00:42:56,232
Pandiri, pandiri!

510
00:42:56,272 --> 00:42:58,432
Abrecan, hurry!

511
00:42:58,472 --> 00:43:00,472
They're here!

512
00:43:00,512 --> 00:43:02,512
Pandiri, pandiri!

513
00:43:09,112 --> 00:43:11,432
Right, give him
slack. Quickly, everybody!

514
00:43:11,472 --> 00:43:13,472
Keep going!

515
00:43:32,792 --> 00:43:34,792
Hold it tight!

516
00:43:42,992 --> 00:43:45,192
Now tighten it up! Pull!

517
00:43:47,672 --> 00:43:49,672
(ROARS)

518
00:44:04,712 --> 00:44:10,232
Look at this. A catch
they will sing songs about.

519
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:13,992
- (CHEER)
- A catch you brought in.

520
00:44:14,032 --> 00:44:17,672
For those of you who
followed and believed,

521
00:44:17,712 --> 00:44:19,832
I thank you.

522
00:44:21,472 --> 00:44:24,112
And for those of you who didn't,

523
00:44:24,152 --> 00:44:28,792
I am here to tell
you I am Bregan's Thane!

524
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:31,072
- (CHEER)
- I have a vision for us.

525
00:44:31,112 --> 00:44:35,072
To be the greatest
tribe in all the Shieldlands!

526
00:44:35,112 --> 00:44:41,712
Who won't follow laws set down by
a Jarl who can barely lift a sword.

527
00:44:41,752 --> 00:44:45,872
But to do this, I need you

528
00:44:45,912 --> 00:44:48,392
to help me, to follow me,

529
00:44:48,432 --> 00:44:52,072
to fight with me, to battle with Herot.

530
00:44:55,552 --> 00:44:58,072
- Who is with me?
- (CHEER)

531
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,992
- Who will follow me?
- (CHEER)

532
00:45:00,032 --> 00:45:03,472
- Who will fight for me?
- (CHEER)

533
00:45:03,512 --> 00:45:08,133
CROWD: Abrecan, Abrecan, Abrecan!

534
00:45:10,912 --> 00:45:14,312
I need to warn Beowulf.

535
00:45:17,752 --> 00:45:19,752
(CHEERS)

536
00:45:28,912 --> 00:45:30,912
Bregan!

537
00:45:34,032 --> 00:45:36,512
I told her not to go
alone. It's dangerous out there.

538
00:45:36,552 --> 00:45:38,432
Elvina!

539
00:45:38,472 --> 00:45:40,152
Where did you find it?

540
00:45:40,192 --> 00:45:42,112
With two others, in
the woods to the east.

541
00:45:42,152 --> 00:45:43,872
(SNARLS)

542
00:45:43,912 --> 00:45:45,632
Elvina!

543
00:45:45,672 --> 00:45:49,032
The war bands are coming together.

544
00:45:49,072 --> 00:45:53,592
This time, they mean to
destroy us. All of us.

545
00:45:53,632 --> 00:45:55,344
Beowulf!

546
00:45:56,305 --> 00:46:02,408
