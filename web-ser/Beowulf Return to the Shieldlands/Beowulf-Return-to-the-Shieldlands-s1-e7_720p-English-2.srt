I hear the Warig are
causing your father some concern.

They killed my
mother, slaughtered our people

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,040
- and no-one came to our aid.
- We're not prepared for an attack.

00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,120
There used to be a

Someone is cutting the salts so the

All the salt in Heorot has
been sent to the mining camps.

Well, that should hold them off
till I get back from Bregan with more.

It would suit the Varni very well

if the miners suddenly
needed their protection.

for the miners to rethink

and take their ore elsewhere.

them of me was good and true

00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,040
but that man would never
have allowed the Wulfings

- to go against his own sister.

happen much? That the fight.

fight him and walk free after.

We've just been talking about you.

320
00:27:32,994 --> 00:27:37,554
Hane thinks you're a spy sent
from Heorot by my sister.

321
00:27:37,594 --> 00:27:40,074
I told you he didn't think well of me.

322
00:27:42,154 --> 00:27:44,634
- I'm not a spy, Hane.
- No.

323
00:27:46,074 --> 00:27:48,074
You're a merchant's daughter.

324
00:27:52,674 --> 00:27:56,034
No. Not that either.

325
00:27:58,874 --> 00:28:01,074
Although, I never knew my parents...

326
00:28:02,074 --> 00:28:04,074
so perhaps it's true.

327
00:28:05,874 --> 00:28:08,274
Orphans make the best assassins.

328
00:28:09,634 --> 00:28:13,274
No family. No ties.

329
00:28:13,314 --> 00:28:16,314
And no-one ever suspects...

330
00:28:16,354 --> 00:28:18,354
until it's too late.

331
00:28:19,874 --> 00:28:21,033
You were hired to kill.

332
00:28:21,058 --> 00:28:22,394
- Never ask questions.
- Who?

333
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:24,994
Just get close.

334
00:28:25,034 --> 00:28:28,634
With Abrecan... I got too close

335
00:28:28,674 --> 00:28:32,234
- and then I couldn't.
- Who hired you to kill him?!

336
00:28:32,274 --> 00:28:33,954
A man you never meet again.

337
00:28:33,994 --> 00:28:36,514
Gives you the money and
tells you your target.

338
00:28:36,554 --> 00:28:38,954
If whoever it was finds
me, they'll kill me.

339
00:28:40,554 --> 00:28:42,674
They'll have to come through me first.

340
00:28:45,314 --> 00:28:47,314
So now you know.

341
00:29:26,674 --> 00:29:29,514
Walk slow... and sure.

342
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,234
We'll meet again.

343
00:29:40,274 --> 00:29:43,114
But you'll not know it until
my blade is in you.

344
00:29:44,794 --> 00:29:47,954
Did you practise that? Almost
sounded convincing.

You would risk your life for this girl?

352
00:31:09,472 --> 00:31:12,952
She's not just a girl. She's
to be married to Rheda's son.

353
00:31:12,992 --> 00:31:15,432
She's worth more to them than any gold.

354
00:31:17,872 --> 00:31:20,512
And taking her is our revenge.

Ride.

357
00:31:34,632 --> 00:31:36,832
They dismounted. Came by the river.

358
00:31:36,872 --> 00:31:40,152
- To throw us off.
- Then we follow.

359
00:31:44,512 --> 00:31:47,992
Here. What good are you gonna
be in a fight without a weapon?

360
00:31:48,952 --> 00:31:50,952
I realised a long time back,

361
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:53,632
the best weapon... is to think faster.

362
00:31:55,312 --> 00:31:58,592
- More Varni training.
- More a desire to live.

363
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,752
They're heading for the estuary.

364
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:06,072
Let us hope the people of Heorot

365
00:32:06,112 --> 00:32:08,512
are not burning their
victims as we do here.

366
00:32:10,032 --> 00:32:12,752
Why didn't you warn
them about the Wulfings?

367
00:32:13,752 --> 00:32:16,832
And of course, there's still the
matter of the sword as well.

368
00:32:16,872 --> 00:32:21,432
They must have noticed by
now. What do you want me to do?

369
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:29,112
Find the Wulfing ship.

370
00:32:31,912 --> 00:32:34,072
Give word when they set sail.

371
00:32:34,112 --> 00:32:36,952
We want to be sure Bregan is safe.

372
00:32:36,992 --> 00:32:39,552
I'll handle Heorot's questions myself.

Vlade.

374

I know your heart is loyal.

She's there!

376
00:33:17,512 --> 00:33:19,512
Where are Jogan and the boy?

377
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:31,632
Keep your eyes open.

378

It doesn't have to be this way.

Why didn't you warn
us about the Wulfings?

There was nothing we could do.

414

They cut through our
guard and... tore down the tower.

415

You didn't send any
men to hunt them down?

I thought they'd sail
home, not go to Heorot.

How do you explain the salt?

418
00:38:19,312 --> 00:38:21,312
It was treachery.

Of that there is no doubt.

He was behind Scorann's kidnap.

425
00:38:45,712 --> 00:38:47,712
I know that now.

426
00:38:48,632 --> 00:38:50,672
And he tampered with the salt supply.

427
00:38:50,712 --> 00:38:53,112
As soon as I
realised, I put him under guard.

428
00:38:53,152 --> 00:38:55,232
I meant to give him up to you...

429
00:38:57,432 --> 00:39:02,712
but he escaped the guard and
then... he escaped his life.

430
00:39:04,872 --> 00:39:09,152
Perhaps the guilt was too
heavy for him to carry.

431

trouble you too long.

You see, I keep my word.
The price of your freedom
