1
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:06,168
You'll go to Mere. Collect my
son's bride. Take Elvina with you.

2
00:00:06,208 --> 00:00:08,368
- Why?
- She knows their ways.

3
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:11,328
My mother wants to drive us apart.
That's why she is sending you.

4
00:00:11,368 --> 00:00:14,088
I've seen you look at
Elvina and her at you.

5
00:00:14,128 --> 00:00:15,808
It's not the way she looks at my son.

6
00:00:15,848 --> 00:00:17,328
- Sand wryms!
- Run!

7
00:00:20,448 --> 00:00:22,695
- You're alive.
- Abrecan is impatient to know if

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,088
you'll help him become
Jarl of the Shieldlands.

9
00:00:25,128 --> 00:00:27,688
She'll not give you what you want. I can.

10
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:30,448
The Warig. Their war
bands are coming together.

11
00:00:33,848 --> 00:00:36,168
This time, they mean to destroy us.

12
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:37,608
All of us.

13
00:00:37,648 --> 00:00:40,288
I have a daughter to bury.

14
00:00:40,328 --> 00:00:42,928
You will release me, so
I can be Slean's bride.

15
00:00:43,488 --> 00:00:46,168
- Does your support for Rheda stand?
- It does.

17
00:00:59,048 --> 00:01:02,368
Aaah!

18
00:01:19,688 --> 00:01:21,888
Aaah! Aaah-ah!

19
00:01:24,728 --> 00:01:26,728
Aaah! Aaah!

20
00:01:36,568 --> 00:01:38,568
Look at you now!

21
00:01:40,248 --> 00:01:44,048
Pig filth, scut for brains! You
should have learned to climb!

22
00:01:49,768 --> 00:01:52,328
Aaah! Aaah! Aaah!

23
00:02:05,888 --> 00:02:07,888
Fixed you, didn't I? Eh?

24
00:02:08,967 --> 00:02:10,967
That'll show you.

25
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:13,008
You and all your kind.

27
00:03:00,368 --> 00:03:02,368
War is coming.

28
00:03:02,408 --> 00:03:04,208
Says who?

29
00:03:04,248 --> 00:03:07,928
Gorrik, Thane of the Mere. He
thinks the Warig are rising up again.

30
00:03:07,968 --> 00:03:10,848
If they do, we go to Mere,
stand with them and fight.

31
00:03:10,888 --> 00:03:14,368
It's not just Mere. We were
attacked by Warig in the Edgelands.

32
00:03:14,408 --> 00:03:17,328
They haven't attacked
farmers there for 20 summers.

33
00:03:18,288 --> 00:03:21,608
If war comes to the Shieldlands,
they'll want to take Herot.

34
00:03:21,648 --> 00:03:23,968
We're not prepared for an attack.

35
00:03:24,008 --> 00:03:28,328
There used to be a stake wall,
guard towers every 40 paces.

36
00:03:28,368 --> 00:03:30,551
Now there's a handful of spars by the

37
00:03:30,576 --> 00:03:32,848
main gate and a few Huskarla standing.

38
00:03:32,888 --> 00:03:34,488
Then fix it!

39
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,528
And bring my new daughter to me.

40
00:03:38,008 --> 00:03:41,088
I agreed to this marriage
to strengthen the tribes.

41
00:03:41,128 --> 00:03:44,888
If war lies ahead, then we'll all
be thankful for it. Even Slean.

42
00:03:46,328 --> 00:03:50,328
So, tell me, this Mara, what's she like?

43
00:03:52,328 --> 00:03:56,488
She died. Sea fever. Elvina
did everything she could.

44
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,528
What?

45
00:04:00,368 --> 00:04:02,888
- This is all for nothing?
- No. Not for nothing.

46
00:04:02,928 --> 00:04:04,728
We have a bride.

47
00:04:04,768 --> 00:04:06,568
Just not Mara.

48
00:04:06,608 --> 00:04:09,408
Her name is Kela, Gorrik's second daughter.

49
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:33,688
Are you so impatient to see your bride?

50
00:04:33,728 --> 00:04:35,528
I'm impatient to see you.

51
00:04:40,128 --> 00:04:43,608
This marriage, it changes
nothing of how I feel for you.

52
00:04:43,648 --> 00:04:45,648
It changes everything.

53
00:04:45,688 --> 00:04:47,488
In form only.

54
00:04:47,528 --> 00:04:50,728
It doesn't change who I
love or who I take to my bed.

55
00:05:28,048 --> 00:05:30,048
She looks after me.

56
00:05:31,128 --> 00:05:33,128
You don't have to be afraid.

57
00:05:34,808 --> 00:05:36,808
Everyone here is your friend.

58
00:05:40,368 --> 00:05:44,008
What does it matter where I was?
I'm back and I've work to do.

59
00:05:45,088 --> 00:05:47,488
- With that arm?
- I told you, it's nothing.

60
00:05:47,528 --> 00:05:49,848
- How will you work like that?
- I'll manage.

61
00:05:51,248 --> 00:05:54,368
- It's just a scratch.
- That 'scratch' came from an arrow!

62
00:05:56,008 --> 00:05:58,014
She was with you, wasn't she?

63
00:05:58,039 --> 00:05:59,808
- You let her get hurt!
- It wasn't my fault.

64
00:05:59,848 --> 00:06:01,848
- She's just a child!
- I'm not a child!

65
00:06:01,888 --> 00:06:05,408
So just leave him alone. Breca
couldn't have done anything!

66
00:06:06,248 --> 00:06:09,848
People died and it was my fault.
Is that what you want to hear?

67
00:06:46,568 --> 00:06:48,568
Step forward in peace.

68
00:07:06,448 --> 00:07:08,448
I am Kela of the Mere.

69
00:07:09,528 --> 00:07:13,848
From my father and my tribe, I
bring you greetings of good faith.

70
00:07:13,888 --> 00:07:15,888
I am Rheda of Herot.

71
00:07:15,928 --> 00:07:18,328
You are most welcome in my home.

72
00:07:18,368 --> 00:07:21,128
I'm sorry also for your loss.

73
00:07:22,328 --> 00:07:24,128
Thank you.

74
00:07:24,168 --> 00:07:25,968
Come.

75
00:07:26,008 --> 00:07:28,208
This is your betrothed.

76
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,008
My son Slean.

77
00:07:32,008 --> 00:07:35,248
This marriage will
strengthen both our peoples.

78
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:38,728
But, more than that, I hope
you will be happy together.

79
00:07:40,568 --> 00:07:42,568
Tell us about your home.

80
00:07:42,608 --> 00:07:44,848
It must be very different for you here.

81
00:07:44,888 --> 00:07:47,208
You certainly have more gold than we do.

82
00:07:47,248 --> 00:07:49,438
We also have iron. Herot makes the best

83
00:07:49,463 --> 00:07:51,848
weapons in the land, as your father knows.

84
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:55,368
He was pleased with the dowry
you sent. Mere is well armed now.

85
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:58,928
I hear that the Warig have been
causing your father some concern,

86
00:07:58,968 --> 00:08:00,968
that he fears they may be rising again.

87
00:08:01,008 --> 00:08:03,150
They killed my mother, slaughtered our

88
00:08:03,175 --> 00:08:05,152
people and no-one came to our aid.

89
00:08:06,288 --> 00:08:08,608
For years, they've kept their distance.

90
00:08:08,648 --> 00:08:12,808
Now they're back. They have a
leader, 'a prophet' they call him.

91
00:08:12,848 --> 00:08:14,953
And he tells them the time has come to

92
00:08:14,978 --> 00:08:17,328
wash the Shieldlands clean with red blood.

93
00:08:17,368 --> 00:08:19,088
Not whilst Herot rules.

94
00:08:19,128 --> 00:08:20,728
You're safe here.

95
00:08:22,688 --> 00:08:24,688
Slean, ride for Bregan.

96
00:08:25,768 --> 00:08:28,048
Tell Abrecan of this Warig prophet.

97
00:08:29,048 --> 00:08:31,528
If they are turning, we'll need our allies.

98
00:08:32,607 --> 00:08:34,328
Come.

99
00:08:55,648 --> 00:08:57,248
Stood there.

100
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,768
Abrecan, there's something you should see.

101
00:09:03,848 --> 00:09:05,408
Alone.

102
00:09:25,808 --> 00:09:29,547
- So, where does Slean's loyalties lie?
- With your sister.

103
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:34,008
The marriage she arranged to the
girl from the Mere. He'll honour it.

104
00:09:34,048 --> 00:09:36,168
He seems determined to be a loyal son.

105
00:09:38,528 --> 00:09:40,528
And yet he let you go.

106
00:09:40,568 --> 00:09:42,368
Why kill the messenger?

107
00:09:42,408 --> 00:09:46,248
He knows you were behind it all,
killing Bayen, Scorann's death.

108
00:09:46,288 --> 00:09:48,384
Scorann was never meant to die, was he?

109
00:09:48,409 --> 00:09:50,032
Do you think Rheda will care?

110
00:09:51,848 --> 00:09:53,848
If I were you, I'd watch your back.

111
00:10:20,888 --> 00:10:22,888
This has got away from me.

112
00:10:25,048 --> 00:10:30,248
You realise that all Slean has
to do is tell Rheda of your deeds

113
00:10:30,288 --> 00:10:32,288
and you lose everything.

114
00:10:32,328 --> 00:10:36,328
If Slean wanted to destroy me, he
would have done so at the Gathering.

115
00:10:38,648 --> 00:10:41,928
Instead, he pinned the blame on the Varni.

116
00:10:41,968 --> 00:10:45,608
He's a man whose ambition is
at war with his conscience.

117
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,688
And that's useful to me.

118
00:10:49,928 --> 00:10:54,488
For now. He knows Herot and
its ways and I can use that.

119
00:11:25,608 --> 00:11:27,608
I know that look.

120
00:11:27,648 --> 00:11:29,093
- You do?
- What happened before,

121
00:11:29,118 --> 00:11:30,488
we should try to leave it.

122
00:11:30,528 --> 00:11:32,008
Why?

123
00:11:33,008 --> 00:11:35,008
I know you're not in love with Slean.

124
00:11:35,048 --> 00:11:36,576
Slean has nothing to do with you

125
00:11:36,601 --> 00:11:38,272
- and me.
- So there is a you and me?

126
00:11:47,008 --> 00:11:48,608
I knew it.

127
00:11:55,008 --> 00:11:57,156
- Stop this, both of you.
- I turn

128
00:11:57,181 --> 00:11:59,448
my back and you take my woman!

129
00:11:59,488 --> 00:12:01,088
Please!

130
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,608
Shall we go back inside?

131
00:12:19,408 --> 00:12:21,408
Have you lost your minds?

132
00:12:53,128 --> 00:12:55,728
- What's going on?
- Nothing's going on.

133
00:12:55,768 --> 00:12:58,528
I'm riding to Bregan as you instructed.

134
00:12:58,568 --> 00:13:00,568
We need our allies, remember?

135
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:04,648
It's done. It's over.

136
00:13:06,008 --> 00:13:08,288
Which is what you wanted.

137
00:13:08,328 --> 00:13:11,288
- What does that mean?
- Beowulf and Elvina together.

138
00:13:11,328 --> 00:13:14,528
Is that why you sent them
off to the Mere without me?

139
00:13:14,568 --> 00:13:16,288
Not exactly, no.

140
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:19,928
Just a happy coincidence for you,
then? But I don't believe that.

141
00:13:20,928 --> 00:13:23,248
Whatever I have, you find a way to take it!

142
00:13:32,328 --> 00:13:34,328
Slean, wait!

143
00:13:38,408 --> 00:13:41,808
Do you even understand the
meaning of the word 'discretion'?

144
00:13:41,848 --> 00:13:44,156
It's taken weeks for him to come around.

145
00:13:44,181 --> 00:13:46,408
All of it undone. All of it worthless.

146
00:13:46,448 --> 00:13:49,528
Is it my fault your son finds
offence wherever he looks?

147
00:13:49,568 --> 00:13:51,168
A troll!

148
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:54,208
Attacked me. Tried to kill me.

149
00:13:54,248 --> 00:13:56,048
Where?

150
00:13:56,088 --> 00:14:00,608
In the forest, right on the edge
of our claim, by the old workings.

151
00:14:00,648 --> 00:14:03,617
We need protection. It's
not safe out there. You're

152
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:06,528
supposed to be looking
after us. That's the deal.

153
00:14:06,568 --> 00:14:09,168
- Where is the troll now?
- It's dead.

154
00:14:11,008 --> 00:14:13,408
- I killed it.
- You killed it?

155
00:14:13,448 --> 00:14:15,328
I didn't exactly mean to.

156
00:14:15,368 --> 00:14:17,795
When they find out that a
man has killed one of their

157
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,088
own, they'll slaughter
every miner they can find.

158
00:14:20,128 --> 00:14:21,728
And then...

159
00:14:21,768 --> 00:14:23,768
they'll come for us.

160
00:14:29,643 --> 00:14:31,643
But why did it attack you?

161
00:14:31,683 --> 00:14:34,563
How should I know? Normally,
they just leave us be.

162
00:14:34,603 --> 00:14:36,883
We mind our business, they mind theirs.

163
00:14:36,923 --> 00:14:38,923
You must have done something.

164
00:14:38,963 --> 00:14:40,963
I'm telling you, it just...

165
00:14:41,003 --> 00:14:43,323
It came at me like it was mad or something.

166
00:14:43,363 --> 00:14:45,363
Hey. Hey.

167
00:14:58,843 --> 00:15:02,323
He doesn't look like he's after
vengeance for his dead friend.

168
00:15:02,363 --> 00:15:04,163
I know.

169
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:06,203
He's happy.

170
00:15:07,883 --> 00:15:09,883
What's that?

171
00:15:09,923 --> 00:15:11,523
Salt.

172
00:15:11,563 --> 00:15:14,683
We put it out. It keeps 'em placid.

173
00:15:19,163 --> 00:15:21,163
Trolls are mountainborn.

174
00:15:21,203 --> 00:15:24,883
If they can't get salt from the
rock, they'll get it from red blood.

175
00:15:24,923 --> 00:15:26,923
Yeah? Right.

176
00:15:26,963 --> 00:15:28,963
Are you sure you put yours out?

177
00:15:29,003 --> 00:15:31,003
Of course I did.

178
00:15:31,043 --> 00:15:33,043
I'm not an idiot.

179
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,683
This way.

180
00:15:34,723 --> 00:15:36,723
I'll show you the one I killed.

181
00:15:51,643 --> 00:15:53,843
I don't think you killed it enough.

182
00:15:53,883 --> 00:15:55,883
It... It was there. It was dead.

183
00:15:56,963 --> 00:15:59,763
It was a figment of your
imagination, more likely.

184
00:15:59,803 --> 00:16:01,803
- Had you been drinking?
- No.

185
00:16:03,203 --> 00:16:06,723
Well, yeah, yeah, but I swear,
right, it tried to climb the tree.

186
00:16:06,763 --> 00:16:09,083
- But then I... I got...
- You killed it. Right.

187
00:16:11,163 --> 00:16:13,163
Drinking what, exactly?

188
00:16:15,163 --> 00:16:17,643
We can't have come all
this way for nothing.

189
00:16:18,723 --> 00:16:20,723
- I'm thirsty.
- Yes!

190
00:16:20,763 --> 00:16:22,763
Follow me.

191
00:16:44,843 --> 00:16:47,443
Should I feel sorry
for the post or for you?

192
00:16:47,483 --> 00:16:49,963
They let you out of
the hall? I'm surprised.

193
00:16:50,003 --> 00:16:52,003
They were distracted.

194
00:16:53,363 --> 00:16:57,083
And... I was curious to
see what happens round here.

195
00:16:58,163 --> 00:17:00,163
They smelt iron.

196
00:17:04,762 --> 00:17:06,762
What did you think of Slean?

197
00:17:07,843 --> 00:17:10,242
I hardly saw him before he left for Bregan.

198
00:17:10,282 --> 00:17:13,203
I can't think of anything
worse than being married,

199
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:15,242
being in love.

200
00:17:16,323 --> 00:17:18,323
Who said anything about love?

201
00:17:19,403 --> 00:17:21,883
This is about power, that's all.

202
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:46,363
Everybody's doing some job or another.

203
00:17:49,363 --> 00:17:51,803
- What's mine?
- I don't know.

204
00:17:51,843 --> 00:17:53,843
Marry Slean.

205
00:17:53,883 --> 00:17:55,883
Be a good wife.

206
00:17:55,923 --> 00:17:57,923
That's not a job.

207
00:17:57,963 --> 00:17:59,963
I think you can do what you want.

208
00:18:00,003 --> 00:18:03,683
Vishka! I heard you got on
the wrong end of a Warig.

209
00:18:03,723 --> 00:18:06,543
- Good news travels fast.
- Look at you! I let you out of

210
00:18:06,568 --> 00:18:09,363
my sight just once and you
go get in a proper fight.

211
00:18:09,403 --> 00:18:11,963
Are you all right,
though? It wasn't too bad?

212
00:18:12,003 --> 00:18:14,696
- Elvina fixed it up.
- So, how many did you take down?

213
00:18:14,721 --> 00:18:16,923
Or did they just run at the sight of you?

214
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:20,043
Brinni, this is Kela of the Mere.

215
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,163
So you're a warrior.

216
00:18:22,203 --> 00:18:25,283
Anything that comes through
that gate has to answer to me.

217
00:18:25,323 --> 00:18:26,723
Really?

218
00:18:26,763 --> 00:18:28,363
You must be good.

219
00:18:28,403 --> 00:18:29,923
Well...

220
00:18:30,923 --> 00:18:32,723
He's not that good.

221
00:20:00,363 --> 00:20:02,363
Vorhelm!

222
00:20:03,443 --> 00:20:05,443
Vorhelm, you lazy drunk!

223
00:20:09,163 --> 00:20:10,963
Hey-hey!

224
00:20:11,003 --> 00:20:13,003
Where the hell have you been?

225
00:20:13,043 --> 00:20:15,243
This is Vorhelm, my brother.

226
00:20:15,283 --> 00:20:17,283
This is Beowulf, the Reeve.

227
00:20:17,323 --> 00:20:19,323
- And I'm Breca.
- Hello.

228
00:20:19,363 --> 00:20:23,083
- Did you sort the troll?
- What troll? You saw it, too?

229
00:20:23,123 --> 00:20:24,923
No, but...

230
00:20:24,963 --> 00:20:26,963
- It's gone.
- Gone?

231
00:20:27,003 --> 00:20:29,003
If it was ever there.

232
00:20:29,043 --> 00:20:31,323
You don't imagine something like that!

233
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,283
Look! Look!

234
00:20:33,323 --> 00:20:35,603
My axe, Beowulf found it.

235
00:20:35,643 --> 00:20:37,443
It's proof!

236
00:20:37,483 --> 00:20:40,003
You might, if you're drinking this stuff.

237
00:20:40,043 --> 00:20:41,883
We brew it ourselves.

238
00:20:41,923 --> 00:20:45,403
- Really?
- Want to try some? It's good stuff.

239
00:20:57,643 --> 00:21:01,123
Rider approaches! Open the gates!

240
00:21:12,603 --> 00:21:14,603
Slean!

241
00:21:17,363 --> 00:21:19,363
Well, well.

242
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:22,363
This is an unexpected pleasure.

243
00:21:24,243 --> 00:21:26,363
There are matters we need to discuss.

244
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:31,763
Oh. Er... This is my Saray.

245
00:21:31,803 --> 00:21:33,803
Come inside. Warm yourself.

246
00:21:41,123 --> 00:21:43,403
You have no enemies here, Slean.

247
00:21:44,483 --> 00:21:48,363
I think I should judge that, don't you?

248
00:21:57,003 --> 00:21:59,283
I thought the miners slept in the trees.

249
00:21:59,323 --> 00:22:02,043
Yeah, most folks do. It's
a good way to stay safe.

250
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:04,203
But, er, you can't brew this up there.

251
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:07,283
So Vorhelm and me, we risk it.

252
00:22:08,363 --> 00:22:10,585
- What's it made from?
- A kind of root

253
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:12,683
that looks like a horse's tackle.

254
00:22:14,763 --> 00:22:20,163
Right. You're sure it's not gonna
make us all see invisible trolls?

255
00:22:20,203 --> 00:22:22,483
Eh, eh! It was real. All right?

256
00:22:22,523 --> 00:22:24,523
It... It was real and it was big.

257
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:27,243
All right, say it was real.

258
00:22:27,283 --> 00:22:30,763
There hasn't been a troll attack
around here in years. Why now?

259
00:22:30,803 --> 00:22:33,203
Sometimes, they go rogue.

260
00:22:33,243 --> 00:22:35,243
Old bulls, mainly.

261
00:22:36,323 --> 00:22:38,123
Did it look old?

262
00:22:38,163 --> 00:22:40,483
How should I know? It looked like a troll.

263
00:22:40,523 --> 00:22:43,323
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You
thought it looked dead.

264
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:45,363
And then... it wasn't.

265
00:22:45,403 --> 00:22:47,403
Are you sure it was a troll?

266
00:22:47,443 --> 00:22:50,763
You weren't attacked by
a bush or a giant rabbit?

267
00:22:54,043 --> 00:22:56,043
Have there been any other attacks?

268
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:59,483
- Is something stirring them up?
- Not that we've heard of. Why?

269
00:22:59,523 --> 00:23:01,723
I'm seeing the bottom of this.

270
00:23:01,763 --> 00:23:04,043
The thing about trolls is...

271
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:06,523
you rub along with them all right.

272
00:23:06,563 --> 00:23:09,243
You keep to your mine,
they keep to their woods.

273
00:23:10,323 --> 00:23:13,403
You put the salt out for 'em.
You stay off their trails.

274
00:23:13,443 --> 00:23:14,836
And you start to think

275
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:16,483
- they're all right.
- Yeah.

276
00:23:16,523 --> 00:23:18,803
That they're safe.

277
00:23:18,843 --> 00:23:20,843
That they're not beasts.

278
00:23:21,963 --> 00:23:23,963
But they are.

279
00:23:43,003 --> 00:23:44,923
A toast.

280
00:23:44,963 --> 00:23:46,683
Good health.

281
00:23:54,763 --> 00:23:57,123
What brings you to Bregan, Slean?

282
00:23:57,163 --> 00:23:59,363
My mother sends a warning.

283
00:24:02,003 --> 00:24:05,083
The Warig are gathering under
a seer who advocates war.

284
00:24:05,123 --> 00:24:07,280
They're already pressing the Mere and

285
00:24:07,305 --> 00:24:09,323
they've attacked in the Edgelands.

286
00:24:09,363 --> 00:24:11,683
If they keep coming, Herot...

287
00:24:11,723 --> 00:24:13,723
or Bregan could be next.

288
00:24:15,403 --> 00:24:17,403
And we both know that...

289
00:24:19,163 --> 00:24:21,163
Herot is not ready for war.

290
00:24:21,203 --> 00:24:24,523
Which is why my mother sends
me to her most trusted brother.

291
00:24:25,443 --> 00:24:28,523
If the Alliance stands
together, it stands strong.

292
00:24:30,763 --> 00:24:33,083
Which of us will tell her she's mistaken?

293
00:24:36,763 --> 00:24:38,363
Saray.

294
00:24:39,483 --> 00:24:43,483
I think Slean would like
to... speak with me alone.

295
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:45,523
Of course.

296
00:25:11,563 --> 00:25:13,363
Well?

297
00:25:13,403 --> 00:25:15,403
They're talking. Alone.

298
00:25:17,403 --> 00:25:20,723
If you ask me, we should kill
Slean, while we have the chance.

299
00:25:20,763 --> 00:25:22,763
Make it look like an accident.

300
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:26,123
And why would anyone ask you?

301
00:25:28,963 --> 00:25:30,963
Two simple tasks.

302
00:25:31,003 --> 00:25:34,283
Keep Scorann from the Gathering
and get Slean on our side.

303
00:25:34,323 --> 00:25:36,723
You? You failed at both.

304
00:25:37,803 --> 00:25:40,803
With it, you've forfeited
your right to an opinion.

305
00:25:40,843 --> 00:25:43,843
Sometimes, I think you
forget you're just a healer.

306
00:25:44,923 --> 00:25:46,923
You preserve life.

307
00:25:47,923 --> 00:25:52,563
I take it and, when I do, I don't hesitate.

308
00:26:02,723 --> 00:26:04,723
So then the big one comes at me.

309
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:06,123
Fast!

310
00:26:06,163 --> 00:26:08,195
Like a bear! And the other one gets

311
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,283
me by the legs and down I go. Crash!

312
00:26:10,323 --> 00:26:14,643
And, straight away, the big
one is on me, pinning me down.

313
00:26:14,683 --> 00:26:18,283
I swear, I could feel the
life being crushed out of me.

314
00:26:21,643 --> 00:26:23,643
So what did you do?

315
00:26:23,683 --> 00:26:25,923
I thought it was all over.

316
00:26:25,963 --> 00:26:28,403
And then the big one's husband comes in.

317
00:26:28,443 --> 00:26:31,123
- Oh ho ho!
- He starts kicking me

318
00:26:31,163 --> 00:26:33,283
and she starts shrieking and lets go.

319
00:26:33,323 --> 00:26:35,637
So I seized my chance
and I ran and I didn't

320
00:26:35,662 --> 00:26:37,667
stop until I made it into the forest.

321
00:26:38,443 --> 00:26:40,843
And I never got my clothes back.

322
00:26:47,803 --> 00:26:50,923
What about you? Any narrow
escapes in your past?

323
00:26:50,963 --> 00:26:54,163
My whole past has been a narrow escape!

324
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:00,923
Please! Aaah! Vorhelm!

325
00:27:02,043 --> 00:27:04,243
It's real! It's real!

326
00:27:05,443 --> 00:27:06,763
Urgh!

327
00:27:06,803 --> 00:27:08,763
Beowulf?

328
00:27:08,803 --> 00:27:10,923
Greff? Help!

329
00:27:12,683 --> 00:27:14,443
Greff!

330
00:27:31,443 --> 00:27:32,963
Climb!

331
00:28:21,612 --> 00:28:23,612
Scorann is dead because of you.

332
00:28:25,092 --> 00:28:28,452
If you were not my uncle,
I would take your life.

333
00:28:28,492 --> 00:28:30,492
Or die trying.

334
00:28:32,092 --> 00:28:34,572
I know your men stand ready to kill me.

335
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:36,612
Is that what you think?

336
00:28:38,932 --> 00:28:41,412
Slean, I do not want you dead.

337
00:28:41,452 --> 00:28:43,452
I want you to be Thane.

338
00:28:44,532 --> 00:28:46,252
Why?

339
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:48,292
You already run Herot.

340
00:28:48,332 --> 00:28:50,812
The miners know you. The smelters know you.

341
00:28:50,852 --> 00:28:54,452
The Huskarla answer to you. You
are Thane already in all but name.

342
00:28:55,532 --> 00:28:58,132
I think your plan is to
use me to kill my mother.

343
00:28:59,692 --> 00:29:03,172
And, once you've done that,
you'll have no use for me any more.

344
00:29:06,692 --> 00:29:08,692
I love my sister.

345
00:29:09,772 --> 00:29:11,772
And I would never harm her.

346
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:17,452
But she is not the leader our tribes need.

347
00:29:18,652 --> 00:29:20,252
You know it.

348
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:23,332
Herot needs a real Thane.

349
00:29:23,372 --> 00:29:28,092
And the Shieldlands need a
true Jarl to lead its tribes.

350
00:29:30,412 --> 00:29:32,412
Both need to be warriors.

351
00:29:33,492 --> 00:29:35,292
Men...

352
00:29:35,332 --> 00:29:37,612
who know how to protect their people.

353
00:29:38,692 --> 00:29:40,692
You could be one.

354
00:29:41,772 --> 00:29:43,772
And I the other.

355
00:29:47,052 --> 00:29:49,052
If we do this...

356
00:29:51,772 --> 00:29:53,772
my mother must come to no harm.

357
00:29:53,812 --> 00:29:55,812
I promise you.

358
00:29:57,692 --> 00:30:01,692
But you know, in your heart,
she cannot lead us to victory.

359
00:30:23,332 --> 00:30:25,745
You would think that
a simple marriage would

360
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:28,236
be the easiest thing
in the world to manage.

361
00:30:29,292 --> 00:30:31,572
Instead, we have a replacement bride...

362
00:30:32,892 --> 00:30:36,372
and a bridegroom brawling in
the street with his own reeve.

363
00:30:39,372 --> 00:30:43,052
Who knows how long it'll be before
he cools down and comes back?

364
00:30:43,092 --> 00:30:46,692
Is it strictly necessary for the
groom to be present at a wedding?

365
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:50,892
I can imagine things would
be a lot simpler without him!

366
00:30:54,412 --> 00:30:58,132
When you were with the Varni,
you trained with weapons?

367
00:31:00,132 --> 00:31:02,132
Every day.

368
00:31:03,132 --> 00:31:05,252
- Every warrior?
- Every warrior.

369
00:31:05,292 --> 00:31:07,292
Every woman.

370
00:31:08,292 --> 00:31:10,492
Every child big enough to hold a sword.

371
00:31:11,492 --> 00:31:14,092
The warriors may be the teeth of the wolf.

372
00:31:15,252 --> 00:31:18,052
Sometimes, a beast
needs its claws, as well.

373
00:31:19,132 --> 00:31:21,132
That's what Beowulf thinks.

374
00:31:21,172 --> 00:31:23,172
If war is coming...

375
00:31:24,252 --> 00:31:26,252
we need to prepare.

376
00:31:26,292 --> 00:31:29,492
When he returns, give him what he needs.

377
00:31:40,332 --> 00:31:42,332
Breca!

378
00:31:44,692 --> 00:31:46,692
Where's the troll?

379
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,492
I dealt with it.

380
00:31:53,532 --> 00:31:55,532
So it didn't just attack once.

381
00:31:55,572 --> 00:31:57,172
It came back.

382
00:31:57,212 --> 00:31:59,212
That's not usual.

383
00:31:59,252 --> 00:32:01,252
Something drove it to this.

384
00:32:05,692 --> 00:32:08,292
Over here! The salt I left out for 'em.

385
00:32:08,332 --> 00:32:10,332
A fresh batch.

386
00:32:19,692 --> 00:32:21,692
It's light.

387
00:32:30,452 --> 00:32:32,452
What is that?

388
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:34,292
Sand.

389
00:32:34,332 --> 00:32:37,332
An inch of salt to cover it
up and the rest is just sand.

390
00:32:39,412 --> 00:32:41,412
These old ones are good, but...

391
00:32:41,452 --> 00:32:43,452
they're nearly used up.

392
00:32:43,492 --> 00:32:45,580
So when they get to the new ones, all

393
00:32:45,605 --> 00:32:48,076
they're going to get is a mouthful of grit.

394
00:32:49,452 --> 00:32:51,452
They're gonna go mad.

395
00:32:52,532 --> 00:32:54,532
They'll kill everyone!

396
00:32:58,692 --> 00:33:00,692
We need more salt.

397
00:33:38,692 --> 00:33:40,692
You two have talked the day away.

398
00:33:41,772 --> 00:33:43,972
Yeah, well, there was a lot to say.

399
00:33:44,012 --> 00:33:47,012
- He's a good man.
- What? Did he tell you to say that?

400
00:33:47,052 --> 00:33:48,852
It's the truth.

401
00:33:50,052 --> 00:33:51,852
Tell me this.

402
00:33:51,892 --> 00:33:54,772
If Abrecan had been a poor
fisherman and not a Thane,

403
00:33:54,812 --> 00:33:58,092
his hands all covered in fish
scales and cut by the lines...

404
00:33:59,212 --> 00:34:01,212
would you still love him?

405
00:34:01,252 --> 00:34:04,052
You may not believe it,
but I've known good and bad.

406
00:34:05,052 --> 00:34:07,052
I've looked them in the face.

407
00:34:07,092 --> 00:34:11,092
And I've done bad things, with
bad men, for the worst of reasons.

408
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,132
Abrecan is a good man.

409
00:34:21,252 --> 00:34:22,532
Yaaah!

410
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,812
Attack the village! Kill them all!

411
00:34:36,812 --> 00:34:38,812
Raiders!

412
00:34:38,851 --> 00:34:40,851
Come on!

413
00:34:44,812 --> 00:34:46,331
Go!

414
00:34:55,812 --> 00:34:57,692
Yaaah! Yaaah!

415
00:34:58,692 --> 00:35:00,292
Yaaah!

416
00:35:19,172 --> 00:35:21,132
Yaaah-aaah-aaah!

417
00:35:24,172 --> 00:35:26,452
- Wulfing raiders!
- Get inside.

418
00:35:26,492 --> 00:35:30,492
Hold them back! Defend the
walls! Get those gates closed!

419
00:35:30,532 --> 00:35:34,132
Are you at my side? Or would
you rather ride home to Herot?

420
00:35:36,852 --> 00:35:38,572
Away!

421
00:35:47,532 --> 00:35:49,292
Go! Go!

422
00:36:15,092 --> 00:36:17,492
Leave the girl. Take the gate!

423
00:36:24,052 --> 00:36:26,052
Go on! Go on!

424
00:36:27,132 --> 00:36:28,732
Whaaah!

425
00:36:51,172 --> 00:36:53,172
Burn it all!

426
00:37:08,412 --> 00:37:10,412
Stop them!

427
00:37:20,012 --> 00:37:21,412
Urgh.

428
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:59,052
To the boat! To the boats!

429
00:37:59,092 --> 00:38:00,852
Yaaa-aaah! Yaaah!

430
00:38:04,572 --> 00:38:06,572
Uhh! Uhh...

431
00:38:13,252 --> 00:38:15,252
- Aah!
- Do you feel that?

432
00:38:15,292 --> 00:38:17,292
That's defeat.

433
00:38:19,532 --> 00:38:21,132
Come on!

434
00:38:21,172 --> 00:38:23,172
Come on!

435
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:29,732
After them!

436
00:38:29,772 --> 00:38:32,212
No. No, no, no. They've gone. They've gone.

437
00:38:36,092 --> 00:38:38,092
But they have paid.

438
00:38:38,132 --> 00:38:40,132
Not as hard as we have.

439
00:38:42,452 --> 00:38:45,852
But they won't return.
They know we'll be waiting.

440
00:38:45,892 --> 00:38:49,372
We should light the tower,
warn the other tribes.

441
00:38:49,412 --> 00:38:51,252
No.

442
00:38:51,292 --> 00:38:53,292
No. Leave the signal fire unlit.

443
00:38:53,332 --> 00:38:55,460
Let's see how Beowulf fares if the

444
00:38:55,485 --> 00:38:57,892
raiders attack when Herot's not ready.

445
00:38:57,932 --> 00:39:01,732
It will weaken my mother in the eyes
of her people and of the Alliance.

446
00:39:02,972 --> 00:39:04,972
I knew I was right about you.

447
00:39:05,972 --> 00:39:07,972
What is it?

448
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:11,772
Help me! Help me!

449
00:39:12,932 --> 00:39:14,412
Aaah.

450
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:16,852
- Get him inside now.
- Put your arm round me.

451
00:39:16,892 --> 00:39:20,292
Open the gates! The gates!

452
00:39:20,332 --> 00:39:21,932
Quickly!

453
00:39:32,772 --> 00:39:34,772
They're all worthless.

454
00:39:34,812 --> 00:39:36,812
Someone did this to harm us.

455
00:39:36,852 --> 00:39:39,292
- You think it's the Warig prophet?
- No.

456
00:39:39,332 --> 00:39:41,332
This is not a mudborn threat.

457
00:39:42,332 --> 00:39:44,332
Whoever's behind this is a man...

458
00:39:44,372 --> 00:39:46,372
and a traitor.

459
00:39:47,892 --> 00:39:49,892
A traitor in Herot?

460
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:52,972
I don't think so.

461
00:40:01,012 --> 00:40:03,732
Scrape together all the
salt we have in Herot.

462
00:40:03,772 --> 00:40:07,412
It should be enough to pacify
the trolls until we can get more.

463
00:40:07,452 --> 00:40:09,452
The salt came from Bregan.

464
00:40:09,492 --> 00:40:11,492
Someone there did this to us.

465
00:40:12,572 --> 00:40:14,692
Or someone wanted it to look that way.

466
00:40:16,452 --> 00:40:19,262
The Varni wanted the miners
to sell them their ore.

467
00:40:19,287 --> 00:40:21,532
This could be their idea of retribution.

468
00:40:21,572 --> 00:40:23,332
Maybe.

469
00:40:24,492 --> 00:40:26,612
I'll go to Bregan, see what I can find.

470
00:40:27,652 --> 00:40:30,252
My brother will help you
root out this traitor.

471
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:36,212
Aaah.

472
00:40:37,332 --> 00:40:41,492
It's a clean wound, not too
deep. We can bind and poultice it.

473
00:40:41,532 --> 00:40:45,852
My arse, it's clean. Those Wulfing
blades are thick with filth!

474
00:40:45,892 --> 00:40:47,892
- Aaah! Urgh!
- Steady.

475
00:40:49,732 --> 00:40:53,092
Send Vlade to see if
they are headed for Herot.

476
00:40:53,132 --> 00:40:54,932
- Aaah!
- Stay still.

477
00:40:54,972 --> 00:40:59,732
We lost Rennick and we lost
Tove for such little gold.

478
00:40:59,772 --> 00:41:01,772
Then we strike again!

479
00:41:02,852 --> 00:41:04,852
We've already wounded their Thane.

480
00:41:06,412 --> 00:41:08,412
He could be dead by now, Jogan.

481
00:41:08,452 --> 00:41:10,175
They are a hundred to our dozen!

482
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,276
- They are weak!
- No!

483
00:41:16,652 --> 00:41:18,652
We lost this battle.

484
00:41:20,772 --> 00:41:22,772
Then we go home, then?

485
00:41:24,852 --> 00:41:27,532
With our tails between our legs,

486
00:41:27,572 --> 00:41:32,572
with nothing to show our clan
or your brother, our war father?

487
00:41:34,372 --> 00:41:36,372
Or perhaps...

488
00:41:37,732 --> 00:41:40,532
we leave these fishermen
to their fish guts...

489
00:41:42,212 --> 00:41:45,492
and go for a different
target, a bigger target.

490
00:41:46,652 --> 00:41:48,972
Bregan have not lit their warning fires.

491
00:41:50,332 --> 00:41:52,852
And Herot does not know we are coming.

492
00:41:52,892 --> 00:41:55,132
And it is there we have to surprise

493
00:41:55,172 --> 00:41:57,172
and it is there

494
00:41:57,212 --> 00:41:59,212
we find gold and iron.

495
00:42:00,012 --> 00:42:02,292
We strike them deep in their heart.

496
00:42:02,332 --> 00:42:06,132
And, this time, we don't leave
the dog to guard the boat.

497
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:14,212
Get the dog! It comes with us.

498
00:42:20,132 --> 00:42:22,452
Do whatever you have to to protect Herot.

499
00:42:26,732 --> 00:42:28,732
Our enemies are coming.

500
00:42:44,372 --> 00:42:46,372
Ready?

501
00:42:46,412 --> 00:42:48,812
We will go to Herot
and tear out its throat.

502
00:42:59,372 --> 00:43:01,641
I followed the Wulfings
as far as the Draca Bridge.

503
00:43:01,666 --> 00:43:03,212
Good. So they are bound for Herot.

504
00:43:06,932 --> 00:43:09,012
Wulfing raiders killed my husband.

505
00:43:09,052 --> 00:43:10,512
If we don't strike back, they'll

506
00:43:10,537 --> 00:43:11,972
- think we're weak.
- We are weak!

507
00:43:12,012 --> 00:43:15,052
- Where's Kela?
- She's pretty. She'll fetch a price.

508
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:18,892
I don't care how you do
it, but you get her back.

509
00:43:25,052 --> 00:43:26,652
Vishka, throw me the axe.

510
00:43:28,332 --> 00:43:29,760
Throw it!

511
00:43:30,305 --> 00:43:36,598
