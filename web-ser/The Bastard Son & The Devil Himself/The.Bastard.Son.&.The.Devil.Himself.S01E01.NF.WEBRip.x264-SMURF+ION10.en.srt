1
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,400
It should be around here somewhere.

2
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,440
So, do you think it's true?

3
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,920
What they say about him?
That he's the wolf's child?

4
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,040
Fine, be like that.

5
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,560
There.

6
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,080

This your property?

16
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,880
No.

17
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,160
- Can I ask you what you're doing here?
- No.

18
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,280
We've had reports of suspicious activity
on the premises, so...

19
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,520
- What do you think?
- Excuse me.

20
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,360
If you can't tell me what you're doing,
I'll have to arrest you.

21
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,200
Excuse me. I'm talking to you.

22
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,000
I just need you both
to step away from the house.

23
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,920
Aww, shit.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,960
Had enough of this.
You're under arrest.

25
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,680
- Just hold that thought.
- You don't have to say anything.

26
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,080
But it may harm your defense...

27
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,040
Fuck off.

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,680
Her kids are in here.

29
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,600
You shouldn't touch it.

30
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,960
Why not?

31
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,680
Because yeah, I do think it's true.

32
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,240
Gran.

33
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,000
<i>The boy can stay here
along with his sister,</i>

34
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,080
<i>but only as a ward of the council.</i>

35
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,160
<i>We'll have legal rights over him.</i>

36
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,280
<i>Under what laws exactly?</i>

37
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,440
Under the only laws that matter.

38
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,480
The laws of
the Council of Fairborn Witches.

39
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,800
If or when he proves to be a threat
to the Fairborn Witch community,

40
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,520
then we'll move him.

41
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,160
You're scared of him already.

42
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,040
The war's over, you know.

43
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,560
Thanks for the tea.

44
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,880
What are you going to call him?

45
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,920
His mother was going to name him Nathan.

46
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,560
Nathan.

47
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,880
<i>There have always been witches
in the world.</i>

48
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,440
<i>Blood Witches and Fairborn Witches.</i>

49
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,360
- There's us and the fains.
- What are fains?

50
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,000
Fains are the ones
with no magic in them...

51
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,080
...and no interest in it either.

52
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,120
Almost everyone in the world is a fain.

53
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,920
That means that almost everyone you meet,

54
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,640
you'll have to keep a secret from.

55
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,720
Why?

56
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,480
People are scared of us.

57
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,880
Are witches bad?

58
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,960
No.

59
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,880
Though some of them
are so full of darkness

60
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,640
that when you look into their eyes,

61
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,440
you think
you'll never see the light again.

62
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,520
Hmm.

63
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,960
- But we're good?
- Yes.

64
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,200
- And we're Fairborn Witches?
- Yes.

65
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,800
Am I a Fairborn Witch, Gran?

66
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,880
No.

67
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,000
Am I a Blood Witch?

68
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,080
You're my grandson.

69
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,720
You're Nathan Byrne.

70
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,960
And for now, that'll do just fine.

71
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,016
Do you know one
of the ways you can tell a Blood Witch

72
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,200
from us Fairborn Witches?

73
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,480
How much quicker they heal.

74
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,880
- How are you sleeping at night?
- Okay.

75
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,960
Do you find yourself
getting quick to anger?

76
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,160
No.

77
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,120
If you listen carefully,
can you hear my heartbeat?

78
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,320
No.

79
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,840
Do you ever have negative feelings
about other witches?

80
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,920
No.

81
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,520
Nathan.

82
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,560
- Sometimes.
- Who?

83
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,480
My sister.

84
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,480
Because she's a Fairborn Witch?

85
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,000
- No.
- Why then?

86
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,520
She stinks.

87
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,880
Thirty-five seconds.

88
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,640
That's good. That's about the same as me.

89
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,400
Do you want to know why
everyone hates us so much?

90
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,000
Why our people won't talk to us?

91
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,680
It's because of what your dad did.

92
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,080
He killed witches.

93
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,280
A lot of them.

94
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,080
He locked them in a room,
and he turned into a wild animal

95
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,760
and ran from each of them.

96
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,200
Men and women.

97
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,760
Little children and babies.

98
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,640
And he tore out their throats.

99
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,800
But that's not even the worst part.

100
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,080
The worst part is what he did next.

101
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,000
Because your dad can take
other witches' powers.

102
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,400
Do you know how?

103
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,720
He rips their heart out of their body
and eats it,

104
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,200
while it's still warm.

105
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,480
He's a monster.

106
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,640
The most evil Blood Witch that ever lived.

107
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,920
He put a baby in my mom,
so she killed herself when you were born.

108
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,920
Why do you think they ask
if you can hear heartbeats?

109
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,360
It's because they're very scared.

110
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,640
Scared you're going to
turn into a monster.

111
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,720
Just like him.

112
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,960
Do you ever have violent dreams?

113
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,880
No.

114
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,040
Do you find yourself
getting quick to anger?

115
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,360
No.

116
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,200
Do you have fantasies
about hurting people?

117
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,360
- Only their feelings.
- How are you sleeping?

118
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,200
Butt naked with a window open.
How about you?

119
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,680
Do you ever have violent dreams?

120
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,480
Dreamt I was singing
in the school assembly,

121
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,880
but my microphone wouldn't turn on,
and everyone was booing me.

122
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,920
What do you think that means?

123
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,880
Do you find yourself
getting quick to anger?

124
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,480
I don't think it's a sex thing.

125
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,640
The microphone not working,

126
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,840
'cause I can tell you're thinking that,
but I don't think that's what it is.

127
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,240
- Nathan.
- I think...

128
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,960
No, I don't find myself
getting quick to anger.

129
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,320
Do you find yourself having negative
feelings about other witches?

130
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,720
Very, very occasionally, I'll have
a small negative feeling about you,

131
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,760
but I don't want you
to take it personally.

132
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,800
If you listen carefully,
can you hear my heartbeat?

133
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,320
No.

134
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,960
But are we 100% sure you've got one?

135
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,600
Forty seconds, give or take.

136
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,840
You should take this more seriously.

137
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,080
You take it seriously enough
for both of us.

138
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,680
I'll see you next month.

139
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,120
Counting the days already.

140
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,760
Class,
we have a new pupil starting today.

141
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,520
Annalise, would you stand up
and tell everyone a bit about yourself?

142
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,560
Got a pen?

143
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,040
Uh, hi, I'm Annalise.

144
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,880
My dad's work meant that my brother
and I had to change schools from London.

145
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,280
But it seems nice.

146
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,040
Yeah, I think that's it really. Hi.

147
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,720
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

148
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,160
We're all looking forward
to having you in the class. Right.

149
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,720
Today, we're going to be
looking at differential equations.

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,080
Jessica, didn't think you were invited.

156

Everyone in sixth form is crashing
your dweeby friend's party.

157
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,136
- His house is gonna get trashed.
- Okay.

158
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,280
Well, you were supposed to come
in costume though. Bit embarrassing.

159
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,600

- All right, guys. Having fun, yeah?
- Yeah.

166
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,080
Do you know them?

167
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,280
No.

168
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,320
Guys, could we just be aware
of fluids, please?

169
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,280
You know what? Next time,
maybe someone else should host the party.

170
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,200
Jack!

171
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,520
What?
Are we living under a fascist regime?

172
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,000
My dad's a tyrant.
You wouldn't understand.

173
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,960
Why don't we go to yours for a change?

174
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,720
I live in a caravan, mate.
We can fit about five people in there.

175
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,240
Well, we wouldn't know
'cause you've never invited us around.

176
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,320
- And I never will.
- Why not?

177
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,160
- I got secrets and shit, innit!
- Like what?

178
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,040
My gran's a witch.

179
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,960
- Shut up!
- It's true.

180
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,600
My whole family. We're all witches.

181
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,056
- You're not a witch. You're drunk.
- You can be both.

182
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,440
Oh, go on. Do us a spell then.

183
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,120
It's not just spells.

184
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,480
You get one power when you turn 17.

185
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,760
And only after, you get three gifts,

186
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,360
and you drink your family's blood.

187
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,600
You're fucking weird, man.
I'm worried about you.

188
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,800
No, not on my parents' bed!

189
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,840
- Shouldn't tell people that.
- What?

190
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,680
That you're a witch.

191
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,200
Nah, I was just messing about.

192
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,120
No, you weren't.

193
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,680
Yeah, I was.

194
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,760
I'm a Fairborn.

195
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,040
You weren't messing about.

196
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,440
- You're...
- Yeah.

197
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,240
- Nah.
- Yeah.

198
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,440
Fuck.

199
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,160
You're Nathan Byrne.
I'm not supposed to talk to you.

200
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,800
- Who says?
- My dad.

201
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,560
- Who's your dad?
- He's in the Council.

202
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,240
Yeah, what does he do?

203
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,000
He's chief executive
of the Fairborn Council Protection Unit.

204
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,600
- He's a Hunter?
- He's chief executive of the Hunters.

205
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,000
His work made him move down here?

206
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,800
Hey, I think that might have something
to do with you.

207
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,800
So, what's it been like...

208
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,600
...being the only witch family
in a town full of fains?

209
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,080
Just gotta keep your head down.

210
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,400
How's that going?

211
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,600
Not very well.

212
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,560
Why are you not supposed to talk to me?

213
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,280
You know why.

214
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,240
Evil dad.

215
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,520
Evil dad.

216
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,640
You seem all right.

217
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,680
Considering.

218
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,920
So, I'll see you around, yeah?

219
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,240
Maybe.

220
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,960
We can talk about how we're both witches.

221
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,840
There's no such thing as witches.

222
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,040
Wait.

223
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,880
Annalise!

224
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,560
You looking for Annalise?

225
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,760
- Yeah, do you know her?
- Uh, yeah, I think we know her.

226
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,280
Oh, shit!

227
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,880
Yeah, that's his sister.

228
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,320
And it's my cousin.

229
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,720
And we don't want you talking to her.

230
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,920
Whoa! Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, Nathan.

231
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,680
Not getting quick to anger, are you?

232
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,200
Not having negative feelings?

233
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,200
Hey, come on, bruv. What? What?

234
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,800
Oh, come on. Don't you wanna fight back?

235
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,800
Not even if I, uh...

236
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,080
Nothing?

237
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,040
Pussy!

238
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,560
You have a good night?

239
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,640
Yeah.

240
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,440
My brother's a dickhead.

241
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,080
It's fine.

242
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,760
It's not fine.

243
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,840
What if there's
a family dominant dickhead gene?

244
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,960
Like, what if I have dickhead kids?

245
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,280
Or dickhead grandkids?

246
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,960
He was right though.

247
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,760
- It's probably better if we don't...
- Want a crisp?

248
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,720
My family don't decide
who I'm friends with.

249
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,720
What about yours?

250
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,760
My family don't care who I'm friends with.

251
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,920
Well, there you go then. It's decided.

252
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,240
We can hang out.

253
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,120
Just like that?

254
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,200
Yeah.

255
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,880
How do you know I even like you?

256
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,160
'Cause I'm fucking great, mate.

257
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,760
And I'm the only witch in this school
who doesn't hate you.

258
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,800
There's no such thing as witches.

259
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,880
Yeah.

260
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,400
<i>How are you sleeping at night?</i>

261
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,800
<i>You having
negative feelings towards other witches?</i>

262
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,400
<i>Do you have fantasies about hurting...</i>

263
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,440
<i>If you listen carefully,
can you hear my heartbeat?</i>

264
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,440
<i>Do you find yourself
getting quick to anger?</i>

265
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,056
<i>Do you have violent dreams?</i>

266
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,560
<i>Do you ever have fantasies
about hurting people?</i>

267
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,960
<i>If you listen carefully,
can you hear my heartbeat?</i>

268
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,480
Do you wanna hang out on Friday?
I can sneak away.

269
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,720
- I can't. Jessica's turning 17.
- Hmm.

270
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,000
Giving ceremony.

271
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,120
Shit. I wonder what her power will be.

272
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,000
Is being a massive bitch a power?

273
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,000
Kinda.

274
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,720
Yeah. See you at lunch.

275
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,240
Nathan.

276
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,680
Niall, Kieran.

277
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,320
Remember telling you
to stay away from my sister.

278
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,480
Hmm.

279
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,440
Are we ever gonna do something
about this thing between us?

280
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,560
I mean, the tension's killing me.

281
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,240
Plus, I think
your cousin's starting to get jealous.

282
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,960
Fuck you.

283
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,120
Okay. See you later then.

284
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,040
Fucking dickhead.

285
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,680
There.

286
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,480
Jessica, on the day of your 17th birthday,

287
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,080
I give you your first gift.

288
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,080
Thanks.

289
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,080
Your second gift.

290
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,960
She really loved you, you know.

291
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,640
Your third gift.

292
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,960
Thanks, Gran.

293
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,160
Now...

294
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:32,000
Your family's blood runs through you.

295
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,120
Take of it and become whole.

296
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,560
Tilt your head back, girl.

297
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,280
It came.

298
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,000
"You have been accepted

299
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,280
into the Fairborn Council
Cadet training program."

300
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,200
You gonna be a Hunter?

301
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,120
Protecting the Fairborn community
from the Blood Witch scourge.

302
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,520
I didn't know you'd applied.

303
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,560
Just been waiting
till I was old enough.

304
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,200
You know,
I think I feel different already.

305
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,120
Stronger.

306
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,120
I was reading about
what happens to a Blood Witch

307
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,800
if they don't get their blood
when they turn 17.

308
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,080
Apparently, it's agony.

309
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,320
Apparently, they have convulsions,

310
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,720
and they start bleeding out
of their eyes and their ears,

311
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,320
and they can't stop screaming.

312
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,400
And then they die.

313
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,416
I'll take blood pouring out my eyes
if I don't have to look at you anymore.

314
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,040
Will you two stop it?

315
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,280
There are no Blood Witches here, Jessica.

316
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,040
Well, he's not a Fairborn.

317
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,560
He's gotta be something, doesn't he?

318
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,720
Yeah.

319
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,080
Who is it?

320
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,360
Nathan.

321
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,120
Mom.

322
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,680
I've come back, Nathan.

323
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,960
I wanted to tell you something.

324
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,400
I wanted to tell you...

325
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,320
that you killed me.

326
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,360
It's your fault I'm dead.

327
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,840
All your fault.

328
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,000
How dare you!

329
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,120
Your mother would be ashamed.

330
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,240
Ashamed enough
to kill herself and her two kids?

331
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,800
Apologize.

332
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,680
No.

333
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,480
So it looks like I found my power.

334
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,800
Oi, Blood Witch.

335
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,720
What you doing out here, freak?

336
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Oi.

337
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,760
I'm talking to you.

338
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,280
You think ignoring this
is gonna make it stop?

339
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,440
'Cause it's not.

340
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,040
You're a traitor, just like your mom.

341
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,360
Okay.

342
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,280
You. With me.

343
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,160
Soul O'Brien's son.

344
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,360
Of all the people to pick a fight with.

345
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,760
He picked it with me.

346
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,080
Yeah, well,
you certainly rose to the challenge.

347
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,800
Where are we going?

348
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,080
- Fairborn Council Building.
- Why?

349
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,920
Some people wanna talk with you.

350
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,840
- Why?
- Why do you think?

351
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,240
Jessica started her training.

352
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,240
She could make a great Hunter.

353
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,440
Massive hunt is definitely
what I think when I see her.

354
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,560
Your sister really hates you, doesn't she?

355
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,880
Yeah.

356
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,480
Perhaps she blames you
for your mother's death.

357
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,440
Yeah, no, I got that. Thanks.

358
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,480
Always thought this place
would be more impressive.

359
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,320
Just saying.

360
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,680
Okay.

361
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,360
What's this?

362
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,040
It's a re-creation.

363
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,800
This is the home
of Rita and Frank Applewood,

364
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,360
twelve months ago almost to the day.

365
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,080
I'm Reutger Sillwood.

366
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,320
Head of the Council of Fairborn Witches.

367
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,800
And I'm sorry
we've never met before, Nathan.

368
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,560
Though I assure you, I've been keeping
a very close eye on your development.

369
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,760
Soul O'Brien, Executive Administrator
of the Fairborn Council Protection Unit.

370
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,040
You attacked my son today.

371
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,640
He started it.

372
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,960
Did he hit you first?

373
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,440
No.

374
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,880
- Then you started it.
- He was being very fucking annoying.

375
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,920
Have you read up on
your witching history, Nathan?

376
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,520
I know Harry shags Hermione at the end.

377
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,240
Do you know
what the Blood Witches did to us?

378
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,360
Do you have any idea
what they're capable of?

379
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,360
What men like your father are capable of?

380
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,360
Ron.

381
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,280
She ends up shagging Ron.

382
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,880
That was gonna annoy me.

383
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,240
Okay, well, this was fun.

384
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,320
Thanks.

385
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,840
We need to stop
getting the disposable coffee pods.

386
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,200
- It's criminal how many we go through.
- That's you, that is.

387
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,080
I have one cup a day.

388
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,040
Not sure that's true, but okay.

389
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,360
Will you remind me
I need to ring Beth for a catch-up?

390
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,800
We cannot wait for her to call us.

391
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,680
Oh, well, like you called
your mom every weekend when at uni?

392
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,120
No, I know. I know.
She's probably working too hard.

393
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,961
- Going to the pub too hard.
- Well, I should hope not.

394
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,080
As long as she's enjoying
herself. That's the important thing.

395
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,320
- And studying, don't you think...
- Why can't we see them?

396
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,840
The spell can only trace
the history of the objects it's cast on.

397
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,280
They never found the bodies.

398
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,960
I mean, Gemma's sweet,
though I can see Aisha being...

399
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,480
What was that?

400
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,720
I don't know. Stay here.

401
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,520
- Frank.
- Wait there.

402
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,080
Be careful!

403
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,640
Can you see anything? Frank?

404
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,280
No! No, please, no!

405
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,960
Please no!

406
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,680
- Rita! Rita!
- Frank!

407
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,080
- Oh, God!
- Please!

408
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,440
- No! No, wait!
- Frank!

409
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,800
Wait!

410
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,680
No!

411
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,880
Please! Please!

412
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,880
So, who were the Applewoods then?

413
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,560
Frank Applewood was a member of the Ten.

414
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,200
The ten sitting Fairborn Council members

415
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,520
who had sworn
to find and punish your father,

416
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:42,120
Marcus Edge,
for the Wolfhagen Peace Massacre.

417
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,680
Nine of them are now dead.

418
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,440
Who's the last one left?

419
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,520
I am.

420
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,640
Do you know what happened? At Wolfhagen?

421
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,720
He killed everyone.

422
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,800
He tore them apart. Limb from limb.

423
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,800
He stole their powers and ran away.

424
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,960
No one saw him again.

425
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,040
Until ten years later,
when rumors started to spread

426
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,600
that a Fairborn woman
was pregnant with his child.

427
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,880
Rumors that turned out to be true,
of course.

428
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,360
Before the end of the year,
you'll turn 17, and you'll get your power.

429
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,800
You could just be
another normal Fairborn Witch.

430
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,280
Or you could inherit something far darker,

431
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,680
<i>far more dangerous.</i>

432
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,360
What do you think I'm going to do?
Turn 17 and start murdering people?

433
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:34,920
You're already displaying signs
of anger and violence.

434
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,840
Nathan, right now
your power lies inside you dormant.

435
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,040
It will wake.

436
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,720
And it will change you.

437
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,560
It does for every witch.

438
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,680
<i>Good... or bad.</i>

439
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,160
<i>Is it true you attacked Niall?</i>

440
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,120
Not really.

441
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,040
Sort of. I don't know.

442
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,880
Okay, wow.
Three vague answers to one question.

443
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,760
Can I assume
there's some truth to the tale,

444
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,680
or did he smash his own bike
over his head?

445
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,840
No, that was me.

446
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,520
- That was dumb.
- Yeah.

447
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,600
Should have cut the brakes off
and given it back.

448
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,520
See? You look nice,
but you're actually evil.

449
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,080
You think I look nice?

450
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,280
Shut up.

451
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,240
- You think I look nice.
- Get away from me.

452
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,080
How'd you do that?

453
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,280
Trick is to tell yourself it doesn't hurt.

454
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,480
- That's the trick, huh?
- Yeah.

455
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,800
What do you think
your power's gonna be?

456
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,640
Super strength.

457
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,320
Invisibility.

458
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,200
Turn into the Hulk when I get angry.

459
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,880
I don't know.

460
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:24,560
My dad's core power is botanical,
which could be quite nice.

461
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,320
Grow plants everywhere.

462
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,080
Mom's element's water,

463
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,960
but... I've never really seen her
do anything with it.

464
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,680
What was your mom's power?

465
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,200
She made potions.

466
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,920
Are you okay?

467
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,760
Yeah.

468
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,200
Yeah, um...

469
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,080
Yeah.

470
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,720
Good afternoon, Nathan.

471
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,200
Did you forget what day it was?

472
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,520
- How are you sleeping at night?
- Okay.

473
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,440
- Have violent dreams?
- No.

474
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,000
- You find yourself quick to anger?
- No.

475
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,800
Do you find yourself having any neg...

476
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,680
Uh...

477
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,880
Do you find yourself having negative
feelings about... about other witches?

478
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,200
No.

479
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,800
You quick to anger?

480
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,400
No.

481
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,920
Do you have fantasies
about hurting people?

482
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
No.

483
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,600
If you listen carefully,
can you hear my heartbeat?

484
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,440
No.

485
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,720
I'll see you next month.

486
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,560
Come on.

487
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,320
- Come on.
- Annalise.

488
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,560
Come on!

489
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,200
Fuck's sake.

490
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,440
Hurry up!

491
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,040
Where we going?

492
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,840
Come on, slowcoach!

493
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,640
Slow down!

494
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,840
I'm gonna prove what you are.

495
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,120
Yeah. Who am I?

496
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,520
Your father's son.

497
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,760
You okay with this?

498
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,280
Do it.

499
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,480
- I knew it.
- Doesn't mean anything.

500
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:50,680
You know exactly what it means.
Do it again.

501
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,840
Do it again.

502
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,680
Fuck.

503
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,520
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

504
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,640
Uh, what... what do we do?

505
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,520
Go home.

506
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:23,000
Jessica.

507
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,640
See, I always knew what you really were.

508
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,320
Please, help me. Please.

509
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,560
Wouldn't you rather die
than be a Blood Witch?

510
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,840
I know I would.

511
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,920
Even you can't heal that.

512
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:45,080
Please help me.

513
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,000
Fine. I'll get help.

514
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,240
Don't pull the knife out.
You'll only bleed quicker.

515
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,560
Nathan.

516
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,600
Don't speak.

517
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,680
It's okay.

518
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,640
You'll be okay.

519
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,400
Hold it.

520
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,200
Come on. Come on, love.

521
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,360
Nathan. Thank God. I...

522
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,560
Nathan!

523
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,320
Fuck, Nathan!
Have you lost your fucking mind?

524
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,360
Oh!

525
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,760
Nathan! Nathan!

526
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,440
Nathan.

527
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,080
I'm Blood.

528
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,880
I'm just like him.

529
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,240
Look at me. You are not your father.

530
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,200
Blood. Fairborn.

531
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,520
Whatever.

532
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,000
You're a good boy,

533
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,600
and you've got nothing to be ashamed of.

534
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,400
What am I gonna do?

535
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,000
They'll be coming for you,

536
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,280
and they can do what they want with you.

537
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,680
I can run.

538
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,760
You won't make it on your own.

539
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,840
There's this witch I know of.

540
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,520
Mercury.

541
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,360
God help me,
I don't wanna do this.

542
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,720
Should the time ever come
that you need it,

543
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,120
she can help.

544
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,360
Help with what?

545
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,400
Whatever's coming, Nathan.

546
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,200
Okay, so let's go and talk to her.

547
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,040
Get to it then.

548
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,120
What?

549
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,040
Start reading.

550
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,320
Gran?

551
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:17,000
She's gone for now,

552
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:20,480
Nathan Byrne, son of Marcus Edge.

553
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,280
Oh, yes, I know you,

554
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:28,480
the bastard son of the very devil himself.

555
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,560
If the stories are to be believed.

556
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:33,840
Well...

557
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:36,720
there you go.

558
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,360
You called me.

559
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,080
Why?

560
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,000
My gran said that you could help me.

561
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,440
Helping people is what I do, my dear.

562
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,360
What is it you need?

563
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,360
I don't know.

564
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,120
Perhaps you need answers.
You want to know who you are.

565
00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:00,200
You want to know
if foul blood runs through your veins.

566
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:04,720
Tell me, when do you come of age?

567
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,600
I'm 17 in ten months.

568
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:08,880
You'll be needing your family's blood.

569
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,760
- My gran will give it to me.
- Perhaps.

570
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:14,920
Perhaps not.

571
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,480
A lot can happen in ten months.

572
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,400
Can you get me to safety?

573
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,720
Mm.

574
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,160
I have a safe place.

575
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,560
Now, whether you can get there or not

576
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,320
is an entirely different question.

577
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,680
- You're a Blood Witch, aren't you?
- Takes one to know one.

578
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,680
How do I find you?

579
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,800
- What are you doing?
- Drawing a map.

580
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,200
When the time comes,

581
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,600
just call for help.

582
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,680
A map to where?

583
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:10,080
<i>You know
about the prophecy, I expect?</i>

584
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,160
No.

585
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,840
The prophecy.

586
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:16,880
The reason they've kept you alive
so long, I'd imagine.

587
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,240
<i>They hope it comes true, but if not,</i>

588
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:23,840
<i>well, they aren't sure yet what to do,</i>

589
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,680
but they are certainly worried about you.

590
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:31,640
I suppose that's why
there's so many of them outside.

591
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,040
We're moving now!

592
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:35,360
Wh... What prophecy?

593
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,640
Go, go, go!

594
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,880
Our time is almost up.

595
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:45,080
I hope I get to meet you properly
one day, Nathan Byrne,

596
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,440
but I must say,

597
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,720
the chances aren't looking that good.

598
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:54,640
Hmm.

599
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:03,400
When the time comes, just call for help.

600
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:10,120
- Hey. Wait, wait!
- Nathan Byrne!

601
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:13,760
This is the Fairborn Council.
You are surrounded.

602
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:16,360
Come out with your hands up.
