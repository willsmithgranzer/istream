1
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,120
Aoife.

2
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,240
Soul, is everything okay?

3
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,000
<i>We've heard the Bloods are on the move.</i>

4
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,600
<i>Where are you?</i>

5
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,200
We're east of Ozanne territory.

6
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,120
<i>And Marcus' boy?</i>

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
He's lost.

8
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,160
For now.

9
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,440
<i>How many of you are there?</i>

10
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,520
Eight left.

11
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,040
<i>Eight Hunters won't last long out there.
The Bloods will come for you.</i>

12
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,440
The Bloods don't scare me.

13
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,560
<i>Not anymore.</i>

14
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,600
Let them come.

15
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,280
Let him come.

16
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,000
I made it to Wolfhagen.

17
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,320
We have numbers here,
weapons and supplies.

18
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,920
We can help you.

19
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,520
Yes.

20
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,680
Let it end where it began.

21
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,440
We'll draw that coward out,

22
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,920
and he can find out what it feels like
to die far from home.

23
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,080
You don't think I'm powerful enough
to take him on.

24
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,120
I think you will be.

25
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,960
You're going to find him, aren't you?

26
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,160
I'm coming with you.

27
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,640
It'll be dangerous.

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,720
You shouldn't go on your own then.

29
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,480
Are you okay?

30
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,760
Where's Bjorn and the others?

31
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,440
Tied up in one of the sheds.

32
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,520
Are they alive?

33
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,960
Yes, of course.

34
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,120
What about the prisoners?
That boy whose Giving Day it was.

35
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,920
His grandfather was killed
trying to run away.

36
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,320
I thought maybe if I used my power,
I could turn into him.

37
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,080
Complete the ceremony somehow.

38
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,040
It was worth a shot.

39
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,200
I don't know
what we're doing here anymore.

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,200
Soul has separate orders for you.

41
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,280
He wants you to track Annalise.

42
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,880
Bring her back.

43
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,440
You can take one of the bikes.
Pick up the trail.

44
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,320
We're going to Wolfhagen.

45
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,760
Do you know where that is?

46
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,560
Bring Annalise there, quick as you can.

47
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,680
Where's Annalise?

48
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,680
Annalise!

49
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,280
Annalise!

50
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,440
You're wasting your breath.

51
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,720
She went with Ceelia.

52
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,680
How do you know?

53
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,400
I saw them leave.

54
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,640
And you didn't try and stop her?
You didn't wake me up?

55
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,040
I didn't wake you
because I knew you'd want to go after her.

56
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,960
And?

57
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,360
And in two days, you turn 17,

58
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,400
and we have seen what happens
to Blood Witches

59
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,840
who do not complete
their Giving Ceremonies, have we not?

60
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,520
Look.

61
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,200
She wanted to go. That's her business.

62
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,480
My business is still here with you.

63
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,720
Okay.

64
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,720
Then let's get this done.

65
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,680
<i>What are we gonna do
when we see my dad?</i>

66
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,360
<i>I'm gonna talk to him.</i>

67
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,240
<i>I'm gonna try and bring him back
to the Fairborn Council.</i>

68
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,680
<i>By force, if I have to.</i>

69
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,560
<i>Do you think
you can do that all on your own?</i>

70
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,360
<i>I'm not on my own, am I?</i>

71
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,640
I've got you.

72
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,400
What's on your mind?

73
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,120
You're gonna think it's stupid.

74
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,200
Try me.

75
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,440
Okay.

76
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,040
It just feels like

77
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,120
I'm losing something that,

78
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,160
I don't know,
might not even really be mine to lose.

79
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,080
Like, I'm holding on to something

80
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,480
that might not even be a thing.

81
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,640
- You're talking about Nathan.
- Yeah.

82
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,720
We'll see him again.

83
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,960
Well, you don't know that for sure.

84
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,720
No, I don't.

85
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,000
Well, I just always thought
in the end, it'd be me and him.

86
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,720
This is so stupid, isn't it?

87
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,680
No.

88
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,280
I was six foot by the age of 13.

89
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,320
Bigger and stronger than all the kids
and most of the teachers too.

90
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,240
I used to slouch down to talk to people,

91
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,840
skip lunch to avoid bulking up.

92
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,280
And I was certain...

93
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,360
certain...

94
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,400
that I was gonna spend
the rest of my life alone.

95
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,360
But there were men and women,

96
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,360
friends and lovers,

97
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,720
and with time...

98
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,360
I started to fit into my own skin.

99
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,400
Thinking about the people
that you love isn't stupid.

100
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,560
It isn't trivial. It isn't a distraction.

101
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,040
It's the whole thing.

102
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,480
It's the whole fucking point
of everything.

103
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,440
Okay.

104
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,480
Thanks.

105
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,280
I just can't believe she'd leave
without saying goodbye.

106
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,200
She has her path, and you have yours.

107
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,360
You both have to walk them.

108
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,680
What are you,
fucking Yoda now or something?

109
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,920
Who?

110
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,760
Oh.

111
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,720
Jesus Christ. Don't worry.

112
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,280
I miss being on the boat.

113
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,960
Less walking on the boat.

114
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,680
Less complaining too.

115
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,440
Do you wanna hear
my <i>Lord of the Rings </i>theory?

116
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,960
Sure.

117
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,400
Okay, so <i>Lord of the Rings</i>, right,

118
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,480
it's these movies about this little fella
who gets obsessed with a ring.

119
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,800
- Yeah, I know what <i>Lord of the Rings</i> is.
- You didn't know who Yoda was.

120
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,880
Just tell me your theory.

121
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,880
Like, well... well, the Fellowship, right?

122
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,800
Mm-hmm.

123
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,360
All the hobbits and the elf
and the dwarf and everyone,

124
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,520
they go on this big quest,
and they get into mad fights with orcs,

125
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,720
and they're having battles,
adventures and shit, yeah?

126
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,920
Yeah.

127
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,040
Well, the whole time
they're always saying, "Ahh!"

128
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,896
"Won't it be great when we finish
this journey, and everything's nice,"

129
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,240
"and there's no more orcs to fight?"

130
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,720
Right.

131
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,160
But it seems like fighting orcs

132
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,800
and going on adventures
is what they like to do.

133
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,480
Like, take away all that

134
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,920
and they're just no one, really.

135
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,800
Like, they don't really
wanna throw away the ring,

136
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,440
because once they've done that,
they've all gotta go home.

137
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,920
All the fun's over.
The happy ending ain't that happy.

138
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,080
Frodo don't get to hang out
with his mates anymore.

139
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,160
He's just sat around jerking off
in the shire

140
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,600
thinking about all the funny shit
Gimli used to do.

141
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,040
You know, actually,
I'm not sure I have seen this film.

142
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,880
I mean, you get my point, right?

143
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,600
Like, even if something seems bad
at the time,

144
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,600
maybe it wasn't.

145
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,760
Maybe the bad times
were actually the good times.

146
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,360
It's a good theory.

147
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,880
The guard...

148
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,520
Shit.

149
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,400
Their hearts have been taken.

150
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,080
- Get Alice.
- Nicky.

151
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,160
Get her.

152
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,600
A necromancer.

153
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,360
Open to rest,
my brother, bring us your spirit.

154
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,600
Bring us your spirit,
my brother, and bring it quickly.

155
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,240
Open to rest,
my brother, bring us your spirit.

156
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,240
Bring us your spirit,
my brother, and bring it quickly.

157
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,480
<i>What have you done?</i>

158
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,840
<i>What was necessary.</i>

159
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,960
Brother.

160
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,680
What did you hear in the darkness?

161
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,040
Screaming, crying.

162
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,320
Pain and fear.

163
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,800
That was you, brother.

164
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,480
What about after?

165
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,320
When the shadows came?

166
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,920
What did they say?

167
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,400
Wolfhagen.

168
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,640
Is this it?

169
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,720
Yeah.

170
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,720
Doesn't look like much.

171
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,520
That's the point.

172
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,800
How does it work then?

173
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,400
Think of it like a train station.

174
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,080
Just have to find our platform.

175
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,880
Aw, now we're talking.

176
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,720
Mmm.

177
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,160
Where do you think
Annalise and Ceelia are?

178
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,880
No way of knowing.

179
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,760
Just asking what you think.

180
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,040
I think there's no way of knowing.

181
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,440
You want one?

182
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,480
Gotta say though, I think...

183
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,320
Is this supposed to happen?

184
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,360
Yep.

185
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,400
Jesus.

186
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,520
So we can go anywhere in the world?

187
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,720
If it has a Cut, yeah.

188
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,480
The number there matches the number here.

189
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,960
Uh, there's Mercury, 11.

190
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,760
The tower we passed on the way in.

191
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,720
And look, here. The one for Paris.

192
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,040
Shall we go back to the bar
for a quick drink?

193
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,680
It's tempting.

194
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,240
What's that?

195
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,840
Hey, Nathan. Don't go out there.

196
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,440
I'm gonna take a look.

197
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,960
We are trying to help you.

198
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,320
Nathan, wait!

199
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,000
He wasn't attacking me.

200
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,640
It's Jessica.

201
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,200
She wants...

202
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,736
- She wants... She wants...
- What?

203
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,440
What? What? What is it?

204
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,720
She wants to hurt

205
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,600
Annalise.

206
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,880
Don't...

207
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,920
Don't go...

208
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,760
Go.

209
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,000
"Don't go"? Don't go where?

210
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,560
Wolf.

211
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,920
I...

212
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,000
I... I, uh,

213
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,520
I just wanted to do something good.

214
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,360
No.

215
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,600
No, no, no, no, no.

216
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:29,720
Stop. Stop. Stop it.

217
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,560
Stop it! It's done. Okay?

218
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,560
It's done.

219
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,800
I killed him.

220
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,440
What was he trying to say?

221
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,680
He said Jessica wanted Annalise.

222
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,320
He said, "Annalise, don't go wolf."

223
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,400
She's in trouble.

224
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,640
Yeah, wolf.

225
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,240
- Maybe he was talking about your father.
- No.

226
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,560
He wasn't.

227
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,320
He was. He was called Beef.

228
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,800
And he was
my brother's friend's... brother's?

229
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,880
Yeah, and they didn't want him anymore,

230
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,600
so I swapped him for an old iPhone 8,
because I was getting a new one.

231
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,120
And my mom went absolutely mad

232
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,680
when I brought him home.

233
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,160
Aw, I taught him how to stand
on his two legs and eat grapes.

234
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,560
I didn't even know that rats liked grapes.

235
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,480
And then you exploded him?

236
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,960
- Yeah.
- RIP Beef.

237
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,920
RIP Beef.

238
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,040
- Uh, what are you doing?
- Get out of the car.

239
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,960
Ceelia.

240
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,640
- Do you speak French?
- Not enough to carjack someone.

241
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,800
No!
What the hell are you doing?

242
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,600
I don't regret anything.

243
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,640
Your car.

244
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,480
Let's go.

245
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,696
- That's stealing.
- Sorry. Sorry.

246
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,560
What?

247
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,640
Go. <i>Pardon!</i>

248
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,080
We're sorry!

249
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,640
This is incredible what's happening!

250
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,480
Okay, I feel really guilty.

251
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,640
If that's the worst thing you end up
doing today, then count yourself lucky.

252
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,840
Here.

253
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,480
Call your dad. Find out where he is.

254
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,520
I don't know if I can.

255
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,120
Just keep it neutral.

256
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,520
Find out where he is.

257
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,920
We need to refuel.

258
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,040
Make it quick.

259
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,120
Watch the road!

260
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,400
Fuel up. Five minutes.

261
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,040
<i>Dad, it's me.</i>

262
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,440
Annalise, where are you?
Are you... Are you okay?

263
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,800
<i>Yeah, I'm on the road.
We need to talk.</i>

264
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,760
<i>Where are you?</i>

265
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,480
Getting somewhere secure.
Is... Is Kieran with you?

266
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,960
Kieran, no. I'm with, uh...

267
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,560
I'm... by myself.

268
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,680
I need you to get to me right now.
It's not safe out there.

269
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,440
<i>Yeah, I will. I'm coming.
Just tell me where you are.</i>

270
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,920
It's a Fairborn stronghold
called Wolfhagen.

271
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,400
- We'll be there by this evening.
<i>- Wolfhagen? What is...</i>

272
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,520
Let's go!

273
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,280
Let's go, move it. I said let's go.

274
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,880
Ceelia told me
about this place. Wolfhagen.

275
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,640
It's where my father...
It's where the Peace Massacre happened.

276
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,240
She's walking into danger.
We have to go help her.

277
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,800
We don't have time, Nathan.

278
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,800
- It's right there.
- We have one day, okay?

279
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,720
So we're going to go to Mercury.
We're going to get your blood,

280
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,160
and we're going to save your life,
and that's final.

281
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,760
What if it's not worth saving?

282
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,320
It is to me.

283
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,280
Got it. Cheers.

284
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,960
Where's the Cut?

285
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,960
It's out there.

286
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,040
Fucking hell.

287
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,360
On three?

288
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Hey, look at me.

289
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,160
You can do this, okay?

290
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,760
Sometimes the bad times
are the good times.

291
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,840
Remember?

292
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,760
Yeah.

293
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,840
I'm sorry.

294
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,880
You stupid idiot.

295
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,480
Nice.

296
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,640
Please be right.

297
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,320
Oh, shit.

298
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,080
Oi!

299
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,320
Okay. All right.

300
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,680
We must be close now.

301
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,000
We'll be there by nightfall.

302
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,720
What is it?

303
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,760
Two Fairborns. Close.

304
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,560
Go.

305
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,496
When we get there,
will you let me speak to him first?

306
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,560
Before you, you know,
start punching people.

307
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,160
I don't know.

308
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,280
I think he'll listen to me.

309
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,600
I reckon I can reason with him.
Whatever happens, I'm still his daughter.

310
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,680
He's still my dad.

311
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,280
Oh, my God!

312
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,600
Oh, my God!

313
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,896
Come on!

314
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,240
Oh, my God!

315
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,000
- Oh, God!
- Oh, my God! Ceelia!

316
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,560
Annalise, drive! Go!

317
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,000
Fuck you, Robin Hood,
and your merry band of cunts.

318
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,080
No welcome party?

319
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,200
Speech is silver. Silence is golden.

320
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,400
Yeah.

321
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,480
In a house of gold,
the clocks are of lead.

322
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,320
Weren't you going to say hello?

323
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,720
So...

324
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,640
Where is he?

325
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,960
He didn't come.

326
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,360
Oh, now, that is a shame.

327
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,200
He needs that. He'll die without it.

328
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,680
But I was very clear
he was to be brought to me.

329
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,480
Let me take it to him.

330
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,880
Oh, Gabriel.

331
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,000
You're smitten.

332
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,880
Where has he gone to?

333
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,760
Wolfhagen.

334
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,960
Wolfhagen?

335
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,800
Not sure that's a place
anybody wants to be right now.

336
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,480
Far as I understand it,

337
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,720
there's rather a lot of trouble brewing.

338
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,840
The fires have started burning.

339
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:58,680
And when those fires start burning,
they must be fed.

340
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,760
Lest they go out.

341
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,320
Where is everyone?

342
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,240
Maeve.

343
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,776
Hey!

344
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,080
<i>Please. Please. I didn't want to do it.</i>

345
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,960
<i>I... I said we should just punish her.
We were told.</i>

346
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,680
<i>We had no choice.</i>

347
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,400
Soul, maybe we sh...

348
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,280
<i>Get him here.</i>

349
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,880
<i>Just give me a minute, please.</i>

350
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,400
<i>Aoife.</i>

351
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,880
<i>Soul, is everything okay?</i>

352
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:48,200
<i>We've heard the Bloods are on the move.
Where are you?</i>

353
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:52,480
<i>- We're east of Ozanne territory.
- And Marcus' boy?</i>

354
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,400
<i>He's lost. For now.</i>

355
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,040
<i>- How many of you are there?
- Eight left.</i>

356
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,920
<i>Eight Hunters won't last long.
The Bloods will come for you.</i>

357
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,936
<i>Bloods don't scare me.</i>

358
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,680
<i>Not anymore. Let them come.</i>

359
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,640
- Enough. Enough!
<i>- Let him come.</i>

360
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,960
We should get out of here.

361
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,080
Silence!

362
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,480
Such a shame.

363
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,720
He was so full of potential.

364
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,320
All lost now.

365
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,720
Give me the blood
and I can bring him back here.

366
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:14,240
Oh, my darling angel Gabriel.

367
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,880
So hard to say no to such perfection.

368
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,600
You must tell me.

369
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,120
Is it love?

370
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,520
No!

371
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,080
Wait.

372
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,640
Wait.

373
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,920
Oh, that. Um, that's nothing.
I'll take that for you.

374
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,960
What was I...

375
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,520
You were going to bed, my dove.

376
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,640
You've come such a long way.

377
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,040
And you're so very tired.

378
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,120
Gabriel.

379
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,920
I so miss you when you're gone.

380
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,920
Will you promise to stay awhile?

381
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,800
That's my beautiful boy.

382
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,840
Hello, Nathan.

383
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,760
Dad.

384
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,040
Annalise.

385
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,080
What are you doing here?

386
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:26,080
- What do you mean? You told me to come.
- No!

387
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,160
No.

388
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,160
You shouldn't have come.

389
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,480
Dad?

390
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,280
He's here.

391
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,680
You shouldn't have come.
