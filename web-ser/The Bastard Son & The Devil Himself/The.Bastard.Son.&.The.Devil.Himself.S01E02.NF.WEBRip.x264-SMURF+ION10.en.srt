1
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,520
Nathan Byrne!

2
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,240
- This is the Fairborn Council!
- Nathan!

3
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,880
You are surrounded.
Come out with your hands up!

4
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,896
You are a Blood Witch, Nathan.

5
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,440
By the laws of this land,

6
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,560
you're not permitted
to live within British borders.

7
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,560
So, what you saying? Gonna kill him?

8
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,120
No.

9
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,880
My family's power line is visions.

10
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,680
My mother, she was a prophet
and a far more powerful witch than me.

11
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,600
She wrote something on her last night.

12
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,160
The same night you were born.

13
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,000
"His own blood will kill the wolf."

14
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,080
A prophecy.

15
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,400
So, no,
I'm not going to execute you, Nathan.

16
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,360
I'm going to train you

17
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,360
because I believe
you are destined to fight your father.

18
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,880
What if I say no?

19
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,360
This is ridiculous! You can't take him.

20
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,240
He's only 16. He belongs here with me.

21
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,520
It's okay, Gran. I'll be back. I promise.
Will you tell Annalise what's going on?

22
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,656
I think we can both agree it'd be best
for my daughter to be kept out of this.

23
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,080
Okay, good. Let's go.

24
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,160
Nathan secured.

25
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,000
They train us
to kill Blood Witches.

26
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,720
But you...

27
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,680
They want us to take you up north,
keep you safe.

28
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,640
And we will.

29
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,640
After this.

30
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,040
- Right, over here.
- Right, let's go.

31
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,200
We'll get your dad one day,
but this will do for now.

32
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,920
Come on then!

33
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,400
You'll do, eh?

34
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,960
<i>♪ Do what I do, it's what I feel... ♪</i>

35

54
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,600
So, is there like
a Wi-Fi password or something?

55
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,360
No.

56
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,200
Whoa.

57
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,520
That smells disgusting.

58
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,080
What we doing here really?

59
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,040
I'm going to train you
to fight your father.

60
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,080
I don't expect, if you ever meet him,

61
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,920
that my training will keep you alive
for long, but those are my orders,

62
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,760
so that's what I'm going to do,

63
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,280
and you're going to comply
because if you don't,

64
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,320
then you're just another Blood Witch
in a land that doesn't want you.

65
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,920
I'm not a Blood Witch.

66
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,640
Fuck you. I'm not.

67
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,640
Then what are you, Nathan?

68
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,280
I don't know.

69
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,520
Well, we're going to find out.

70
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,280
Where's my bedroom?

71
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,720
- Is this a joke?
- Cottage isn't big enough for both of us.

72
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,120
- No shit. Look at the fucking size of you.
- This isn't a holiday camp. Toughen up.

73
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,320
Never actually been to a holiday camp.

74
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,040
Well, you won't know what you're missing.

75
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,720
Throw your stuff in.
Training starts right away.

76
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,000
We've got ten months
till you get your powers.

77
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,680
Until then, you have your mind,
and you have your body,

78
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,520
and we can turn
both of those things into weapons.

79
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,840
I can already fight.

80
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,680
- How did you do earlier?
- Not fair. There was more of them than me.

81
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,440
So you can only win fair fights?
That's not gonna be much use to us.

82
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,480
No one can beat eight hunters
on their own.

83
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,760
No one has fought your father and lived.

84
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,880
Our purpose here is
to make the impossible possible.

85
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:01,040
Hey, if you can teach me to
kick the shit out of eight of you fuckers,

86
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,120
then I'm all ears.

87
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,680
Let's see how you get on
against one for now, yeah?

88
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,200
Hmm.

89
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,880
- You have terrible technique.
- Fuck!

90
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,360
Mind and body, Nathan Byrne.

91
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,880
Mind and body.

92
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,000
How's the training going?
Is Kieran looking after you?

93
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,840
Yes, he's been good to me.

94
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,280
The program's tough.
They work us very hard.

95
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,200
Yes, we do.

96
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,480
How are the other cadets treating you?

97
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,760
There's been some comments.

98
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,440
My association with Nathan and...

99
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,680
And Marcus.

100
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,840
Yes.

101
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,280
You can't help that.

102
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,200
No, but it hangs around my neck anyway.

103
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,360
Well, we all have our baggage.

104
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,760
Not like this.

105
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,440
I was one of the architects
of the peace talks.

106
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,520
You may have heard them referred to
by their more common title,

107
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,160
the Peace Massacre.

108
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,120
There were many who are skeptical about
meeting the Bloods to discuss a truce.

109
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,840
I thought we could do
something incredible.

110
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,320
I thought we could change the world.

111
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,440
But Marcus Edge had other ideas.

112
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,760
I didn't realize. I'm sorry.

113
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,000
Whatever good I do, whatever I achieve,

114
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,360
I'll always be the man
who invited the wolf into our home.

115
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,400
You're a cadet in the armed wing
of the Fairborn Council.

116
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,960
If the past hangs around your neck,

117
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,120
pull it off.

118
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,040
This is your time
to define who you really are.

119
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,760
Ho, Nuno!

120
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,040
The objective of combat training
is to improve our skills,

121
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,960
not cripple our partners.

122
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,040
Go again.

123
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,240
The shadow of the wolf
spreads over Europe.

124
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:41,640
You are the first line of defense
for the Fairborn community.

125
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,800
So, you need to know your enemy.

126
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,800
Blood Witches heal
ten times quicker than Fairborns.

127
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,200
We use standard nine-millimeter bullets,
infused with composite spell formula

128
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,480
to bypass
their natural remedial capabilities.

129
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,640
Hands up, whose core power is elixir?

130
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,640
Great. So, you might know better than me
what the fuck's in these things.

131
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,920
What I can tell you is

132
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,760
if you hit a Blood with one,
they will know about it.

133
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,600
They're not superhuman.

134
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,080
We've killed a lot of them,
and we'll kill a lot more.

135
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,680
Magic bullets.

136
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,120
No one calls them that.

137
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,920
Ow!

138
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,160
Fucking hell, man. Fucking hurt.

139
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,160
Right, there's a natural circuit,
a five-mile run

140
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,800
if you follow the path.

141
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,720
I'll be timing you.

142
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,240
Not very fast.

143
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,080
- Do it again.
- What?

144
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,720
Come on!

145
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,040
Nathan!

146
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,560
<i>I don't know why
they don't leave you alone.</i>

147
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,160
What if they're right though?

148
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,280
What if I'm a...

149
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,400
fucking Blood Witch?

150
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,040
Nathan. You might be a Blood Witch.

151
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,240
Or you might not be.

152
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,520
One thing you're not is your dad.

153
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,440
When your brother
was trying to provoke me, I...

154
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,800
I wanted to hurt him.

155
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,920
I wanted to really hurt him.

156
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,040
Yeah.

157
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,440
That... That's what being provoked means.

158
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,640
Look, have you ever been into town
on a Friday night?

159
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,120
Moments of blind rage
are not unique to Blood Witches.

160
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,720
They're not unique to your father,

161
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,480
and they're not unique to you.

162
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,080
Honestly, just stop
feeling sorry for yourself.

163
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,960
It is your least attractive quality.

164
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,240
You think I have attractive qualities?

165
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,640
Shut up.

166
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,040
Hello, Ms. Byrne.

167
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,720
- I'm looking for Nathan. He...
- He's gone, love.

168
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,920
Gone where?

169
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,640
That's not your concern.

170
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,520
But I... I am concerned...

171
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,360
You're a smart girl, Annalise.

172
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,320
Don't come back here.

173
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,840
Get on with your life.

174
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,360
<i>Go.</i>

175
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,360
Breathe.

176
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,160
<i>Focus!</i>

177
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,520
Focus.

178
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,000
Don't point the gun at me!

179
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,560
Fucking breathe, please!

180
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,960
Jessica, must do better.

181
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,120
You know, with a few more weeks
training, you might even hit the target.

182
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,840
Hope we don't
get sent out together before then.

183
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,080
I hit the target plenty of times.

184
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:13,080
We're meant to be the best of the best,
so plenty of times don't really cut it.

185
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,360
Did your stepdad not teach you
how to kill properly?

186
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,440
I never met him.

187
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,200
Ah, well, you were only little.

188
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,800
Probably just don't remember.

189
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,760
Maybe he tucked you into bed
before getting in with your mom.

190
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,520
Your power
is shape-shifting, right?

191
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,120
So why don't you try and shift into
someone who's not a fucking traitor?

192
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,400
Okay, screw you.

193
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,760
- Oh!
- What?

194
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,560
Do I look like a traitor now?

195
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,440
Stop it.

196
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,040
Oh, don't be ashamed.

197
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,720
I think you look great.

198
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,520
I mean your boyfriend must be thrilled.
Couldn't believe...

199
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,840
His luck.

200
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,320
Oh, yeah, he's definitely
punching above his weight.

201
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,000
Oh,
no wonder you seem so frustrated.

202
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:08,960
Stop it now.

203
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,480
The next time you're alone with him,
you're gonna have that thought in mind.

204
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,240
What if it's not really him?

205
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,360
What if he suddenly...

206
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,080
changes?

207
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,040
Jesus Christ.

208
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,200
You wanna talk about daddy issues?

209
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,280
I can give you daddy issues.

210
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,800
You are fucking sick.

211
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,280
There is something wrong with you.

212
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,200
Change back now.

213
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,280
Hmm.

214
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,120
I hit the target plenty of times.

215
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,600
And I'll hit it plenty more.

216
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,240

221
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,840
Hey, I just wanted to come and make sure
that you're, you know, doing all right.

222
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,520
I'm doing fine.

223
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:26,000
So the whole Hazel situation...

224
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,520
She was... She was pretty upset.

225
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,560
So?

226
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,280
So maybe you could try
and smooth things over,

227
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,880
you know, for the good of the team?

228
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,240
As you've seen, my door's unlocked.
She's welcome to come and apologize.

229
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,240
Look, I know Hazel can be a bit difficult.

230
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,080
- But that's part of working...
- Kieran.

231
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,240
Your dad is a respected member
of the Fairborn community.

232
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,920
Your uncle is
head of the Fairborn Council Task Force.

233
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,320
Your whole life has been one
of privilege and ease.

234
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,200
Jess, I worked hard to get in here.

235
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,520
You passed a bleep test to get in here.

236
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,960
I worked hard.

237
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,920
My dad's dead.

238
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,720
And my name will always be stained
by association with a monster.

239
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,880
If I let them,
people will use that to tear me down.

240
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,760
They've been doing it my entire life.

241
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,760
So, she can come and apologize,
and I might let it go.

242
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,880
I don't show weakness, Kieran.

243
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,520
Some of us weren't born that lucky.

244
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,800
All right, I... I just wanted
to come make sure that you were...

245
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,760
you were okay, but I'll leave you to it.

246
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,240
You don't have to go
just 'cause I snapped at you.

247
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,080
You can stay.

248
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,520
If you want.

253
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,680
I wanna call someone.

254
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,720
Who?

255
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,400
Annalise.

256
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,480
There's no phone reception here.

257
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,000
Why don't you draw yourself
a little picture?

258
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,280
- Give that back.
- No.

259
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,080
You know what?

260
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,840
Fuck you! Fuck your stew,
fuck this cottage, fuck training!

261
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,040
I want to go home.

262
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,600
Okay.

263
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,760
You can go home.

264
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,560
All you have to do is pick up this book.

265
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,080
Fuck! Fuck!

266
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,960
Clean up your mess.

267
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,120
<i>You're running the track.</i>

268
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,360
Run it again.

269
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,160
Run it... again.

270
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,960
<i>You're Nathan Byrne</i>.

271
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,280
<i>I'm not supposed to talk to you,</i>

272
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,480
but you seem all right...

273
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,240
considering.

274
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,160
You look just like him, you know.

275
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,840
Bjorn, what's going on?

276
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,240
We got a distress call
from a Council member in Wales.

277
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,000
We think it's Bloods.
Could be Marcus himself.

278
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,480
- Don't we have people stationed in Wales?
- We do.

279
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,840
Then why are we going?

280
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,000
Because our people went
to investigate

281
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,400
and now we can't get hold of 'em.

282
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,256
- Why don't we just call them?
- Into the truck.

283
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,200
Let's go!

284
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,800
- Let's go, we're moving now!
- All right!

285
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,736
<i>Hold position
until further notice.</i>

286
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,760
All right!

287
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,880
Go. Go quickly.
Positions now, mate.

288
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,880
Hold, hold, hold.

289
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,280
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

290
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,120
Help! Help me!

291
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,960
Don't touch her.

292
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,280
God, Jesus.

293
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,320
Suffocation curses are fast-acting.
They'll still be close.

294
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,920
Wait!

295
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,480
Oh, fuck's sake.

296
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,000
Looks like we found the first team.

297
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,720
This is Team Leader requesting
backup units on site.

298
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,296
We're gonna need a cleanup team as well.

299
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,840
- What about the bodies?
- They'll torch the house.

300
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,080
Unless you think
you can explain ten corpses

301
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,200
and a woman without a mouth to the fains.

302
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,960
- Pick up anything?
- Hmm.

303
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,680
They went this way.

304
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,600
Annalise, on the day
of your 17th birthday,

305
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,720
I give you your first gift.

306
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,120
Thank you.

307
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,600
I give you your second gift.

308
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,200
I give you your third gift.

309
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,040
This was my father's.

310
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,120
Then it was mine.

311
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,240
Now it's yours.

312
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,640
If your brother asks,
tell him I got it off eBay.

313
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,440
Thank you. It's beautiful.

314
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,520
All right.

315
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,280
You ready?

316
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,080
And now,

317
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,840
your family's blood runs through you.

318
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,520
Take of it and become whole.

319
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,800
Well done!

320
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,200
- Well done. Well done.
- Thanks, Dad.

321
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,120
When it was my giving ceremony,
your father was so jealous

322
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,280
that, uh...

323
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,240
...he tried
to cut his own finger all by himself.

324
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,480
We've sent everyone we have
over there as backup.

325
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,920
How did they manage
to take out an entire squad?

326
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,240
A whole squad of hunters.

327
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,280
- I don't know.
- Was he with them?

328
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,120
Marcus?

329
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,880
It's unlikely.

330
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,920
I mean, it's not like she was one of the...

331
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,880
Not like she was one of the Ten.

332
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,800
It should be the 12.

333
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,160
He spent the last two decades
hunting down the ten that gave the order.

334
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,560
What do you think he's gonna do

335
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,760
when he finds out that
the two of us actually carried it out?

336
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,840
You're both safe.

337
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,080
Your identities will die with me.

338
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,960
Whenever the day comes.

339
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:43,440
Well, either way,
I doubt he was there.

340
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,600
Her heart was still in her chest,
for one thing.

341
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,840
I mean,
that's usually a pretty big giveaway.

342
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,360
Hey, um,
Dad, Mom wants us to cut the cake.

343
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,360
Oh. Yes, of course, love.

344
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,920
Beautiful ceremony, Annalise.

345
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,760
Soul, your daughter
really is quite charming.

346
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,280
What's the point?

347
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,800
I'm never gonna beat him in a fight.
What's the fucking point?

348
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,600
A month ago, you wouldn't
have been able to do that.

349
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,200
Imagine what
you'll be able to do next month.

350
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,480
<i>Hey, Beef.</i>

351
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,720
<i>Giving Day today.</i>

352
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,240
What do you think my power's gonna be?

353
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,080
Maybe I can make animals talk.

354
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,120
Speak. Speak.

355
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,640
Fine,

356
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,720
be like that.

357
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,760
Strong, quiet type.

358
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,800
I thought he might have written.

359
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,160
Being my birthday and all.

360
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,240
Wouldn't kill him, would it?

361
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,640
Just a little letter...

362
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,480
...just to say hello.

363
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,560
"I'm still alive."

364
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,240
Speak.

365
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,040
Okay. Yeah, you're not gonna do it.

366
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,360
See you later, pal.

367
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:21,440
<i>♪ ...after dark, it's my point of view... ♪</i>

368
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,560
Annalise, it's your turn.

369
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,920
<i>♪ Always coming
And you'd never have a clue ♪</i>

370
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,680

371
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,400
Oh! One!

372
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,760
Hey, I got you something.

373
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,600
It's a puppy.

374
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,600
Okay.

375
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,240
Hope he's still alive.

376
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:47,120
Right. You might've wanted to put
some air holes in here or something.

377
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,840
- Because you always...
- Always smash my phone.

378
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,760
You're on here.

379
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,720
Well, I wanted to make sure
you remembered me.

380
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,320
Thank you.

381
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,160
Really.

382
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,840
You know,
you really are strikingly beautiful.

383
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
That's a bowling pun.

384
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,560
Thank you.

385
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,040
You have very heavy balls.

386
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,400
It's also a bowling pun.
It's the best I could think of. Sorry.

387
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,640
- Just gonna...
- That was cringe.

388
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,000
That was fun. You are terrible at bowling.

389
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,200
Shut up! I've never done it without the...

390
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:51,000
Oh, my God, what are they called?
The sausages down the sides.

391
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,680
The gutter guards.

392
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:56,440
Okay, well we professional bowlers
like to call them sausages, but okay.

393
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,440
I was thinking about, you know,

394
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,160
what happened last time
we were in this car.

395
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,480
Yeah.

396
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,480
I remember.

397
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,960
It was fun.

398
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,200
We should do that again.

399
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,280
Yeah, it... it was nice.

400
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,600
But?

401
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,760
Uh...

402
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,000
I... I don't know. I...

403
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,640
I don't really know what I want right now.

404
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,600
It seemed like you did
when we were together.

405
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,720
Sorry.

406
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,400
David.

407
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,080
David. David!

408
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,920
What are you doing?

409
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,720
Make it stop!

410
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,080
The trail ends here.

411
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,080
Four teams. Close the square.

412
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,960
First team on Jessica.
Third team on Kieran.

413
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:33,280
Fourth with Flo. Second on me.

414
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,040
No one gets away.

415
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,720
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

416
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,400
Left, to the left!

417
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,120
I got here too late.

418
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,040
Annalise.

419
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,440
Oh, my head.

420
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,520
You were in a car accident.

421
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:24,880
Where's David?

422
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,280
He's down the hall.

423
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,240
He was pretty badly hurt.

424
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,520
Is he gonna be okay?

425
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,120
He's gonna be fine.

426
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,320
Do you remember what happened?

427
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,760
Make it stop!

428
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,720
Not really.

429
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,280
Well, the most important thing is
you're okay.

430
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,440
Sorry, have to go.

431
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,560
I'll be back later with some magazines

432
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,880
and those horrible chocolates you like.

433
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,520
See you later.

434
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,800
Sir, we got them.

435
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,920
Excellent. Good work.

436
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,840
<i>I'm afraid we suffered some casualties.
One of the new recruits.</i>

437
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,640
Not Jessica?

438
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,200
No, uh, Cadet Hazel Clark.

439
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,800
Okay, I'm gonna see Reutger now,
give her the good news in person.

440
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,760
Well done.

441
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,120
- Aoife.
- I came as soon as...

442
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,360
It's Marcus.

443
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,360
Where were the guards?

444
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,360
We found
a few bits of them in the garden.

445
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,880
There was an insurgency in Wales.

446
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,640
We sent most
of our local protection detail there.

447
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,880
You think it was a diversion?

448
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,160
If it was, it worked.

449
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,600
The last of the Ten.

450
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,240
Are we safe?

451
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,520
- Seven of her fingers are broken.
- What does that mean?

452
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,640
It means that's how long it took
before she gave us up.

453
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,776
- He knows about us. We have to run.
- I'm not running.

454
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,280
My power is illumination.
Yours is growing bloody plants.

455
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,840
If the head of the council wasn't safe,
what chance do we have?

456
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:28,040
We're not as... powerless as...
as you might think.

457
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,760
There are ways.

458
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,040
What ways?

459
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,880
No, it's... Yeah, sorry,
you should... you should go. It's...

460
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,720
It's not safe
for you here anymore.

461
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,120
One mistake and a life spent
looking over our shoulders.

462
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,560
We were just following orders.

463
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,880
Yeah, well, now they're following us.

464
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,320
"His own blood will kill the wolf."

465
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,560
The boy.

466
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,120
If Marcus knows about the prophecy now...

467
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,800
he'll be after him too.

468
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,120
What's going on?

469
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,040
Reutger Sillwood is dead.

470
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,320
It was your dad.

471
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,440
- So what are they doing here?
- Been ordered to provide extra protection.

472
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,920
There's a concern
that your father may believe

473
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,360
that you're a danger to him now.

474
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,520
He may come here looking for you.

475
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,680
- How's training going, sunshine?
- Fine. You wanna fucking fight?

476
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,720
Come on, mate.

477
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,560
Okay, happy to.

478
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,400
Right.

479
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,840
It reflects poorly on me
when you get beaten so easily.

480
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,120
Well, maybe
you should train me better then.

481
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,560
Do you think
my dad's really on his way here?

482
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,400
I have no idea what your father's doing.

483
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,880
Maybe he'll come to rescue me.

484
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,920
He wouldn't be coming to rescue you.

485
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,000
- You learned a new recipe.
- Hmm. Fill my time somehow.

486
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,640
Thought you filled your time
beating the crap out of me. Cutlery.

487
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,640
That's the days.
The nights I have nothing to do.

488
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,520
- Try sleeping.
- I don't sleep.

489
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,600
Why not?

490
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,240
Bad dreams.

491
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,160
Maybe you should, like,
listen to a whale song or something.

492
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,520
Thanks for the tip.

493
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,920
You said I look just like him.

494
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,800
What?

495
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,240
My dad.

496
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,280
You said that I look just like him.

497
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,880
So you must have seen him then.

498
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,680
I was 11.

499
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,040
My parents both worked
for the Fairborn Council.

500
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,160
They were called
to a very important meeting.

501
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,000
To discuss peace.

502
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,200
The massacre.

503
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,200
They were excited to bring me along.

504
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,000
Told me I was going to witness history.

505
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,960
Well, they weren't wrong.

506
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,920
It was an old house called Wolfhagen,

507
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,920
in Germany.

508
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,600
Neutral territory.

509
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,640
My mother carried me in.

510
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,000
She put me in a chair
at the back of the hall

511
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,680
and told me to be very quiet.

512
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,640
I remember him coming in.

513
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,520
The way he looked at everyone.

514
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,280
And smiled.

515
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,800
Then he turned.

516
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,240
He became the wolf.

517
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,240
And he killed every one of them.

518
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,480
What did you do?

519
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:51,760
I hid.

520
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,000
Because I was just a child.

521
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:01,960
And I was afraid.

522
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,080
What about now?

523
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,520
Are you still afraid?

524
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:04,840
What are your weaknesses?

525
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,200
Hmm?

526
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,080
You're tired. You're slow.

527
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,280
You're not concentrating.

528
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,160
What are my weaknesses?

529
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,360
Underestimating me.

530
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,480
Your father
can control rock and water.

531
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,400
He can change shape into other creatures.

532
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,200
He can increase his size and speed.

533
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,720
Survive most wounds. Control weather.

534
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,920
<i>He can make potions.</i>

535
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,400
<i>He can manipulate the heat and the cold.</i>

536
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:46,400
<i>He can take the power
of any witch in the world.</i>

537
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,400
<i>It's his greatest gift
and his greatest weapon against us.</i>

538
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,640
<i>The more of us he kills,
the stronger he becomes.</i>

539
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:14,280
I'm going to the office.
Stay here and watch the family.

540
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,360
Yes, sir.

541
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,600
Hello, Soul.

542
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,560
Hello, Rowan.

543
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,280
I've never understood a man
who can grow whatever he wants

544
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:19,000
with the touch of his finger
spending so long gardening.

545
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,840
Ah, it's the old ways, brother.

546
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,480
I heard about Reutger.

547
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,680
Terrible tragedy.

548
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:33,800
It was Marcus.

549
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:37,360
Yeah, yeah, big cross of blood.

550
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,400
Heart ripped out of the chest.

551
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,440
He certainly has his methods.

552
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:46,680
He's hunting you, isn't he?

553
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:52,080
What are you gonna do?

554
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,440
I'm gonna fight.

555
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:02,440
You know,
I've always liked our family's power,

556
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:06,360
but even I can acknowledge
its relative ineffectiveness,

557
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:07,920
when it comes to a fight.

558
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,520
Especially against a man like Marcus Edge.

559
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,920
Do you remember a book our father had?

560
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,280
You found it one time
when we were playing in his study.

561
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:26,840
It had a leather cover
with a symbol on it.

562
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:30,920
I remember.

563
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,200
And I remember
he beat us both just for looking at it.

564
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,280
Yeah.

565
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:45,000
I kept it.

566
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,160
When he died.

567
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:52,360
I've still got it.

568
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,160
That old magic is dead, Soul.

569
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,760
It should stay dead.

570
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,800
I only wish I had a choice.

571
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I'm sorry.

572
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,160
I'm sorry.

573
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,320
I'm so sorry.

574
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,120
What is it?

575
00:50:58,800 --> 00:50:59,920
Nothing.

576
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:04,040
Quickest time yet. Do it again.
