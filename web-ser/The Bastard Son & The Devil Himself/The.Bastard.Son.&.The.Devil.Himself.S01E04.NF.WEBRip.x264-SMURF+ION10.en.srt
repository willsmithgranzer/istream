1
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,880
<i>We must stay really quiet.</i>

2
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,400
It's time for your story to begin...

3
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,000
Are you ready, Gabriel?

4
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,720
This is what I thought
Paris would be like.

5
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,440
Little bars. Cool music.

6
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,040
This is what I was searching for.

7
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,640
All of this.

8
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,520
All of... you.

9
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,320
There aren't boys and bars in Montana?

10
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,760
- I'm from Michigan, and...
- Oh.

11
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,680
...not like this.

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,640
Come back to my apartment tonight.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,240
And then don't leave. Stay.

14
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,440
Stay, like move in?

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,960
I don't like it when you go.

16
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,840
I don't like waking up on my own.

17
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,560
I've been on this planet for 29 years,

18
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,520
and I've known you
for four months of that.

19
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,880
So I've got some pretty solid data
to fall back on

20
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,680
when I say my life is not as good
when you're not around.

21
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,800
So, come back to mine and don't leave.

22
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,440
You just say whatever it is you want, huh?

23
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,680
I don't say what I want.
I say what I need.

24
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,480
And if you can tell me
a better way to be happy,

25
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,440
I'm all ears.

26
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,800
Okay.

27
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,400
I'll get us some more drinks.

28
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,360
Hello.

29
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,040
Fuck!

30
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,960
Jesus Christ. Now?

31
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,440
She wants you.

32
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,120
- How did you get in here?
- She gave me a key.

33
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,000
I've had a long night, okay?

34
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,560
Can you just tell her
you couldn't find me?

35
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,160
Tell her yourself.

36
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,600
I need some Night's Breath.
Do you have any?

37
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,000
Try dumping them
instead of wiping their memory for once.

38
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,360
Hello, Gabriel.

39
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,800
You haven't been checking in.

40
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,320
I've been busy.

41
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,240
I have a job for you in England.

42
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,440
What kind of job?

43
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,960
Nothing dangerous, darling.

44
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,480
Just meeting someone.

45
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,240
Meeting who?

46
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,360
Hmm.

47
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,680
What the fu...

48
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,120
Annalise?

49
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,160
Oh, God.

50
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,480
What the fuck! Are you good?

51
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,840
Yeah.

52
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,960
Okay, let's go.

53
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,120
The Fairborn Council.

54
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,320
No one said anything to me
about the Fairborn Council.

55
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,240
I'm sorry.

56
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,400
They certainly didn't say anything about
the daughter of a Fairborn Council Hunter.

57
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,800
You need to go home
before you get me killed.

58
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,040
Shit! Where's my lighter?

59
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,800
She's not going anywhere.

60
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,920
Fine. Before we go any further though,

61
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,040
for the sake of trans-fucking-parency,

62
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,440
is there anything else
I should know about you?

63
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,720
- No more secrets.
- None.

64
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,800
We're going to need supplies.

65
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,600
As much vodka as I can get for that.

66
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,360
Hmm.

67
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,040
- What is your girlfriend doing?
- Um.

68
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,280
We're not really...

69
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,120
Well, I... I mean,
I... I don't think we're...

70
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,200
Oh, please, for the love of God,
finish a sentence.

71
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,720
We're not really boyfriend and girlfriend.

72
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,280
I don't know what we are.

73
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,840
Okay, that wasn't
worth the wait.

74
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,200
And a lighter, please.

75
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,760
There you go.

76
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,320
It's a peace offering.

77
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,480
An ugly plastic lighter
for almost getting me killed.

78
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,440
- How incredibly generous.
- If you don't want it, don't have it.

79
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,840
I didn't say I didn't want it.
I said I wasn't grateful.

80
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,800
Come on.

81
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,560
This is gonna be a long journey.

82
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,280
Yeah.

83
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,360
I may have lost my temper earlier.

84
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,920
I apologize.

85
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,200
There were several items of value
within that flat that I cherish dearly,

86
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,440
and now I shall miss.

87
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,920
- It's okay. I'm sorry that...
- One gold cigarette lighter.

88
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,320
One silk chiffon scarf.

89
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,280
A selection of vintage
Russian pornographic novels.

90
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,480
An embossed ebony walking cane.

91
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,320
- One antique...
- We're sorry.

92
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,480
Really.

93
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,840
Gold.

94
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Vintage.

95
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,000
Gone.

96
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,240
To Miss Adventure.

97
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,200
That fickle bitch.

98
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,440
May she help us on our way.

99
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,160
Okay, what now?

100
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,240
We wait.

101
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,440
Are there a lot of Blood Witches
in Europe?

102
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Thousands.

103
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,720
And the fains don't know?

104
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,040
You'll find that fains are incredibly good
at not seeing what they don't want to see.

105
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,720
Didn't you have
anything brighter or slower?

106
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,360
Gabriel!

107
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,120
Welcome aboard!

108
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,760
Long time.

109
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,760
Where is my goddamn money?

110
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,080
Oh!

111
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,120
You're very untrusting, Habir.

112
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,040
It's an extremely unattractive quality.

113
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,280
So is not paying your debts.

114
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,000
Who are these two?

115
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,320
- Who are you?
- Well, I...

116
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,600
My name is Habir. This is my boat.

117
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,480
Habir's a pirate.

118
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,720
I'm Annalise. This is Nathan.

119
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,080
Hey.

120
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,560
Got anything to drink?

121
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,640
Nice.

00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,560
Take it.

127
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,160
The more relaxed you are,

128
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,720
the less likely it is
you'll accidentally turn me into soup.

129
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,040
A girl with blood in her hair

130
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,680
talks about changing her power.

131
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,160
One does make assumptions.

132
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,480
It was an accident.

133
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,840
- What did you do?
- She doesn't wanna talk about it.

134
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,520
Oh, she didn't want to talk about
who her father was.

135
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,680
She doesn't want
to talk about what her power is.

136
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,320
But you want me to risk my life for you?

137
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,680
It's Decimation.

138
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,640
The undoing.

139
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,800
Not many Fairborns have a power like that.

140
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,960
Lucky me.

141
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,920
You just have to learn how to control it.

142
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,520
I don't want to learn how to control it.

143
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,720
I want it gone.

144
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,040

that will guide us home."

155
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,920
"But I still feel afraid,"
said the little boy.

156
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,040
"That's okay," said the little girl.

What happened?

160
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,160
We got the boy back
to the council building, but he escaped.

161
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,520
- How?
<i>- </i>He had help.

162
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,480
- From who?
- The Bloods.

163
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,520
They killed a guard,
turned him inside out.

164
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,480
Then they took Annalise.

165
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,360
She's a hostage.

166
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,080
So, we're going hunting.

167
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,080
Is that France?

168
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,000
Where the wild witches roam.

169
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,520
What do I do once I get my blood?

170
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,760
I'm not a life coach, kid.

171
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,800
I'm just here to get you from A to B.

172
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,480
Look, let's just concentrate
on keeping you alive.

173
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,080
Worry about the future when it gets here.

174
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,200
If it gets here.

175
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,320
That's the spirit.

176
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,440
Safe travels!

177
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,880
Albie.

178
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,360
Hi, Gabriel.

179
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,040
One adult, two children.

180
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,120
Okay, this will cover the three of you.

181
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,800
What's with the necklace?

182
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,840
Here, if you enter
another witch's territory,

183
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,560
you must acknowledge your presence
and pay your way.

184
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,800
Or else they might, uh,
you know, try and kill you.

185
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,880
Et voilà.

186
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,400
It's just fishing shit.

187
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,320
Okay, it's magic shit.

188
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,840
Welcome to Paris.

189
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,480
Come on.

190
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,200
My apartment is just round here.

191
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,520
What, is that where the Cut is?

192
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,680
No, that's where a change of clothes is.

193
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,160
Please remember we're on a tight schedule.

194
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,360
How could I forget?
You bring it up every five minutes.

195
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,240
This way.

196
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,160
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Fuck!

197
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,120
Aww, shit! Been robbed!

198
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,440
Oh, no, it's gone. It's fucking gone!

199
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,680
What's gone?

200
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,920
Something
that's very fucking precious.

201
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,400
- You're having a bad few days, huh?
- You think?

202
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,160
Look, I'm really sorry
about all this, but we need to go.

203
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,040
The Council could track us here.

204
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,280
Or your father could track us here,
you mean.

205
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,960
No, we can't go until I've got my stuff.

206
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,640
- We don't have time to help you.
- You're not listening to me.

207
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,840
I can't make the next Cut
without my equipment.

208
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,480
My equipment is gone.
You see where I'm going with this?

209
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,240
No equipment, no Mercury, no blood.

210
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,360
- How are we supposed to get it back?
- The door isn't damaged.

211
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,960
So, you know,
whoever got in had a key, maybe.

220
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,560
Where's Ruby?

221
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,760
I don't know.
I haven't seen her for months.

222
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,200
She robbed me.

223
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,920
She took my equipment.

224
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,560
No, it's not possible.
Ruby would never do that.

225
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,760
She was a goddamn drug addict, okay?

226
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,200
She used to rob you.
I used to dare her to.

227
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,040
It was a very funny game we played.

228
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,520
Well, look who's back.

229
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,920
Nicky.

230
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,440
Hmm. Sit down and have a drink.

231
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,720
Who are your friends?

232
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,560
They're cargo
for Mercury, from the UK.

233
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,600
They're Blood Witches.

234
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,480
I didn't think
there were any Bloods left in the UK.

235
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,560
Two less now.

236
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,440
- Hugo!
- Hmm?

237
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:10,000
Pour some coffee.
We've got a victim of crime here.

238
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,440
Gabriel, I was beginning to think
I wouldn't see you again. What happened?

239
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,520
Ruby robbed me.

240
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,040
I always said I didn't trust her.

241
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,600
You literally never said that.

242
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,840
He's a terrible judge of character.

243
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,520
This will warm you up.

244
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,640
Oh, no. I'm okay.

245
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,480
To the friends at our table!

246
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,320
And our enemies in the dark.

247
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,440
And the ones we love who hunt them.

248
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,280
It's been crazy since you left.

249
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,776
What's going on?

250
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,160
Word came over
of some troubles from the UK.

251
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,520
- The Fairborns killed a load of Bloods.
- The Bloods killed a load of Fairborns.

252
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,040
Which is good. Obviously.

253
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,160
Well, whoever started it,
it was a spark.

254
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,440
Now, we hear the Fairborn Council
puts their embassies on high alert.

255
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,560
All over Europe.

256
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,800
Why?

257
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,080
They're looking for someone.

258
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,200
Aren't you worried that the fains
are gonna find out? Or the police?

259
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,720
Fains we can deal with, but the gendarmes.

260
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,000
One in ten is a Fairborn anyway.

261
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,920
Why stay if it's so dangerous?

262
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,320
You think we should leave our home
because the Fairborns made it dangerous?

263
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,640
That's what led them
to drive us here in the first place.

264
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,680
I'm done running.

265
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,440
You might be a refugee.

266
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,880
I don't want to be.

267
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,080
That's all very noble,
but it doesn't help me get my shit back.

268
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,000
Agh, if Ruby has stolen gear,

269
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,560
there's only one place
she's gonna take it.

270
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,240
- Oh, no, please God.
- Aha!

271
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,656
Don't make me go.

272
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,840
I can't bear the smell.

273
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,800
The smell of what?

274
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,600
SPECIAL SHOP
MAGIC OBJECTS - BOUGHT AND SOLD

275
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,000
Ah, Gabriel.
I thought you were in London.

276
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,600
Yeah, I'm back.
Has Ruby been here?

277
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,200
Ruby? No.

278
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,360
Monsieur and madam,
would you care to browse?

279
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,200
I sell everything
a pair of young witches could need.

280
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,200
Huh? Et voilà.

281
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,520
A love potion.

282
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,960
Not that either of you would need it. No.

283
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,760
How about this?

284
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,160
- A lot of magic in a lost instrument.
- Oh!

285
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,480
Hey. Ruby.

286
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,360
- I have no idea. How about this?
- Please give me...

287
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,560
Bathe with this once a week.

288
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,120
And your enemies
will suffer great misfortune.

289
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,160
Okay, okay.

290
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,760
She came to me about a month or so ago
with a box of stuff to sell.

291
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,120
She didn't say it was stolen.

292
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,600
- Where is it?
- One of my regulars bought it.

293
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,600
Who?

294
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,120
You really need it, huh?

295
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,640
Everything has a price. You know this.

296
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,280
I can give you
the daughter of a Fairborn Hunter.

297
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,360
The girl?

298
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,280
What am I gonna do
with a Fairborn Hunter's daughter?

299
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,640
- Sell her back to them.
- What, I'm a kidnapper now?

300
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,120
No one gets hurt.
She goes home, you get rich.

301
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,600
And I get what I want.

302
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,480
Wait here. Give me an hour.

303
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,960
I'll bring your stuff. No funny business.

304
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,640
No funny business?

305
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,080
- What's going on?
- We reached an arrangement.

306
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,840
What do we do now then?

307
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,480
Wait patiently.

308
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,200
I got you something.

309
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,960
You mean you stole me something.

310
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,200
Yeah.

311
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,800
Thank you.

312
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,880
Never did get you
a birthday present.

313
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,560
We'll get to Mercury,
then go anywhere you want.

314
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,240
Just the two of us.

315
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,640
Hey! Hey-o!

316
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,800
Do I need to throw
a bucket of water at you?

317
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,536
Now is not the time or place.

318
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,640
What, Paris?

319
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,000
Okay, it is the place,
but it's not the time.

320
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,520
Gabriel.

321
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,440
Where is it?

322
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,416
There's a book.
There's a little book that should be here.

323
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,080
She never gave me a book.

324
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,000
- You sure?
- Yes.

325
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,040
We good?

326
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,496
Deal's off.
This isn't what I need.

327
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,560
You can't.
You promised me the girl.

328
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,800
What?

329
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,080
- Forget the girl, okay?
- Too late. I already cashed in.

330
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,800
- Run.
- What?

331
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,160
- Your friend sold you out.
- Run!

332
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,560
They went that way.

333
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,040
Do you like that story, Gabriel?

334
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,800
Will you look after it for me?

335
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,480
In a minute, we're going to go outside.

336
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,880
I want you to stay very quiet
and very close to me.

337
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,040
But if I tell you to run,
then you do not stop.

338
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,440
Even if you see something awful.

339
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,480
Even if you see us in trouble.

340
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,680
Even if we call to you
and beg you to come back for us.

341
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,680
Do you understand, Gabriel?

342
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,280
You run and don't stop.

343
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,320
Yes.

344
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,280
Remember that you are very brave.

345
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,040
And that I love you very much.

346
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,040
We tested
that stuff you had on you.

347
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,600
Cocaine.

348
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,360
Amphetamines. Heroin.

349
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,640
You're in a lot of trouble.

350
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,680
Blood Witch.

351
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,560
So, I wasn't carrying any of that shit.

352
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,480
Maybe some amphetamines,
but I don't think so.

353
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,560
Hmm.

354
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,120
You're on our turf now, Gabriel.

355
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,440
Mercury can't help you here.

356
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,720
But you can help yourself.

357
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,840
We're looking
for your traveling companion.

358
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,640
The daughter of a Fairborn Hunter?

359
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,720
Come on, I was bullshitting.

360
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,440
You think I'd really travel with...

361
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,600
If you tell me where he is,

362
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:12,640
it could make what comes next
less painful for you.

363
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,040
Huh?

364
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,280
Not the choice
I would have made.

365
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,080
Hey, look, it's the cargo.

366
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,760
Shouldn't you two be long gone?

367
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,520
What's he done this time?

368
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,840
Where's Nathan?

369
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,640
Where's Annalise?

370
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,200
I don't know.

371
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:17,240
Just our luck
to find the one loyal pirate.

372
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,840
I'm not loyal to anyone.

373
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,080
I just don't like you.

374
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,120
Thank you.

375
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,960
What do you know about Europe, Jessica?

376
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,640
It's dangerous.

377
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,080
Uh, yes, it's extremely dangerous.

378
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,240
And we're gonna be going
into the very heart of it.

379
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,880
We're gonna have to fight for survival.

380
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,600
We're gonna have to be ruthless.

381
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,840
We won't all make it back.

382
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,960
But I think you will.

383
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:06,240
Because I think
you can be ruthless, Jessica,

384
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,680
just like the best of us.

385
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,760
Oh, fuck!

386
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,440
Find out where they are.

387
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,000
Don't let us down.

388
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,760
You don't have to do this.
You're just a child.

389
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,440
People always want to tell me what I am.

390
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,000
But the truth is...

391
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,240
I can be anything I want to be.

392
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,600
Interesting.

393
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,840
Jessica.

394
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,160
I remember when we found that girl.

395
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,720
Two years old and scared to death.

396
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,520
Well, she's not scared now.

397
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,400
No, she's not.

398
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,160
Paris.

399
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,920
Good girl.

400
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,440
It's time to go.

401
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,800
Where?

402
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,360
Nowhere very nice, I'm afraid.

403
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Hi.

404
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,240
Hey.

405
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,520
We need him here.

406
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,320
We're taking him across town.

407
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,880
Not now you're not.
His lawyer's here.

408
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,960
Lawyer?

409
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,680
Ah, there he is.

410
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,920
What are the charges against him?

411
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,200
Assaulting a police officer.
Drug possession. Mm-hmm.

412
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,520
And what are the real charges?

413
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,920
You think we don't know what you're doing?

414
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,520
You think you're going to
take another one of us

415
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,760
to disappear in your cells? No.

416
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,400
Mnh-mnh.

417
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,200
Not today.

418
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,600
Do you have any idea
what you're getting involved in?

419
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,440
Who he's protecting?

420
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:27,600
None of you are going to leave here.

421
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,120
What's going on?

422
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,840
He's using his power!

423
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,640
Ah, hello, Gabriel.

424
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,256
I had this all under control, you know.

425
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,520
Of course you did.

426
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,240
Hey, Hugo, the keys.

427
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,080
I can't believe
I'm breaking witches out

428
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,360
for the second day in a row.

429
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,920
You wanna be careful.
You're gonna get yourself a reputation.

430
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,200
Oh, yeah,
what's that like, having a reputation?

431
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,880
Has its moments.

432
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,960
Shit.

433
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,800
- Go, go, go!
- Get in. Get in!

434
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,120
I passed my test,
like, a month ago,

435
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,720
and I'm already getting in car chases.

436
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:44,440
- Are they following us?
- Can't see anyone.

437
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,600
Take the next left.

438
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,560
- Thank you.
- We only did it because we needed you.

439
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,760
Can you take us to Mercury? Now.

440
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,000
I still need my stuff.

441
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,040
Oh, my God! It's gone.

442
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,440
No, it's not.

443
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,280
I was just looking
in the wrong place for it.

444
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,360
I'll be five minutes.

445
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,800
Fuck it. We're here.
We might as well get a drink.

446
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,920
Thank you.

447
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:14,080
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!
We're gonna keep that. Thank you.

448
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:18,600
- To the friends at our table.
- And our enemies in the dark.

449
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,920
To those that hunt them.

450
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,160
Ahem.

451
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,640
Uh, how long does it take him to make
the Cut once he's got his equipment?

452
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,920
Gabriel doesn't make the Cuts.
They were made long ago.

453
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,840
What?

454
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:34,160
The doorway to Mercury is
at the bar we met you at earlier.

455
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,080
We could have gone through this morning
instead of running all over Paris?

456
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:47,240
Yeah. Why?
What did Gabriel tell you?

457
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,640
You stole from me.

458
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,520
You left me in a bar.

459
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,240
You ran away, and you left me.

460
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,520
And then you just... with no word.

461
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,720
Give it back.

462
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,720
'Cause I asked you to move in with me.

463
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,600
Just say no.

464
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:15,480
Just say, "No, Clark.
I don't want that. I'm not ready."

465
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,320
How hard is that?

466
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,880
How hard is it to not ask the question?

467
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,240
You knew that wasn't my scene.

468
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,600
You knew that, but you asked it anyway
because that's what you wanted.

469
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,400
Oh, sorry, "needed."

470
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,200
You needed to cross my boundaries.
Well, fuck you. And give it back.

471
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,800
I wish you worried about losing me
like you worry about losing that book.

472
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,960
Why did you take it?

473
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,000
It was the only thing that
would make you come looking for me.

474
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,520
Added my name.

475
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,160
I don't know why I bothered.

476
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,400
One day, Gabriel,

477
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,960
you're gonna find the guts
to see something through to the end.

478
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,880
Wha... What are you doing?

479
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,440
Hi.

480
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,560
Sorry, can I help you?

481
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,120
No, I just got lost
looking for the bathroom.

482
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,120
They're down the hall.

483
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,520
Thank you.

484
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,720
Uh, no problem.

485
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,120
Hmm.

486
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,680
<i>- Blue Steel.</i> Didn't you think?
- I thought it was good.

487
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,600
Get what you needed?

488
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,280
Yeah, we can go.

489
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,720
What was it then, that was so valuable?

490
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,560
Oh, my God.

491
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,640
A children's book.

492
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,320
It's a first edition.

493
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,120
- Fuck you.
- You lied to us about the Cut.

494
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,400
I bent the truth.

495
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:29,240
- What's so important about the book?
- Someone important gave it to me.

496
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,320
Who?

497
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:37,240
I don't know. Can't remember.

498
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,600
We could have been safe
with Mercury hours ago.

499
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,040
But instead,
we've wasted a whole day here.

500
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:46,200
We're running from the Fairborn Council,
from the Hunters,

501
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,440
from a murderous heart-eating psychopath.

502
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What murderous heart-eating psychopath?

503
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:01,280
You're the son of Marcus Edge.

504
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,040
Excuse me, you're fucking what?

505
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,880
I'm the son of Marcus Edge.

506
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,480
Oh, Jesus Christ.

507
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,200
And the Fairborns are after you because...

508
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,960
"His own blood will kill the wolf."

509
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,080
A prophecy.

510
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,280
I'm supposed to kill my father.

511
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,360
Well, that is just fucking great.

512
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,960
That is just...

513
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,680
What happened to no more secrets?

514
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,320
Hmm?

515
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,640
Marcus Edge?
I should never have taken this job.

516
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,800
- It's fine by us if you want to leave.
- Oh, I ought to.

517
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,800
If you want,
we can take them through to Mercury.

518
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,840
We're going back to the bar anyway.

519
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,320
Sounds good to me.

520
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,200
Take them if you want to risk it. I'm out.

521
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,800
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a life to get back to.

522
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,680
I wish you all the best.

523
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,520
Au revoir!

524
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,680
Don't worry about him.

525
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,920
Let's get you two
where you need to go, hmm?

526
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,240
Mwah!

527
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,400
Let's go.

528
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,400

How about a drink? Jacques, cognac.

Hugo guessed who you were.

00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,080
Me? I didn't believe it.

539
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,360
The son of Marcus Edge.

540
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,400
Half Blood, half Fairborn.

541
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,440
Your father fights for us.

542
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,040
He unites us.

543
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,600
And one day, he will lead us.

544
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,200
"His own blood will kill the wolf."

545
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,560
Uh, I'm not looking to kill my father.

546
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,280
Well, what you're looking
to do doesn't come into it.

547
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,640
It's what you're destined for
that matters.

548
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,440
And what you're destined for
cannot come to pass.

555
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,600
They already went through the Cut.

556
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,080
Guess I was too late.

557
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,080
It's the Cut!

558
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,360

It's Gabriel.

563
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,720

568
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,440
Hey.

569
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,560
Are you okay? Yeah?

570
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,520
Come on. We have to get to the Cut.

571
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,960
- I'm sorry.

00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,280
Oh, my God.

578
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,920
Ah, it's quite clear
you cannot manage without me.

579
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,120
I leave you for five minutes.
Look what happens.

580
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,720
Now I can never go back to that bar.
Which I loved.

581
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,800
Best jukebox in Paris.

582
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,560
And now we'll have to take
the long way to Mercury's.

583
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,320
You're coming with us now?

584
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,280
Well, the thing is,

585
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,960
I actually don't
get paid unless I deliver you myself.

586
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,960
We have five days.
Can you get us there in time?

587
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:24,640
It's a long
and treacherous route, full of peril.

588
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,800
Almost certainly ending up
with at least one of us dead.

589
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:33,840
So, we're going to need
a very big bottle of vodka

590
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,000
and some comfortable socks.

591
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,160
- We should probably leave straightaway.
- Yeah, no shit.

592
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,760
You shouldn't have lied to us.

593
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,280
And you should have told me
who you really were.

594
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,560
Why did you come back?

595
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:54,200
I thought I should see it through
to the end.

596
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,320
A decision I'm already regretting.

597
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:01,240
Okay, let's go.

598
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
You coming?

599
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,320
Yeah.

600
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,080
Yeah.
