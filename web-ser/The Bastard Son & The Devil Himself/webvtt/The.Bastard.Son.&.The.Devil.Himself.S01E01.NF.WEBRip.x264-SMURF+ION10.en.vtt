WEBVTT

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.400
It should be around here somewhere.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.440
So, do you think it's true?

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.920
What they say about him?
That he's the wolf's child?

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.040
Fine, be like that.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.560
There.

This your property?

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.880
No.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.160
- Can I ask you what you're doing here?
- No.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.280
We've had reports of suspicious activity
on the premises, so...

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.520
- What do you think?
- Excuse me.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.360
If you can't tell me what you're doing,
I'll have to arrest you.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.200
Excuse me. I'm talking to you.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.000
I just need you both
to step away from the house.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.920
Aww, shit.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.960
Had enough of this.
You're under arrest.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.680
- Just hold that thought.
- You don't have to say anything.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.080
But it may harm your defense...

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.040
Fuck off.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.680
Her kids are in here.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.600
You shouldn't touch it.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:01.960
Why not?

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.680
Because yeah, I do think it's true.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.240
Gran.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.000
<i>The boy can stay here
along with his sister,</i>

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.080
<i>but only as a ward of the council.</i>

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.160
<i>We'll have legal rights over him.</i>

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.280
<i>Under what laws exactly?</i>

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.440
Under the only laws that matter.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.480
The laws of
the Council of Fairborn Witches.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.800
If or when he proves to be a threat
to the Fairborn Witch community,

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.520
then we'll move him.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.160
You're scared of him already.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.040
The war's over, you know.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.560
Thanks for the tea.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.880
What are you going to call him?

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.920
His mother was going to name him Nathan.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.560
Nathan.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.880
<i>There have always been witches
in the world.</i>

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.440
<i>Blood Witches and Fairborn Witches.</i>

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.360
- There's us and the fains.
- What are fains?

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.000
Fains are the ones
with no magic in them...

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.080
...and no interest in it either.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.120
Almost everyone in the world is a fain.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.920
That means that almost everyone you meet,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.640
you'll have to keep a secret from.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.720
Why?

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.480
People are scared of us.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:25.880
Are witches bad?

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:26.960
No.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.880
Though some of them
are so full of darkness

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.640
that when you look into their eyes,

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.440
you think
you'll never see the light again.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.520
Hmm.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.960
- But we're good?
- Yes.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.200
- And we're Fairborn Witches?
- Yes.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.800
Am I a Fairborn Witch, Gran?

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.880
No.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.000
Am I a Blood Witch?

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.080
You're my grandson.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.720
You're Nathan Byrne.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.960
And for now, that'll do just fine.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.016
Do you know one
of the ways you can tell a Blood Witch

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.200
from us Fairborn Witches?

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.480
How much quicker they heal.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.880
- How are you sleeping at night?
- Okay.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.960
Do you find yourself
getting quick to anger?

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.160
No.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.120
If you listen carefully,
can you hear my heartbeat?

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.320
No.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.840
Do you ever have negative feelings
about other witches?

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:31.920
No.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.520
Nathan.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.560
- Sometimes.
- Who?

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.480
My sister.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.480
Because she's a Fairborn Witch?

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.000
- No.
- Why then?

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.520
She stinks.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.880
Thirty-five seconds.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.640
That's good. That's about the same as me.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.400
Do you want to know why
everyone hates us so much?

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.000
Why our people won't talk to us?

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.680
It's because of what your dad did.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.080
He killed witches.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.280
A lot of them.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.080
He locked them in a room,
and he turned into a wild animal

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.760
and ran from each of them.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.200
Men and women.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.760
Little children and babies.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.640
And he tore out their throats.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.800
But that's not even the worst part.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.080
The worst part is what he did next.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.000
Because your dad can take
other witches' powers.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.400
Do you know how?

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.720
He rips their heart out of their body
and eats it,

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.200
while it's still warm.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.480
He's a monster.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.640
The most evil Blood Witch that ever lived.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.920
He put a baby in my mom,
so she killed herself when you were born.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.920
Why do you think they ask
if you can hear heartbeats?

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.360
It's because they're very scared.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.640
Scared you're going to
turn into a monster.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.720
Just like him.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.960
Do you ever have violent dreams?

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:20.880
No.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.040
Do you find yourself
getting quick to anger?

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.360
No.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.200
Do you have fantasies
about hurting people?

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.360
- Only their feelings.
- How are you sleeping?

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.200
Butt naked with a window open.
How about you?

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.680
Do you ever have violent dreams?

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.480
Dreamt I was singing
in the school assembly,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.880
but my microphone wouldn't turn on,
and everyone was booing me.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:42.920
What do you think that means?

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.880
Do you find yourself
getting quick to anger?

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.480
I don't think it's a sex thing.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.640
The microphone not working,

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:52.840
'cause I can tell you're thinking that,
but I don't think that's what it is.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.240
- Nathan.
- I think...

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.960
No, I don't find myself
getting quick to anger.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:02.320
Do you find yourself having negative
feelings about other witches?

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.720
Very, very occasionally, I'll have
a small negative feeling about you,

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.760
but I don't want you
to take it personally.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.800
If you listen carefully,
can you hear my heartbeat?

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.320
No.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.960
But are we 100% sure you've got one?

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.600
Forty seconds, give or take.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.840
You should take this more seriously.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.080
You take it seriously enough
for both of us.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.680
I'll see you next month.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.120
Counting the days already.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.760
Class,
we have a new pupil starting today.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.520
Annalise, would you stand up
and tell everyone a bit about yourself?

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.560
Got a pen?

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.040
Uh, hi, I'm Annalise.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.880
My dad's work meant that my brother
and I had to change schools from London.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.280
But it seems nice.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.040
Yeah, I think that's it really. Hi.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.720
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:22.160
We're all looking forward
to having you in the class. Right.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:25.720
Today, we're going to be
looking at differential equations.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.080
Jessica, didn't think you were invited.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.760
Everyone in sixth form is crashing
your dweeby friend's party.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.136
- His house is gonna get trashed.
- Okay.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.280
Well, you were supposed to come
in costume though. Bit embarrassing.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:24.600

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.080
Do you know them?

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.280
No.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.320
Guys, could we just be aware
of fluids, please?

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.280
You know what? Next time,
maybe someone else should host the party.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.200
Jack!

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.520
What?
Are we living under a fascist regime?

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.000
My dad's a tyrant.
You wouldn't understand.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.960
Why don't we go to yours for a change?

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.720
I live in a caravan, mate.
We can fit about five people in there.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.240
Well, we wouldn't know
'cause you've never invited us around.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.320
- And I never will.
- Why not?

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.160
- I got secrets and shit, innit!
- Like what?

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.040
My gran's a witch.

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:26.960
- Shut up!
- It's true.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.600
My whole family. We're all witches.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.056
- You're not a witch. You're drunk.
- You can be both.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.440
Oh, go on. Do us a spell then.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.120
It's not just spells.

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:38.480
You get one power when you turn 17.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.760
And only after, you get three gifts,

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.360
and you drink your family's blood.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.600
You're fucking weird, man.
I'm worried about you.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.800
No, not on my parents' bed!

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:58.840
- Shouldn't tell people that.
- What?

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:01.680
That you're a witch.

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.200
Nah, I was just messing about.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.120
No, you weren't.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.680
Yeah, I was.

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.760
I'm a Fairborn.

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.040
You weren't messing about.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.440
- You're...
- Yeah.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.240
- Nah.
- Yeah.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.440
Fuck.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.160
You're Nathan Byrne.
I'm not supposed to talk to you.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.800
- Who says?
- My dad.

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.560
- Who's your dad?
- He's in the Council.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.240
Yeah, what does he do?

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.000
He's chief executive
of the Fairborn Council Protection Unit.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.600
- He's a Hunter?
- He's chief executive of the Hunters.

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.000
His work made him move down here?

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.800
Hey, I think that might have something
to do with you.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.800
So, what's it been like...

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.600
...being the only witch family
in a town full of fains?

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.080
Just gotta keep your head down.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.400
How's that going?

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.600
Not very well.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.560
Why are you not supposed to talk to me?

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.280
You know why.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.240
Evil dad.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.520
Evil dad.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:02.640
You seem all right.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:05.680
Considering.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.920
So, I'll see you around, yeah?

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.240
Maybe.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.960
We can talk about how we're both witches.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.840
There's no such thing as witches.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.040
Wait.

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:48.880
Annalise!

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.560
You looking for Annalise?

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.760
- Yeah, do you know her?
- Uh, yeah, I think we know her.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.280
Oh, shit!

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.880
Yeah, that's his sister.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.320
And it's my cousin.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.720
And we don't want you talking to her.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.920
Whoa! Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, Nathan.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.680
Not getting quick to anger, are you?

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:11.200
Not having negative feelings?

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:13.200
Hey, come on, bruv. What? What?

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.800
Oh, come on. Don't you wanna fight back?

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.800
Not even if I, uh...

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.080
Nothing?

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.040
Pussy!

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:54.560
You have a good night?

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:55.640
Yeah.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.440
My brother's a dickhead.

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:42.080
It's fine.

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:44.760
It's not fine.

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:49.840
What if there's
a family dominant dickhead gene?

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:52.960
Like, what if I have dickhead kids?

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:55.280
Or dickhead grandkids?

00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:58.960
He was right though.

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.760
- It's probably better if we don't...
- Want a crisp?

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:09.720
My family don't decide
who I'm friends with.

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:11.720
What about yours?

00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:18.760
My family don't care who I'm friends with.

00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:21.920
Well, there you go then. It's decided.

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:24.240
We can hang out.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.120
Just like that?

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.200
Yeah.

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:29.880
How do you know I even like you?

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.160
'Cause I'm fucking great, mate.

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:38.760
And I'm the only witch in this school
who doesn't hate you.

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.800
There's no such thing as witches.

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:42.880
Yeah.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.400
<i>How are you sleeping at night?</i>

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:50.800
<i>You having
negative feelings towards other witches?</i>

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.400
<i>Do you have fantasies about hurting...</i>

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.440
<i>If you listen carefully,
can you hear my heartbeat?</i>

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.440
<i>Do you find yourself
getting quick to anger?</i>

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:58.056
<i>Do you have violent dreams?</i>

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.560
<i>Do you ever have fantasies
about hurting people?</i>

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:03.960
<i>If you listen carefully,
can you hear my heartbeat?</i>

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.480
Do you wanna hang out on Friday?
I can sneak away.

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.720
- I can't. Jessica's turning 17.
- Hmm.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.000
Giving ceremony.

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:12.120
Shit. I wonder what her power will be.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.000
Is being a massive bitch a power?

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:16.000
Kinda.

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.720
Yeah. See you at lunch.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.240
Nathan.

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.680
Niall, Kieran.

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:33.320
Remember telling you
to stay away from my sister.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:36.480
Hmm.

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:40.440
Are we ever gonna do something
about this thing between us?

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:43.560
I mean, the tension's killing me.

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.240
Plus, I think
your cousin's starting to get jealous.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.960
Fuck you.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.120
Okay. See you later then.

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.040
Fucking dickhead.

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:23.680
There.

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:34.480
Jessica, on the day of your 17th birthday,

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.080
I give you your first gift.

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.080
Thanks.

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.080
Your second gift.

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.960
She really loved you, you know.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:11.640
Your third gift.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:16.960
Thanks, Gran.

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:19.160
Now...

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:32.000
Your family's blood runs through you.

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:35.120
Take of it and become whole.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.560
Tilt your head back, girl.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.280
It came.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.000
"You have been accepted

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:11.280
into the Fairborn Council
Cadet training program."

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:15.200
You gonna be a Hunter?

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:18.120
Protecting the Fairborn community
from the Blood Witch scourge.

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.520
I didn't know you'd applied.

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.560
Just been waiting
till I was old enough.

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.200
You know,
I think I feel different already.

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.120
Stronger.

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:31.120
I was reading about
what happens to a Blood Witch

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.800
if they don't get their blood
when they turn 17.

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:37.080
Apparently, it's agony.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.320
Apparently, they have convulsions,

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.720
and they start bleeding out
of their eyes and their ears,

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.320
and they can't stop screaming.

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.400
And then they die.

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:53.416
I'll take blood pouring out my eyes
if I don't have to look at you anymore.

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.040
Will you two stop it?

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:58.280
There are no Blood Witches here, Jessica.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.040
Well, he's not a Fairborn.

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:03.560
He's gotta be something, doesn't he?

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:22.720
Yeah.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.080
Who is it?

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:33.360
Nathan.

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:36.120
Mom.

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.680
I've come back, Nathan.

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.960
I wanted to tell you something.

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:49.400
I wanted to tell you...

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.320
that you killed me.

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.360
It's your fault I'm dead.

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.840
All your fault.

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.000
How dare you!

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.120
Your mother would be ashamed.

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.240
Ashamed enough
to kill herself and her two kids?

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:15.800
Apologize.

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:17.680
No.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.480
So it looks like I found my power.

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:43.800
Oi, Blood Witch.

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:48.720
What you doing out here, freak?

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.000
Oi.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.760
I'm talking to you.

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:01.280
You think ignoring this
is gonna make it stop?

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:02.440
'Cause it's not.

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:06.040
You're a traitor, just like your mom.

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:08.360
Okay.

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.280
You. With me.

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.160
Soul O'Brien's son.

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:28.360
Of all the people to pick a fight with.

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:29.760
He picked it with me.

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:32.080
Yeah, well,
you certainly rose to the challenge.

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:35.800
Where are we going?

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:38.080
- Fairborn Council Building.
- Why?

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.920
Some people wanna talk with you.

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:42.840
- Why?
- Why do you think?

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:52.240
Jessica started her training.

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.240
She could make a great Hunter.

00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:59.440
Massive hunt is definitely
what I think when I see her.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.560
Your sister really hates you, doesn't she?

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:08.880
Yeah.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:11.480
Perhaps she blames you
for your mother's death.

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:15.440
Yeah, no, I got that. Thanks.

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:11.480
Always thought this place
would be more impressive.

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.320
Just saying.

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:21.680
Okay.

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.360
What's this?

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.040
It's a re-creation.

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.800
This is the home
of Rita and Frank Applewood,

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:34.360
twelve months ago almost to the day.

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:41.080
I'm Reutger Sillwood.

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:44.320
Head of the Council of Fairborn Witches.

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:46.800
And I'm sorry
we've never met before, Nathan.

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:50.560
Though I assure you, I've been keeping
a very close eye on your development.

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:55.760
Soul O'Brien, Executive Administrator
of the Fairborn Council Protection Unit.

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:58.040
You attacked my son today.

00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:59.640
He started it.

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:00.960
Did he hit you first?

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:02.440
No.

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.880
- Then you started it.
- He was being very fucking annoying.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.920
Have you read up on
your witching history, Nathan?

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:11.520
I know Harry shags Hermione at the end.

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.240
Do you know
what the Blood Witches did to us?

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:18.360
Do you have any idea
what they're capable of?

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:21.360
What men like your father are capable of?

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:23.360
Ron.

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:26.280
She ends up shagging Ron.

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:28.880
That was gonna annoy me.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.240
Okay, well, this was fun.

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:32.320
Thanks.

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:35.840
We need to stop
getting the disposable coffee pods.

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:39.200
- It's criminal how many we go through.
- That's you, that is.

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:41.080
I have one cup a day.

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.040
Not sure that's true, but okay.

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:45.360
Will you remind me
I need to ring Beth for a catch-up?

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:46.800
We cannot wait for her to call us.

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.680
Oh, well, like you called
your mom every weekend when at uni?

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:53.120
No, I know. I know.
She's probably working too hard.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.961
- Going to the pub too hard.
- Well, I should hope not.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.080
As long as she's enjoying
herself. That's the important thing.

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:02.320
- And studying, don't you think...
- Why can't we see them?

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:05.840
The spell can only trace
the history of the objects it's cast on.

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:08.280
They never found the bodies.

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:10.960
I mean, Gemma's sweet,
though I can see Aisha being...

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:13.480
What was that?

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:16.720
I don't know. Stay here.

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:18.520
- Frank.
- Wait there.

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:21.080
Be careful!

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.640
Can you see anything? Frank?

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:38.280
No! No, please, no!

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:39.960
Please no!

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:42.680
- Rita! Rita!
- Frank!

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:45.080
- Oh, God!
- Please!

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.440
- No! No, wait!
- Frank!

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:48.800
Wait!

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:50.680
No!

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.880
Please! Please!

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:28.880
So, who were the Applewoods then?

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:31.560
Frank Applewood was a member of the Ten.

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:35.200
The ten sitting Fairborn Council members

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:38.520
who had sworn
to find and punish your father,

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:42.120
Marcus Edge,
for the Wolfhagen Peace Massacre.

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.680
Nine of them are now dead.

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:46.440
Who's the last one left?

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:47.520
I am.

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:51.640
Do you know what happened? At Wolfhagen?

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:53.720
He killed everyone.

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:56.800
He tore them apart. Limb from limb.

00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.800
He stole their powers and ran away.

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:01.960
No one saw him again.

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:06.040
Until ten years later,
when rumors started to spread

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:08.600
that a Fairborn woman
was pregnant with his child.

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.880
Rumors that turned out to be true,
of course.

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:16.360
Before the end of the year,
you'll turn 17, and you'll get your power.

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:20.800
You could just be
another normal Fairborn Witch.

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:24.280
Or you could inherit something far darker,

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:26.680
<i>far more dangerous.</i>

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:30.360
What do you think I'm going to do?
Turn 17 and start murdering people?

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:34.920
You're already displaying signs
of anger and violence.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.840
Nathan, right now
your power lies inside you dormant.

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:41.040
It will wake.

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:44.720
And it will change you.

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:47.560
It does for every witch.

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:51.680
<i>Good... or bad.</i>

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:00.160
<i>Is it true you attacked Niall?</i>

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:02.120
Not really.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.040
Sort of. I don't know.

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:06.880
Okay, wow.
Three vague answers to one question.

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:09.760
Can I assume
there's some truth to the tale,

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:12.680
or did he smash his own bike
over his head?

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.840
No, that was me.

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:16.520
- That was dumb.
- Yeah.

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:18.600
Should have cut the brakes off
and given it back.

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:21.520
See? You look nice,
but you're actually evil.

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:23.080
You think I look nice?

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:25.280
Shut up.

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:28.240
- You think I look nice.
- Get away from me.

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:45.080
How'd you do that?

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:49.280
Trick is to tell yourself it doesn't hurt.

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:53.480
- That's the trick, huh?
- Yeah.

00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:59.800
What do you think
your power's gonna be?

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:05.640
Super strength.

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:09.320
Invisibility.

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:15.200
Turn into the Hulk when I get angry.

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:17.880
I don't know.

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:24.560
My dad's core power is botanical,
which could be quite nice.

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:27.320
Grow plants everywhere.

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:32.080
Mom's element's water,

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:35.960
but... I've never really seen her
do anything with it.

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:41.680
What was your mom's power?

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:48.200
She made potions.

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.920
Are you okay?

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:43.760
Yeah.

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.200
Yeah, um...

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:51.080
Yeah.

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:15.720
Good afternoon, Nathan.

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:23.200
Did you forget what day it was?

00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:31.520
- How are you sleeping at night?
- Okay.

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:33.440
- Have violent dreams?
- No.

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:36.000
- You find yourself quick to anger?
- No.

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:39.800
Do you find yourself having any neg...

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:43.680
Uh...

00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:50.880
Do you find yourself having negative
feelings about... about other witches?

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:53.200
No.

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.800
You quick to anger?

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:56.400
No.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.920
Do you have fantasies
about hurting people?

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000
No.

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:04.600
If you listen carefully,
can you hear my heartbeat?

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:16.440
No.

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:26.720
I'll see you next month.

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:51.560
Come on.

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:04.320
- Come on.
- Annalise.

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:05.560
Come on!

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:10.200
Fuck's sake.

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:14.440
Hurry up!

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:16.040
Where we going?

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:17.840
Come on, slowcoach!

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:24.640
Slow down!

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.840
I'm gonna prove what you are.

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:14.120
Yeah. Who am I?

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:16.520
Your father's son.

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:21.760
You okay with this?

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:28.280
Do it.

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:46.480
- I knew it.
- Doesn't mean anything.

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:50.680
You know exactly what it means.
Do it again.

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:53.840
Do it again.

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:06.680
Fuck.

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:09.520
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:11.640
Uh, what... what do we do?

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:14.520
Go home.

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:23.000
Jessica.

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:26.640
See, I always knew what you really were.

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:32.320
Please, help me. Please.

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:35.560
Wouldn't you rather die
than be a Blood Witch?

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:37.840
I know I would.

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:40.920
Even you can't heal that.

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:45.080
Please help me.

00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:51.000
Fine. I'll get help.

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:55.240
Don't pull the knife out.
You'll only bleed quicker.

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:11.560
Nathan.

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:17.600
Don't speak.

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:18.680
It's okay.

00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:22.640
You'll be okay.

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:37.400
Hold it.

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:04.200
Come on. Come on, love.

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:17.360
Nathan. Thank God. I...

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:19.560
Nathan!

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:22.320
Fuck, Nathan!
Have you lost your fucking mind?

00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:26.360
Oh!

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:34.760
Nathan! Nathan!

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.440
Nathan.

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:23.080
I'm Blood.

00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:25.880
I'm just like him.

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:29.240
Look at me. You are not your father.

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:33.200
Blood. Fairborn.

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:36.520
Whatever.

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:39.000
You're a good boy,

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:42.600
and you've got nothing to be ashamed of.

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:46.400
What am I gonna do?

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:49.000
They'll be coming for you,

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:51.280
and they can do what they want with you.

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:53.680
I can run.

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:56.760
You won't make it on your own.

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:58.840
There's this witch I know of.

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:00.520
Mercury.

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:04.360
God help me,
I don't wanna do this.

00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:08.720
Should the time ever come
that you need it,

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:10.120
she can help.

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:12.360
Help with what?

00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:14.400
Whatever's coming, Nathan.

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:18.200
Okay, so let's go and talk to her.

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.040
Get to it then.

00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:21.120
What?

00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:23.040
Start reading.

00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:06.320
Gran?

00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:17.000
She's gone for now,

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:20.480
Nathan Byrne, son of Marcus Edge.

00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:24.280
Oh, yes, I know you,

00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:28.480
the bastard son of the very devil himself.

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:30.560
If the stories are to be believed.

00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:33.840
Well...

00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:36.720
there you go.

00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:39.360
You called me.

00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:44.080
Why?

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:46.000
My gran said that you could help me.

00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:48.440
Helping people is what I do, my dear.

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:50.360
What is it you need?

00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:51.360
I don't know.

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:55.120
Perhaps you need answers.
You want to know who you are.

00:44:55.200 --> 00:45:00.200
You want to know
if foul blood runs through your veins.

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:04.720
Tell me, when do you come of age?

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:06.600
I'm 17 in ten months.

00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:08.880
You'll be needing your family's blood.

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:11.760
- My gran will give it to me.
- Perhaps.

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:14.920
Perhaps not.

00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:18.480
A lot can happen in ten months.

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:22.400
Can you get me to safety?

00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:23.720
Mm.

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:26.160
I have a safe place.

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:28.560
Now, whether you can get there or not

00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:31.320
is an entirely different question.

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:34.680
- You're a Blood Witch, aren't you?
- Takes one to know one.

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:36.680
How do I find you?

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:45.800
- What are you doing?
- Drawing a map.

00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:56.200
When the time comes,

00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:58.600
just call for help.

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:06.680
A map to where?

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:10.080
<i>You know
about the prophecy, I expect?</i>

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:11.160
No.

00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:12.840
The prophecy.

00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:16.880
The reason they've kept you alive
so long, I'd imagine.

00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:20.240
<i>They hope it comes true, but if not,</i>

00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:23.840
<i>well, they aren't sure yet what to do,</i>

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:27.680
but they are certainly worried about you.

00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:31.640
I suppose that's why
there's so many of them outside.

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:33.040
We're moving now!

00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:35.360
Wh... What prophecy?

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:37.640
Go, go, go!

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:39.880
Our time is almost up.

00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:45.080
I hope I get to meet you properly
one day, Nathan Byrne,

00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:47.440
but I must say,

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:52.720
the chances aren't looking that good.

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:54.640
Hmm.

00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:03.400
When the time comes, just call for help.

00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:10.120
- Hey. Wait, wait!
- Nathan Byrne!

00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:13.760
This is the Fairborn Council.
You are surrounded.

00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:16.360
Come out with your hands up.
