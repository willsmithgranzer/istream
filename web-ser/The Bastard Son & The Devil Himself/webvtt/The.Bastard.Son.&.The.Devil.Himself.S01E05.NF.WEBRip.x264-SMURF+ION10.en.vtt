WEBVTT

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.400
He was a witch. Caravaggio.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.880
Did you know that?

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.920
Have you found anything?

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.640
We have to talk about Jessica.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.600
That business
with the pirate disturbed you.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.400
It disturbed me too.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.360
Of course it did.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.440
But Jessica has recognized
what others have not.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.200
Which is?

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.560
That we're fighting for our lives, Ceelia.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.960
That the rules have changed
and we're running out of time.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.560
Running out of time for what?

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.000
To stop the chaos.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.200
There was a fight
in a bar last night.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.960
Kieran picked up the trail of Nathan
and the Blood Witch.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.720
We're pretty certain
that Annalise is still with them.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.480
Let's go.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.000

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.760

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.480
Right.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.440
Why are we stopping here?

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.040
Annalise. Map.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.360
Okay.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.120
These are the Witch territories.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.120
Right now, we are on the border
of the Free State of Paris

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.400
and the Dupont region.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.920
Dupont is Fairborn.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.680
Fairborn-owned.
Fairborn-controlled. Fairborn-guarded.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.200
Over here is Ozanne territory.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.800
Ozannes are Bloods.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.440
Very hostile to outsiders.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.760
Loyal to Marcus?

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.440
Loyal to themselves, mostly.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.240
But there is a river, a day or so's walk,
and we can follow it to Mercury.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.040
What if the Ozannes catch us
sneaking through their territory?

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.840
They'll kill us, won't they?

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.160
Look, let's just go into this
with a positive mental attitude, shall we?

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.880
That's a yes.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.320

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.400

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.760
Thanks.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.560

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.040
Want me
to have a look at the map?

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.600
Mm, it's okay.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.600
Shall we sing a song?

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.600
Sing it in your head.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.040
I feel like
I could actually lead the way quite well.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.320
How much longer
are we gonna be walking for?

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.400
Yeah, how much longer?

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.680
I don't know, guys.
I'm not a GPS. Come on.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.600
Are we there yet?

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.880
I don't know.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.920
<i>♪ Whatcha, whatcha think of me? ♪</i>

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.440
Agh! Hate the countryside.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.200
I like it.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.160
Oh, yeah, of course you like it.
You're a country pumpkin.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.280
It's country bumpkin, idiot.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.080
What's a bumpkin?

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.760
I don't know what a bumpkin is.
I'm just saying that's the phrase.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.040
Yeah, fine, you're a bumpkin.
Good for you, huh?

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.376
Didn't you used
to go on romantic country walks

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.640
with your boyfriend?

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.720
No.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.440
Was he a Blood or Fairborn?

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.520
He was a fain.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.640
Yeah, how did that work?

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.640
We are all the same
under our clothes, darling.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.320
So, what?
You've never been with a fain girl?

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.960
Hmm. No.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.720
But you've been with a Fairborn?

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.600
Ha!

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.160
What about you? Are you a virgin too?

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.640
None of your business.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.080
Whoo! That's a no.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.760
The creepy Pagan shit
hanging in the trees...

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.320
Is that a good sign, do we think?

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.960
Okay.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.320
Shit.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.800
What happened?

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.160
Fairborn raid.
The Dupont, probably.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.600
Fairborns wouldn't do this.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.680
Why do you think Bloods fled for Europe
in the first place?

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.400
'Cause they were asked nicely?

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.680
We should keep moving.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:27.760
Yes, we should.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:29.960
Come on.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.800
What is it?

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.360
I thought I heard something.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.680
I... I don't hear anything.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.520
We have to move.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.360
Trust me.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.760
Gabriel, wait.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.640
On your knees.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:55.360
- We're just travelling through.
- Uninvited and unannounced.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.320
People have died for less.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.280
There are Fairborns on our lands now.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.040
They killed our kin just yesterday.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.880
We had nothing to do with that.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.280
We're Bloods. All of us.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.040
<i>Allez, venez!</i>

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.080
<i>Bouge.</i>

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.280
- What's happening?
- Just let me do the talking.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.480
All right?

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.640
We found them
in the North Woods.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.880
They say they're Bloods.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.840
You try to pass through
without permission?

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.200
We're running from the Fairborn Council.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.640
So you think to lead them here?

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.920
We were trying to get to the river.
Hoped to follow it east.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.760
I told Mercury
if she sent her people through here again,

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.840
she would have to pay.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.760
She doesn't know we're here.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.640
This one turns 17 in five days.
He needs his blood.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.560
What's your name?

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.280
They don't speak French.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.400
Our rules are very clear.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:36.000
You entered our lands
without announcing yourselves.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.320
You must turn around and leave
the same way you entered.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.240
If we turn back now,
we won't get to Mercury.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.800
My name is Nathan Byrne.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.560
My father is Marcus Edge.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.000
He has his eyes.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.920
Your father is a great man.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.520
It's an honor
to have you in our home, Nathan.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:51.920
We will guide you down the river,
but first, you must pay your way.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.640
Okay, let me see what I have.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.920
Max and Odette have their Giving Ceremony
tomorrow evening.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.520
You'll attend as our guest.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.080
Aww, that's a very sweet offer.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.600
Um, unfortunately,

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.520
we really don't have time to waste,
so, um...

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.320
It's not a request.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.240
I've heard so many things
about your father.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.200
He is a warrior, just like mine.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.960
I wonder which
of them has killed the most Fairborns.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.840
- What a delightful thought.
- Your dad likes killing Fairborns?

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.480
Whenever he gets a chance.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.840
There is lots to do.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.160
You said our presence would be an honor.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.400
You didn't say
we'd be moving the furniture.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:43.760
His presence is an honor.
You... not so sure.

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.080
We're happy to help.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.720
"I'm Nathan Byrne, son of Marcus Edge"?

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:53.640
Worked, didn't it?

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:55.776
Last group of Bloods
that found out tried to kill us.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.040
Gabriel's a Blood Witch.
He hasn't tried to kill us.

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.120
No, he just tried
to swap me for a children's book.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.960
- Oh, which I apologized for.
- If they find out I'm a Fairborn...

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:07.256
They'll only find out you're a Fairborn
if you don't stop bloody talking about it.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.520
We'll stay.
They'll take us where we need to go.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.120
Just keep your head down till then.
Christ!

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.080
Nice.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.720
- Stick together, all right, guys?
- Uh-huh.

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.040
Come on. Get to work.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:34.520
All right.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:36.720
Come on.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.920
Lift with your knees.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.360
- You all right?
- Yeah, it's just heavy.

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.480
- Mate, take one.
- Hmm.

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.520
- No, my back. My back. Seriously.
- Take the bag.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.480
Jesus, man.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Hi.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.000
If I'd have known
he was chasing us,

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.400
I wouldn't have tried
so hard to get away, huh?

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:05.480
Oh, for...

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.080
Oh, what, you don't think he looks good?

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.320
Looks like he's on steroids.

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.000
Well, not your type then.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.560
Well, no, obviously.

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:14.680
Obviously.

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:18.440
So, what is your type?

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.360
I don't know. I don't have a type.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.920
So, you'll screw anyone.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.840
That's not what I said.

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.920
Then you do have a type.
You just don't know what it is yet.

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:31.896
You think
about shagging all the time, don't you?

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.760
Ugh, "shagging."

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.080
Trust the British to come up with
the least sexy word for it.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:38.680
What's wrong with "shagging"?

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:40.480
It sounds like
something you do to a carpet.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:43.400
Yeah, what do the French call it?

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.080
<i>Faire l'amour.</i>

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.280
Fairly <i>amore?</i>

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.480
<i>Faire l'amour.</i>

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.960
I... I can't even pronounce that.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.880
Well, you just have to
get your tongue around it. That's all.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.400
Hey, I don't think about it any more
than you. I'm just not as ashamed of it.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.296
- I'm not ashamed.
- Oh, yeah, of what?

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:07.680
I don't know. Whatever the fuck it is
we're talking about right now.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.520
- Whatever. Come on, let's carry on.
- Hmm. Hmm.

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.240
<i>Don't you think
it's creepy here?</i>

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.360
- It's just an old house.
- "Just an old house"?

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:35.760
In the middle of nowhere.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.120
Full of witches.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.240
We're perfectly safe.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.320
You wouldn't live long
in a horror film.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.280
When did you learn how to do that?

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.800
Oh, when I was being kept
in a cage by the Fairborn Council.

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.920
- Who was it?
- What?

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.560
That, you know,
that... that you slept with.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.600
Oh.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.720
- Um, well...
- Oh. I'm sorry. It's none of my business.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:11.800
David.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.080
- Hmm?
- David.

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.320
Kind of a...

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.240
What?

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.216
- No, I don't know. It's just...
- What?

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.240
No, it's...

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.040
...just a weird looking guy,
innit?

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:27.760
Weird?

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:29.240
Yeah.

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:34.040
Always looked a bit like... like
he'd been stung by a bee or something.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.080
"Stung by a bee"?

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.240
Like he had an allergic reaction.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.960
Like his face was weird.

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:44.600
Right.

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.320
I'm gonna go.

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:49.920
Yeah.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.320
By the strength
of our roots...

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.000
May the blood blossom.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.160
To the friends at our table.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.040
And our enemies in the dark.

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.120
And the ones we love, who hunt them.

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.120
To the Blood.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.600
To the Blood.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.080
- Do you dance?
- No.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:19.200
I'll show you how.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:31.760
You have your powers
before your Giving Ceremony?

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:33.560
Twins share blood.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.240
Their abilities are heightened
even before they come of age.

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.760
Only one of us needs to drink blood
at the ceremony.

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.480
Yeah, you.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
No. You'll do it. I'm older.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:45.560
By two minutes.

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.160
Best two minutes of my life.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.240
Have you heard them yet?

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:00.760
The heartbeats.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:06.960
Your father could do it. So will you.

00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:16.040
My father stole other witches' powers.

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:17.680
Stolen?

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.840
They never taught you what it means,
did they?

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:23.200
They told me it was barbaric.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.400
When a witch dies,
their power dies with them.

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:32.200
So, those of us lucky enough
to have the gift

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:34.520
would take it and keep it inside of us

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:38.200
to one day hand it on to the next in line.

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:54.880
She holds hundreds of powers

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:59.560
handed down through generations
of Ozanne witches.

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:07.080
When she passes,
I will take of her blood and her heart.

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:10.200
And the powers will pass to me.

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.080
This way, we never lose our dead.

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.080
Not so barbaric, no?

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:21.080
My dad takes Fairborn powers
after he kills them.

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:24.360
He takes
what he believes he's owed.

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.640
How's it owed?

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:29.400
Marcus' mother was a heart eater.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:32.440
Her powers would have gone to him one day.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:37.840
The Fairborns killed her
and all the witches like her.

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:40.600
Burned their bodies.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:44.880
Made sure their gifts
were never passed on.

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:54.440
They tell the world
that we are the devils.

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:59.560
But they don't want people to know
that they made us this way.

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.640
Hi, Lucy. What is it?

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:16.200
For me? Is that me?

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:18.320
Yes.

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.360
- Ahh.
- Yeah?

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:21.280
Amazing.

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.560
Here you go.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.520
Where's the rest of it?

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:51.000
Sleep outside if it's too small.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:01.200
So, who wants the middle?

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.240
So, you are a heart eater?

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.000
I guess so.

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.360
- Fucking hell!
- Aww.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:57.040
Stop being such a baby. Come on.
Oh, Jesus Christ!

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.040
- What's up?
- We're good.

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:19.776
What are you gonna do
once you get us to Mercury?

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:23.520
Return to Paris and continue
my life of fabulous debauchery.

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:26.880
You should come and visit me
when this is over.

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.560
- You need to let your hair down.
- I can let my hair down.

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:30.640
Oh, yeah.

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.800
- I know how to have fun.
- Really?

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:36.840
Yeah, I'm fun.

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:38.320
- Okay.
- I am!

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.600
- No, no, I'll take your word for it.
- I'm a good time.

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.640
- People have told me this.
- Yeah, I bet they have. Yeah.

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:47.200
What time do you call this?

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.160
The others have been up for hours.

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:52.440
Darling, you're about
to discover a little concept

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.920
I like to call the brunch.
It's going to change your life.

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:59.160
You need to fill your stomach.
There's lots of work to do today.

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:02.800
I need someone to go to the henhouse
to get some chickens for the feast.

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:05.720
Oh, alas, my crippling
feather allergy prevents me.

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:06.800
We can go.

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.800
- How many do you need?
- Five.

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.680
- No problem.
- Thanks.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:12.760
Maybe I should come.

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:15.600
We'll be fine.

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:20.080
- That's a lot of chickens.
- We're going to need them.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:23.840
The others will be returning hungry
from hunting Fairborns.

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:26.200
Well, marvelous.

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:28.240
- Festivities begin at dusk?
- Yes.

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:31.880
If anyone needs me,
I shall be sunning myself by the river.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.040
Don't go far.

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:14.640
It's them.

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:19.800
Let's go.

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:27.600
Kieran.

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:31.480
Kieran, you haven't spoken to me all day.

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:34.240
Yeah, I'm tracking,
and I need to concentrate.

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:38.520
Look, if there's something on your mind,
then you should say it.

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:40.280
The guy on the boat.

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.280
Yeah?

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:43.360
It's just...

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:46.320
just a bit much. You know?

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.040
It's what we were trained for.

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:50.120
Yeah.

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:51.760
Hey.

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:56.040
The sooner we get this done,
the sooner we can go home.

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:45.160
Have you ever
caught a chicken before?

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.240
Yeah.

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.680
Do you like chickens?

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:05.080
I've got stuff on me.

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.720
Don't get it on me, man.

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:08.040
Oi, it could be shit!

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:09.240
It could be chicken poo.

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:11.200
Can we get back to what we've gotta do?

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:16.000
- That one, you'll be able to get.
- Yeah.

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.680
- They're getting a bit tired now.
- Yeah, maybe that's a plan.

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:25.000
I think we need to round them up.

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.160
Mother-cluckers.

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.760
You like it here, don't you?

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.760
It's the first place I've been
where I feel like I fit in.

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:47.840
It's the first place I've been
where I feel like

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:49.720
I don't.

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:57.520
Can you hear my heartbeat?

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:02.120
Always.

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:04.920
Always?

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.000
Yeah.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:21.840
Can you feel it?

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.360
Good.

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:36.400
- It doesn't mean I'm...
- You don't have to say it.

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.440
I know who you are, Nathan.

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:43.920
I always have.

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:18.840
Oh! Ooh!

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.040
Are you okay?

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:25.920
Oh, yeah. I'm fine.

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:33.280
Fucking hell.

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:34.200
It's okay.

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:35.520
Don't say it's okay.

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:40.240
I could have...

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000
Let's just go.

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:57.920
Aww, that's a sweet sight.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.400
Just two young lovers
taking their dead birds for a walk.

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:09.960
- What's up with her?
- Nothing.

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:15.320
<i>Faire l'amour,</i> huh?
You got your tongue round it, I see.

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:17.280
- What do you care?
- I don't.

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:31.480
- Gonna need more chickens.
- Zale.

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:33.320
Who's that?

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:37.040
Fairborn scum.

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:43.120
Welcome.

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:44.880
How are you, sweetheart?

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.776
- Welcome home, Dad.
- Ah.

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:51.080
How did you catch him?

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:52.440
There were four of them.

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:53.800
Don't say anything.

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.320
Dupont territory?

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:58.360
Two of them split off
and made it over the border.

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:00.080
- And?
- We caught the other two.

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:01.920
What happened to the other one?

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.960
Put a gun in his mouth. Coward.

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:11.440
Who's this?

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:18.920
Tell him who you are.

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:24.040
I'm Nathan Edge.

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:28.160
The son of Marcus.

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:35.320
It's an honor.

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.240
We drink!

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:53.240
- To the Blood!
- To the Blood!

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:56.880
Dad.

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:02.520
They call themselves the Fairborns.

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:04.760
And us,

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.120
they call us barbarians.

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:10.800
But they're the ones coming onto our land,

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:12.960
burning our homes and killing our kin.

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.160
Tonight,

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:20.680
the Fairborn will be returned to the wild.

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:22.960
Let his magic be freed from his body.

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:25.240
Let his spirit have a chance to soar.

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:46.440
Whatever happens,
don't look away.

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:55.720
What the hell is going on?

00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:59.320
No! No!

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:06.840
I beg you. No!

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:11.720
No! I beg of you! No!

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:39.800
Let his gift live on
in the blood of our children.

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:43.600
He is part of our future now.

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:15.960
What's the matter?

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:19.280
Have you never seen a Fairborn die before?

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.960
You asking
have I ever seen a man crushed to death

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:25.320
and have his heart eaten?

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:26.840
Yeah.

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:28.720
No, I haven't, actually.

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.520
We need to go.

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:34.960
Nathan. Nathan?

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.040
Nathan!

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:38.720
- Oh, my God!
- Nathan?

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.560
Are you okay?

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:42.896
What's going on?

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:46.000
How long
has he had these marks?

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:47.760
Four days.

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:50.200
Go to the storehouse.

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:54.280
Bring me some ash and arsenic.
Rum, if we have any.

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:11.640
Nathan.

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:13.160
A Witch's Bottle.

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:15.720
A what?

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:19.840
It's a parasite spell.
Made to steal a witch's power.

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:21.320
Nathan!

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:23.440
It requires two deaths.

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:26.000
From the bloodline of the witch
who casts it

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:28.440
and the witch you plan to use it on.

00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:29.640
Nathan!

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:33.416
- And the ingredients?
- I couldn't find anything.

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:36.280
He's getting worse.

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:47.320
Oh, shit.

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:48.560
Who the hell are you?

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:51.320
My name is Ceelia Bennet
of the Fairborn Council.

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:55.200
I'm unarmed.
And I'm here for Nathan and Annalise.

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:56.880
You want Nathan?

00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:58.360
Here he is.

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:05.480
Annalise,
you need to come with me.

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:07.200
Soul is waiting.

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:09.120
No, he did this!

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:14.960
Tell him I...
Tell him I never wanna see him again.

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.920
Tell us why
we should not kill you on the spot.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000
Because I did not come here alone.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000
Because this house is surrounded.

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:31.160
If we cannot resolve this peacefully,
then it will be resolved through force.

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:37.880
You come into my home
and threaten my family?

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:45.280
I come into your home to warn your family.

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:48.360
Get out.

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:50.760
Get out.

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:55.800
Get out!

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:05.360
Can't see anyone.

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:09.440
They'll be there.

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:16.760
They didn't go for it?

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:19.480
- Where's Soul?
- With Jessica.

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:23.160
I'll find Simone.
We're gonna need a healer.

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:30.480
No one fire on the barn
unless they fire on us.

00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:35.720
<i>All units ready your positions.</i>

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:37.720
Okay.

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:41.920
You're a Fairborn, aren't you?

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:44.640
We should give them the girl.

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:46.360
She is one of them.

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:47.840
Clearly, she is not.

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:49.600
Yes, she is.

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:50.760
Quiet!

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:52.320
We focus.

00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:58.720
We are Blood Witches!

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:02.280
Our powers are stronger.
Our will is stronger.

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:05.880
To the friends at our table,

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:08.640
our enemies in the dark

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:11.840
and the ones we love, who hunt them.
To the Blood!

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:14.120
- To the Blood!
- To the Blood.

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:15.920
Don't be afraid, little one, hmm?

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.200
I'm not, Daddy.

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:25.120
No!

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:29.520
Stop it!

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:33.600
Nathan! Nathan!

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:20.640
No! No!

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:31.000
Oh, my gosh!

00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:38.680
Nathan! Nathan! Nathan.

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:45.720
Sylvie. The boat.

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:51.080
Odette, come.
Help me with the trap door. Quick!

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:55.080
No! Get down!

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:58.840
- No! No!
- No, no!

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:00.680
Got to go.

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:04.336
- Go, go!
- Take his legs. Go.

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:06.040
- Come on.
- Nathan. Come on.

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:13.400
- Keep going, okay?
- Nathan. Come on. Go.

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:15.760
Come on, let's go!

00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:18.520
Okay, get the door!
Get the door.

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:23.240
This way to the boat.

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:25.840
Hurry. Move.

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:33.040
- Cease fire! My daughter's in there!
- Cease fire! Cease fire!

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:41.720
- We're here.
- Stop. Please.

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:44.120
Stop!

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:46.200
Stop right here.

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:47.360
It's just me.

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:50.000
We have to get him help.

00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:53.680
If you care about him,
get him on a fucking boat.

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:54.920
Come on, let's go!

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:58.240
Nathan, move!

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:15.000
Annalise. Ugh!

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:48.720
Annalise?

00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:52.040
Is Annalise...?

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:04.320
We're so close now.
