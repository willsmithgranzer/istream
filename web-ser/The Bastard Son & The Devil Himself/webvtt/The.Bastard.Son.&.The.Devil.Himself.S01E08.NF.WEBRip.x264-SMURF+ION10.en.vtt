WEBVTT

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.920
We came to you
because we had nowhere else to go.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.560
What can he do?

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.320
He can cook and clean.
He's a good boy.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.600
What can he do?

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.480
We think he will be an alchemist.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.816
- I already have an alchemist.
- He will be an exceptional witch.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.160
Every mother thinks this of their child.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.040
<i>How many of your clan
did the Fairborn kill?</i>

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.320
All but five.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.920
And where will you go now?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.360
We'll try to reach
our nearest family in Russia.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.456
Perhaps if
he were an exceptional witch...

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.120
...he would know the ingredients needed
to ease his father's pain.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.800
Gabriel, you know this.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.840
Silver root. Oakwood.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.080
Moss and stone and...

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.200
Lamb's blood.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.320
Yes, that would do it.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.160
Marie and Luc, I will take your boy

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.280
on the uncertain promise

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.480
he may develop
into something worth possessing.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.760
Our business here is concluded.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.000
No, I don't want you to go.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.600
It is the only way, Gabriel.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.720
Do not forget us. Ever.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.920
No, Momma...

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.960
We will come back for you one day.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.760
Remember that you are really brave.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.800
My son, be strong.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.640
Pap.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.520
I want my mom and dad.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.760
Dear Gabriel.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.080
You have no mother and father.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.520
Those were not your parents.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.440
They were just two people
you used to know.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.600
Just two more faces in the dark.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.400
Sometimes you will dream of names

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.840
and not remember why they were important.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.600
Write them down, Gabriel.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.600
If only to remind yourself
that something was taken from you.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.240
Yes.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.440
Come, you have chores.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.680
Hello, Nathan.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.200
He's here.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.240
His own blood
will kill the Wolf.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.280
Oh, shut the fuck up.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.760
"His own blood
will kill the Wolf"?

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.200
Fuck you. It's bollocks. All of it.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.320
This whole time, he's been trying
to get revenge. That's all.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.120
You wanna please him.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.200
The Hunters are in that house,
so go and fight them.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.320
Stop worrying about bullshit prophecies

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.040
and leave me the fuck alone.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.680
Fuck.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:17.880
Dad.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.080
He's here, Soul.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.760
You need her power.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:26.920
Dad, don't listen to her.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.080
Your Hunters can't stop him.
I can't stop him.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.080
How are you gonna stop him?

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.360
Ice? He's got that. Fire? He's got that.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.280
He's got every power you have,
except for hers.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.000
She can't wield it, but you can.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.280
He'll come in here,
and he'll tear you apart.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.560
He'll do it slowly.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.760
And then he'll take your daughter's power,

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.480
and there'll be no one left
who can stand in his way.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.040
He'll wipe out our kind
until there's nothing left.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.760
But you can save everyone.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.480
Soul, look at me.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.520
You can have everything.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.120
You just have to be strong now.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.680
Oh, my God, you are fucking insane.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.040
Do you even hear yourself?

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.200
Dad.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.040
Look at me.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:31.800
Look at me.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.320
It's not too late.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.280
You can still do the right thing.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.040
This is the only right thing!

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.320
You need to take her power.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.120
No, I know you're a good person.
I know you don't wanna do this.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.760
- You have to act now!
- Dad.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.160
There is no time.
The Wolf is at the door, Soul!

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.840
I'm sorry.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:03.960
Shit.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.120
Bloods!

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.200
I'll get her.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.040
Now you won't forget me.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.720
Nathan.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.040
Death to Fairborns!

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.800
I can't remember the fucking...

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.560
A journey of a thousand miles
begins with a simple step.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.280
To dare is to do.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.720
Cowards die many times
before their deaths.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.680
She changed the password.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.800
Go back to bed, you don't want her
to find you talking to me.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.680
I'll go home to my mother

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.480
when the journey is done

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.960
and return to my home as the prodigal son.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.600
Subtle.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.200
You have no idea how important this is.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.680
Thank you.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.280
There's a shortcut
back to the water tower.

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:02.840
The boy before me made it to run away.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.200
But he never used it.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.040
Where?

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:08.880
Under my bed.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.240
Why haven't you used it?

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.600
I'm afraid.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.240
You won't always be.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.920
I can't take you with me.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:25.680
I know.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.200
Will you believe me
when I say I'll come back for you?

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.320
I don't know.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.560
I promise.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.560
You're not leaving me, are you, Gabriel?

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.560
Yes.

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.280
But you promised you'd stay awhile.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.360
I can't.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.280
And where will you go to?

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.400
I'm going to help a boy kill a wolf.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.200
This place has seen so much death.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.720
The voices of the victims
are still in the walls.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.480
Their blood is still in the ground.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.600
Then let us hear them.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.040
Split up. Find their leader.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:36.640
Annalise.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:54.640
Annalise.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.560
<i>You know who I am?</i>

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.240
<i>It's over. Please.</i>

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:13.400
<i>Then let's talk.
Tell the Bloods they have their meeting.</i>

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:17.080
<i>Tell them to come to Wolfhagen.</i>

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.560
<i>Please.</i>

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:33.040
<i>I was told
you was an honorable man, Soul O'Brien.</i>

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.360
<i>Are you honorable?</i>

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.240
<i>We are here
to discuss a peaceful accord.</i>

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.200
<i>These are our terms.</i>

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
<i>All Blood Witches must cease
the practice of traditions</i>

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.680
<i>that contravene
the Assimilation Declaration.</i>

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.720
<i>All Blood Witches
must abide by Fairborn law.</i>

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:00.680
<i>All Blood Witches...</i>

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.040
<i>I must stop you there,
Council Leader.</i>

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.120
<i>You see,
I didn't come here representing the clan.</i>

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.960
<i>I came here representing my father.</i>

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.080
<i>My mother.</i>

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:25.120
<i>I came here representing
every Blood Witch that has lost their life</i>

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.680
<i>to the so-called Fairborn Council.</i>

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:32.280
<i>Every Blood Witch
whose land has been taken,</i>

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.200
<i>whose children have been murdered.</i>

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:38.160
<i>I came here seeking recompense
for the lives you've taken.</i>

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:41.040
<i>- And the powers you've stolen.
- </i>And the powers you've stolen.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.040
Stop!

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.400
You are not supposed to be here.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.520
Why aren't you with Annalise?

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.320
Why aren't you with Gabriel?

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.840
It was a good time to make a bad decision.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.040
It's the worst time
to make a bad decision.

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:30.960
Well, I'm here now.

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:32.920
Did you get your blood?

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.960
I remember the first time I met you.

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:42.880
So tiny and little.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:45.880
I picked you up.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.520
And you looked up at me
with your big eyes.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.400
And then you shit yourself.

00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.720
We have to stop him.

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.600
I was supposed to protect you.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.400
We can fight him together.

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.160
Go and find your friend.

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.280
<i>My mom and dad are in there.</i>

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:45.200
<i>What's your name, sweetheart?
What's your name?</i>

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:46.800
Ceelia.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:48.880
Don't be scared.

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:50.680
I'll protect you.

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:57.120
I thought I was hiding
from a monster in there.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.160
What happened to the man who hid with me?

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.400
I would have done anything for him.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.480
A scared man
that couldn't defend himself.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:13.120
Who had to listen
to his people being torn apart,

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.160
while he cowered in the dark
with a little girl.

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:18.800
There was honor in what you did.

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.280
Honor doesn't win wars.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.680
What does?

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.320
Monsters.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.320
That's what you learned in there?

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.440
Well, do you know what I learned?

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.880
I learned I'm not afraid of monsters.

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:32.720
Well, here we are.

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.640
Two witches in a cellar.

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.280
Playing a little game of hide-and-seek.

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:42.520
A little game
of let's cut out your fucking heart

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.200
and feed it to your dad.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:51.520
Just another day
in the whirlwind life of Annalise O'Brien.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.880
I thought maybe
I could come in here as Nathan.

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:03.640
But, nah. I don't need to hide who I am.

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:09.160
Because I don't think you've ever used
your power on someone willingly.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.480
When you really need to use your power,

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.320
and, princess,
you really need to use your power now,

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.200
I don't think you have it in you.

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:26.880
So here I am. No tricks, just honesty.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.880
And I'm honestly going to kill you,
Annalise.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:33.440
Slice you open, take out your heart.

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.080
And feed it to your father.

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:40.320
The Bloods think that
when your powers are passed on,

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.880
a small part of you lives on
inside the person that takes them.

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:46.880
I like that idea.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:51.560
I like the idea of you being stuck inside
your father for years and years,

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:57.560
just watching as he tears down
everything and everyone you love.

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:04.200
But then maybe I am...

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.160
What was it you called me?

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:10.440
"Fucking insane."

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:23.480
- You should have kept running.
- You should have let us go.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.480
You can't control it.

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:39.280
I don't want to hurt you.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.560
It's just you and me here.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:43.880
You can tell the truth.

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:48.840
That guard at the Council,
the Hunter at the ranch.

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.600
Think what we could do.

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:51.920
Just leave now.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.960
You're a Fairborn, Annalise.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.480
We could kill those savages upstairs.

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.560
You could fill the air with their blood.

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.120
I bet you can feel it, can't you?

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.840
I bet you can feel them
coming apart at your fingertips.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:14.680
You can't control your gift,
but Soul could.

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:15.760
Please go.

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.040
No one has to get hurt.

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:22.600
This isn't that kind of story.

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:49.120
Do it.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:04.880
Annalise.

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:21.160
- What are you doing here?
- You pushed me off a water tower.

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:23.440
Did you get my blood?

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.480
Yes.

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.160
See, I knew it would be okay.

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.360
Why did you kiss me?

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.920
'Cause I didn't know it would be okay.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:42.840
Drink it.

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:49.840
It's not dawn yet. Come on.
Annalise is here somewhere.

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.160
Get back!

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.800
Come on! This way!

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.560
Come on!

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.920
No, no, no, no.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:35.240
Gabriel.

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:37.280
You okay?

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:41.880
You're okay.

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:50.480
Oh, no.

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.080
Oh, no. Nathan.

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:06.920
It's all right. It's all right.
It's all right. It's all right.

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:15.480
You didn't bring a spare one,
by any chance?

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:19.400
No.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.280
Thought it was worth asking.

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:33.400
Come on.

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:46.560
You die today, Fairborn.

00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:58.360
Listen.

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.080
No howling.

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:04.920
No snarling.

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:09.920
Your wolf is not coming to save you.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Annalise.

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:27.920
Hey.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.480
It's okay.

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:31.760
We're here. We're here.

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:33.920
All right?

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:42.920
- Where's Ceelia?
- It's okay.

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.160
His own blood will kill the Wolf.

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:06.600
Ceelia.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.640
Ceelia. Hey. Hey!

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:11.800
Hey.

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:14.320
It's okay. It's okay. Just hold on.

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:18.360
Where is he?

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:21.360
Hunting.

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:25.200
Just hang on.

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:29.320
Please. Please.

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:42.200
To the friends at our table,

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.960
enemies in the dark...

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:51.320
and the ones we love who hunt them.

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:30.640
We need to go.

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:35.840
Go where?

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.440
To get your family blood.

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:16.960
Jessica.

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:19.480
Jessica!

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:45.360
Now what?

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:49.400
I'm all out of family members.

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:52.040
Oh, so you're just
going to sit down and die?

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:54.600
I can stand up and die
if it makes you feel better.

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.720
Your dad's still out there.

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:04.280
But you're not giving up.

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:33.600
We should think about
what we're gonna say.

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:35.360
What do you mean?

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:41.840
I mean, how many people get to know
when they're gonna die?

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:47.760
Most people probably go without saying
any of the things they wanna say.

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:51.080
So we should.

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:56.000
We all say the things we wanna say

00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:58.320
to each other.

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:00.360
Okay, you go first.

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:01.440
You go first.

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:03.720
- You're the one on the countdown.
- Low blow.

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:05.280
Okay, I'll go first.

00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:11.640
This has been...

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:15.360
fucking horrific.

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.400
But also...

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.616
...you know, kind of...

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:24.640
The bad times were the good times.

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:26.240
Yeah.

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:31.320
I mean, I don't know what's gonna happen

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:35.440
or how much time we have left together.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:41.000
I will think about... Oh!

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:46.280
I will think about you
every day for the rest of my life.

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:50.440
I love you.

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.760
Both.

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:54.840
Oh, fuck.

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.880
Well, what do you wanna say?

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:03.760
Don't really know.

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:06.840
- Beautiful.
- Aw, come on.

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:09.080
Let me
get that sewn on a pillow.

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:11.160
"Nathan Byrne. I don't really know."

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:13.680
Okay, okay.

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:18.280
I love you both too, all right?

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.080
It'd be a shit time to die.

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:39.440
You know what we should do?

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.520
Have a quiet night in.

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:46.440
Yeah?

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:49.680
Just get, like, a takeaway or something.

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:52.520
- Make a nice change.
- Yeah.

00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:55.560
No magic gunfights or nothing.

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:59.360
Maybe just watch a bit of telly.

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:00.960
What do you reckon?

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:16.320
I don't know where my dad is.

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:19.200
Fucked if I ever know where that guy is.

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:22.760
So, it's just you and me.

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:26.920
The Ozannes said you had
to kill someone from your own blood

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.640
to make the Witch's Bottle.

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:30.720
Who was it?

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:32.040
My brother.

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:34.160
Must play on your mind.

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:37.640
Maybe not.

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:41.760
You killed my mom.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:46.040
You killed my gran.
I ain't forgotten that.

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:47.640
Now I'm gonna kill you.

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:50.440
And your father.

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:55.160
All your bloodline. Root and branch.

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:56.600
You gonna freeze me?

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:57.680
No, no.

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:00.920
You're gonna be awake for this.

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:07.520
All right.

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:31.680
I'll find you!

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:35.360
I'll find you!

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:53.960
Hello, Nathan.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:10.440
If you're here to kill me,
just get it over with.

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.920
We don't need to talk first.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.320
I don't need to kill you.
You're already dying.

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:21.480
Guess the prophecy isn't true then.

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:29.200
What, "His own blood will kill the Wolf?"

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:33.880
We'll see.

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:40.160
Soul...

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:41.400
He won't find us.

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:44.040
Not for the time being anyway.

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:57.960
You're not so scary up close.

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:01.200
I think that might be
a matter of perspective.

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:10.000
Why did you kill all those people?

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.760
Do you wish to avenge them?

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:31.000
Most people, when they know it's coming,

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:32.640
they behave in the same way.

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:35.040
They lose themselves to their fear.

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:41.480
I killed this man once.

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:43.600
A Fairborn Witch.

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:47.960
Part of a hunting party
sent to look for me.

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:52.240
When I came for him, he was calm.

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:55.240
Eyes closed like he knew something.

00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:00.200
Man died with a smile on his face.

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:05.680
And I got his heart and found his power.

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:10.640
He knew how he was gonna die.

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:12.160
That was his power.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.560
There are many that would swap
all the riches in the world for that.

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:20.840
If he knew how he was gonna die,
why didn't he try and avoid it?

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:23.840
He knew that we all have
our time on this earth

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:26.720
and our part to play.

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:30.920
That was Mom's husband.

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:33.440
Yes.

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:38.000
- So, I went to her.
- Why?

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:41.400
Because I couldn't
stop thinking about the look on his face.

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:44.720
How he died like a man
that had known life.

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:51.000
She was nothing but good.
Nothing but light.

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:59.040
And I met her,
and I loved her, and she loved me.

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:00.880
Can you believe that?

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:06.960
It was everything.

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.280
And then they found us.

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:16.240
And I ran thinking that
they would leave her alone,

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.600
thinking they would leave you alone.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.680
Well, they fucking didn't, did they?

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:28.840
No. I was wrong.

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:31.080
So you have that gift now.

00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:33.960
You know how you die.

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:36.800
Yes, I know how I die.

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:39.960
And?

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:51.880
And it's not today.

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:57.000
Is the prophecy true?

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:00.520
It's your birthday.

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:03.800
You need your gifts.

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:07.920
And your blood.

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:33.680
My first gift to you

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:36.400
is your life.

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:40.760
I'm allowing you to have it.

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:42.800
Though many think I shouldn't.

00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:49.720
My second gift...

00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:54.280
is the last thing your mother said to me.

00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:02.840
She told me that she wasn't afraid
of who you'd become.

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:09.520
She wasn't concerned with
whether you'd be more her side

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:12.280
or my side
or what people would think of you.

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:17.080
She said, "I love him, Marcus."

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.760
"For the good and the bad,
I will love him like I love you."

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:31.520
"And I'll be here waiting
until you come back."

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:45.400
But you never came back.

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:01.800
No, I never did.

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:06.880
I need three gifts.

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:16.040
That man killed your mother.

00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:19.840
And your grandmother.

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:24.080
So now he needs killing.

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:28.040
- He's too powerful.
- Yes, he's got power.

00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:31.480
But his mind is weak.

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:34.600
He doesn't know who he really is.

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:44.160
So, my final gift to you is this.

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:53.960
The chance to see who you really are.

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:36.280
You got your blood.

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:37.960
Not all of it.

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:43.760
Where's your father?

00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:44.880
Gone.

00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:45.960
Gone?

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:48.160
Try not to take it personally.

00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:50.800
I just don't think
you're that important to him.

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:56.000
He left his son here to die alone.

00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:57.960
Let's find out.

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:37.160
His own blood will kill the Wolf!

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:40.320
Well, I have his blood in me.

00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:42.920
You can't stop it.

00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:51.280
It's my destiny!

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:03.600
Nathan.

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:13.160
They'll talk about you.

00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:19.520
They'll know I put an end to it.

00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:23.400
They'll know I had no choice.

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:25.560
No!

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:28.960
Nathan, run!

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:34.760
No!

00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:50.360
Dad.

00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:53.200
His own blood...

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:53.560
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:57.400
Who are you?

00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:02.440
Someone who likes to help people.

00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:08.800
I like to help people,
and you like to hurt people.

00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:15.240
Can you fix my power?

00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:16.960
No, dear.

00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:22.760
But I can get you revenge...

00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:26.120
<i>on the ones who broke it.</i>
