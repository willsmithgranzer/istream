00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.520
Nathan Byrne!

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.240
- This is the Fairborn Council!
- Nathan!

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.880
You are surrounded.
Come out with your hands up!

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.896
You are a Blood Witch, Nathan.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.440
By the laws of this land,

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.560
you're not permitted
to live within British borders.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.560
So, what you saying? Gonna kill him?

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.120
No.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.880
My family's power line is visions.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.680
My mother, she was a prophet
and a far more powerful witch than me.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.600
She wrote something on her last night.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.160
The same night you were born.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.000
"His own blood will kill the wolf."

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.080
A prophecy.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.400
So, no,
I'm not going to execute you, Nathan.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.360
I'm going to train you

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.360
because I believe
you are destined to fight your father.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.880
What if I say no?

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.360
This is ridiculous! You can't take him.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.240
He's only 16. He belongs here with me.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.520
It's okay, Gran. I'll be back. I promise.
Will you tell Annalise what's going on?

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.656
I think we can both agree it'd be best
for my daughter to be kept out of this.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.080
Okay, good. Let's go.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.160
Nathan secured.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.000
They train us
to kill Blood Witches.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.720
But you...

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.680
They want us to take you up north,
keep you safe.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.640
And we will.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.640
After this.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.040
- Right, over here.
- Right, let's go.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.200
We'll get your dad one day,
but this will do for now.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.920
Come on then!

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.400
You'll do, eh?

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.960
<i>♪ Do what I do, it's what I feel... ♪</i>

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.520

So, is there like
a Wi-Fi password or something?

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.360
No.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.200
Whoa.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.520
That smells disgusting.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.080
What we doing here really?

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.040
I'm going to train you
to fight your father.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.080
I don't expect, if you ever meet him,

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.920
that my training will keep you alive
for long, but those are my orders,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.760
so that's what I'm going to do,

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.280
and you're going to comply
because if you don't,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.320
then you're just another Blood Witch
in a land that doesn't want you.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:50.920
I'm not a Blood Witch.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.640
Fuck you. I'm not.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.640
Then what are you, Nathan?

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.280
I don't know.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.520
Well, we're going to find out.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.280
Where's my bedroom?

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.720
- Is this a joke?
- Cottage isn't big enough for both of us.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.120
- No shit. Look at the fucking size of you.
- This isn't a holiday camp. Toughen up.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.320
Never actually been to a holiday camp.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.040
Well, you won't know what you're missing.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.720
Throw your stuff in.
Training starts right away.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.000
We've got ten months
till you get your powers.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.680
Until then, you have your mind,
and you have your body,

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.520
and we can turn
both of those things into weapons.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.840
I can already fight.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.680
- How did you do earlier?
- Not fair. There was more of them than me.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.440
So you can only win fair fights?
That's not gonna be much use to us.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.480
No one can beat eight hunters
on their own.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.760
No one has fought your father and lived.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.880
Our purpose here is
to make the impossible possible.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:01.040
Hey, if you can teach me to
kick the shit out of eight of you fuckers,

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.120
then I'm all ears.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.680
Let's see how you get on
against one for now, yeah?

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.200
Hmm.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.880
- You have terrible technique.
- Fuck!

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.360
Mind and body, Nathan Byrne.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:26.880
Mind and body.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:36.000
How's the training going?
Is Kieran looking after you?

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.840
Yes, he's been good to me.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.280
The program's tough.
They work us very hard.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.200
Yes, we do.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.480
How are the other cadets treating you?

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.760
There's been some comments.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.440
My association with Nathan and...

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.680
And Marcus.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:00.840
Yes.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.280
You can't help that.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.200
No, but it hangs around my neck anyway.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.360
Well, we all have our baggage.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.760
Not like this.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:20.440
I was one of the architects
of the peace talks.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.520
You may have heard them referred to
by their more common title,

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.160
the Peace Massacre.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:31.120
There were many who are skeptical about
meeting the Bloods to discuss a truce.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.840
I thought we could do
something incredible.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.320
I thought we could change the world.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.440
But Marcus Edge had other ideas.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.760
I didn't realize. I'm sorry.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:49.000
Whatever good I do, whatever I achieve,

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:54.360
I'll always be the man
who invited the wolf into our home.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.400
You're a cadet in the armed wing
of the Fairborn Council.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.960
If the past hangs around your neck,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.120
pull it off.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:10.040
This is your time
to define who you really are.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.760
Ho, Nuno!

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.040
The objective of combat training
is to improve our skills,

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.960
not cripple our partners.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.040
Go again.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.240
The shadow of the wolf
spreads over Europe.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:41.640
You are the first line of defense
for the Fairborn community.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.800
So, you need to know your enemy.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.800
Blood Witches heal
ten times quicker than Fairborns.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:53.200
We use standard nine-millimeter bullets,
infused with composite spell formula

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.480
to bypass
their natural remedial capabilities.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.640
Hands up, whose core power is elixir?

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.640
Great. So, you might know better than me
what the fuck's in these things.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.920
What I can tell you is

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.760
if you hit a Blood with one,
they will know about it.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.600
They're not superhuman.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.080
We've killed a lot of them,
and we'll kill a lot more.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.680
Magic bullets.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.120
No one calls them that.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:49.920
Ow!

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.160
Fucking hell, man. Fucking hurt.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.160
Right, there's a natural circuit,
a five-mile run

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:01.800
if you follow the path.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.720
I'll be timing you.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.240
Not very fast.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.080
- Do it again.
- What?

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.720
Come on!

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.040
Nathan!

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.560
<i>I don't know why
they don't leave you alone.</i>

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.160
What if they're right though?

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.280
What if I'm a...

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.400
fucking Blood Witch?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.040
Nathan. You might be a Blood Witch.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.240
Or you might not be.

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.520
One thing you're not is your dad.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.440
When your brother
was trying to provoke me, I...

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.800
I wanted to hurt him.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.920
I wanted to really hurt him.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.040
Yeah.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.440
That... That's what being provoked means.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.640
Look, have you ever been into town
on a Friday night?

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.120
Moments of blind rage
are not unique to Blood Witches.

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.720
They're not unique to your father,

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.480
and they're not unique to you.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:56.080
Honestly, just stop
feeling sorry for yourself.

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.960
It is your least attractive quality.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.240
You think I have attractive qualities?

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.640
Shut up.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.040
Hello, Ms. Byrne.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.720
- I'm looking for Nathan. He...
- He's gone, love.

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:36.920
Gone where?

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.640
That's not your concern.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.520
But I... I am concerned...

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.360
You're a smart girl, Annalise.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:45.320
Don't come back here.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:47.840
Get on with your life.

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:08.360
<i>Go.</i>

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:12.360
Breathe.

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:16.160
<i>Focus!</i>

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.520
Focus.

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.000
Don't point the gun at me!

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:41.560
Fucking breathe, please!

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.960
Jessica, must do better.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:04.120
You know, with a few more weeks
training, you might even hit the target.

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:06.840
Hope we don't
get sent out together before then.

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.080
I hit the target plenty of times.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:13.080
We're meant to be the best of the best,
so plenty of times don't really cut it.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.360
Did your stepdad not teach you
how to kill properly?

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.440
I never met him.

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:21.200
Ah, well, you were only little.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.800
Probably just don't remember.

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:26.760
Maybe he tucked you into bed
before getting in with your mom.

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:30.520
Your power
is shape-shifting, right?

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:34.120
So why don't you try and shift into
someone who's not a fucking traitor?

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.400
Okay, screw you.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:45.760
- Oh!
- What?

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.560
Do I look like a traitor now?

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.440
Stop it.

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.040
Oh, don't be ashamed.

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.720
I think you look great.

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.520
I mean your boyfriend must be thrilled.
Couldn't believe...

00:16:58.600 --> 00:16:59.840
His luck.

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:03.320
Oh, yeah, he's definitely
punching above his weight.

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:08.000
Oh,
no wonder you seem so frustrated.

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:08.960
Stop it now.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:12.480
The next time you're alone with him,
you're gonna have that thought in mind.

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:14.240
What if it's not really him?

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:16.360
What if he suddenly...

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.080
changes?

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.040
Jesus Christ.

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.200
You wanna talk about daddy issues?

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.280
I can give you daddy issues.

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:29.800
You are fucking sick.

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.280
There is something wrong with you.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.200
Change back now.

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:35.280
Hmm.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.120
I hit the target plenty of times.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.600
And I'll hit it plenty more.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000

Hey, I just wanted to come and make sure
that you're, you know, doing all right.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:19.520
I'm doing fine.

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:26.000
So the whole Hazel situation...

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.520
She was... She was pretty upset.

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:30.560
So?

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:34.280
So maybe you could try
and smooth things over,

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:35.880
you know, for the good of the team?

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:40.240
As you've seen, my door's unlocked.
She's welcome to come and apologize.

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:42.240
Look, I know Hazel can be a bit difficult.

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.080
- But that's part of working...
- Kieran.

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:48.240
Your dad is a respected member
of the Fairborn community.

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.920
Your uncle is
head of the Fairborn Council Task Force.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.320
Your whole life has been one
of privilege and ease.

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.200
Jess, I worked hard to get in here.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.520
You passed a bleep test to get in here.

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.960
I worked hard.

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:06.920
My dad's dead.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:12.720
And my name will always be stained
by association with a monster.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.880
If I let them,
people will use that to tear me down.

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.760
They've been doing it my entire life.

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:22.760
So, she can come and apologize,
and I might let it go.

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.880
I don't show weakness, Kieran.

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.520
Some of us weren't born that lucky.

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.800
All right, I... I just wanted
to come make sure that you were...

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:40.760
you were okay, but I'll leave you to it.

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:43.240
You don't have to go
just 'cause I snapped at you.

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.080
You can stay.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:49.520
If you want.

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.680
I wanna call someone.

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:22.720
Who?

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.400
Annalise.

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:29.480
There's no phone reception here.

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:34.000
Why don't you draw yourself
a little picture?

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:41.280
- Give that back.
- No.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.080
You know what?

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.840
Fuck you! Fuck your stew,
fuck this cottage, fuck training!

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:51.040
I want to go home.

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:55.600
Okay.

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.760
You can go home.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.560
All you have to do is pick up this book.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:13.080
Fuck! Fuck!

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.960
Clean up your mess.

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:25.120
<i>You're running the track.</i>

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:38.360
Run it again.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.160
Run it... again.

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:12.960
<i>You're Nathan Byrne</i>.

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.280
<i>I'm not supposed to talk to you,</i>

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:17.480
but you seem all right...

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:20.240
considering.

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:58.160
You look just like him, you know.

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:06.840
Bjorn, what's going on?

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.240
We got a distress call
from a Council member in Wales.

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:12.000
We think it's Bloods.
Could be Marcus himself.

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:14.480
- Don't we have people stationed in Wales?
- We do.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:15.840
Then why are we going?

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:18.000
Because our people went
to investigate

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:19.400
and now we can't get hold of 'em.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.256
- Why don't we just call them?
- Into the truck.

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:23.200
Let's go!

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:25.800
- Let's go, we're moving now!
- All right!

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.736
<i>Hold position
until further notice.</i>

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:56.760
All right!

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:02.880
Go. Go quickly.
Positions now, mate.

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:11.880
Hold, hold, hold.

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.280
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:46.120
Help! Help me!

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:49.960
Don't touch her.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.280
God, Jesus.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.320
Suffocation curses are fast-acting.
They'll still be close.

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:16.920
Wait!

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:32.480
Oh, fuck's sake.

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:34.000
Looks like we found the first team.

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.720
This is Team Leader requesting
backup units on site.

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.296
We're gonna need a cleanup team as well.

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.840
- What about the bodies?
- They'll torch the house.

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.080
Unless you think
you can explain ten corpses

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:51.200
and a woman without a mouth to the fains.

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:52.960
- Pick up anything?
- Hmm.

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:38.680
They went this way.

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:42.600
Annalise, on the day
of your 17th birthday,

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:44.720
I give you your first gift.

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:46.120
Thank you.

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:53.600
I give you your second gift.

00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.200
I give you your third gift.

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:01.040
This was my father's.

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:03.120
Then it was mine.

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.240
Now it's yours.

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:07.640
If your brother asks,
tell him I got it off eBay.

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:09.440
Thank you. It's beautiful.

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:10.520
All right.

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:13.280
You ready?

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:27.080
And now,

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.840
your family's blood runs through you.

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.520
Take of it and become whole.

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:34.800
Well done!

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:40.200
- Well done. Well done.
- Thanks, Dad.

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:48.120
When it was my giving ceremony,
your father was so jealous

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:49.280
that, uh...

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:52.240
...he tried
to cut his own finger all by himself.

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:55.480
We've sent everyone we have
over there as backup.

00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:58.920
How did they manage
to take out an entire squad?

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:05.240
A whole squad of hunters.

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:07.280
- I don't know.
- Was he with them?

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:09.120
Marcus?

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:11.880
It's unlikely.

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:14.920
I mean, it's not like she was one of the...

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.880
Not like she was one of the Ten.

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:20.800
It should be the 12.

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:25.160
He spent the last two decades
hunting down the ten that gave the order.

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:26.560
What do you think he's gonna do

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:29.760
when he finds out that
the two of us actually carried it out?

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:30.840
You're both safe.

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:34.080
Your identities will die with me.

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:35.960
Whenever the day comes.

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:43.440
Well, either way,
I doubt he was there.

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:46.600
Her heart was still in her chest,
for one thing.

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:49.840
I mean,
that's usually a pretty big giveaway.

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:53.360
Hey, um,
Dad, Mom wants us to cut the cake.

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:55.360
Oh. Yes, of course, love.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.920
Beautiful ceremony, Annalise.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.760
Soul, your daughter
really is quite charming.

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:40.280
What's the point?

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:42.800
I'm never gonna beat him in a fight.
What's the fucking point?

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:48.600
A month ago, you wouldn't
have been able to do that.

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:52.200
Imagine what
you'll be able to do next month.

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:01.480
<i>Hey, Beef.</i>

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.720
<i>Giving Day today.</i>

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:06.240
What do you think my power's gonna be?

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:12.080
Maybe I can make animals talk.

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:23.120
Speak. Speak.

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:26.640
Fine,

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:28.720
be like that.

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:31.760
Strong, quiet type.

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.800
I thought he might have written.

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:44.160
Being my birthday and all.

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:46.240
Wouldn't kill him, would it?

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:49.640
Just a little letter...

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:52.480
...just to say hello.

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:56.560
"I'm still alive."

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:00.240
Speak.

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:06.040
Okay. Yeah, you're not gonna do it.

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:09.360
See you later, pal.

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:21.440
<i>♪ ...after dark, it's my point of view... ♪</i>

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:24.560
Annalise, it's your turn.

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.920
<i>♪ Always coming
And you'd never have a clue ♪</i>

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.680
<i>♪ I never look behind, all the time
I will wait forever... ♪</i>

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:34.400
Oh! One!

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.760
Hey, I got you something.

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:39.600
It's a puppy.

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.600
Okay.

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:43.240
Hope he's still alive.

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:47.120
Right. You might've wanted to put
some air holes in here or something.

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:50.840
- Because you always...
- Always smash my phone.

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:55.760
You're on here.

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:58.720
Well, I wanted to make sure
you remembered me.

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:01.320
Thank you.

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:03.160
Really.

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.840
You know,
you really are strikingly beautiful.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000
That's a bowling pun.

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:11.560
Thank you.

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:14.040
You have very heavy balls.

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:19.400
It's also a bowling pun.
It's the best I could think of. Sorry.

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:21.640
- Just gonna...
- That was cringe.

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:45.000
That was fun. You are terrible at bowling.

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:48.200
Shut up! I've never done it without the...

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:51.000
Oh, my God, what are they called?
The sausages down the sides.

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:52.680
The gutter guards.

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:56.440
Okay, well we professional bowlers
like to call them sausages, but okay.

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:58.440
I was thinking about, you know,

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:03.160
what happened last time
we were in this car.

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.480
Yeah.

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:07.480
I remember.

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:08.960
It was fun.

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:11.200
We should do that again.

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:13.280
Yeah, it... it was nice.

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:16.600
But?

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:17.760
Uh...

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:22.000
I... I don't know. I...

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:25.640
I don't really know what I want right now.

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:31.600
It seemed like you did
when we were together.

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:33.720
Sorry.

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:44.400
David.

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:52.080
David. David!

00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:57.920
What are you doing?

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:01.720
Make it stop!

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:24.080
The trail ends here.

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:27.080
Four teams. Close the square.

00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:29.960
First team on Jessica.
Third team on Kieran.

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:33.280
Fourth with Flo. Second on me.

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:36.040
No one gets away.

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:39.720
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:09.400
Left, to the left!

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.120
I got here too late.

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:16.040
Annalise.

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:19.440
Oh, my head.

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:22.520
You were in a car accident.

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:24.880
Where's David?

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:26.280
He's down the hall.

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:28.240
He was pretty badly hurt.

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.520
Is he gonna be okay?

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:31.120
He's gonna be fine.

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:33.320
Do you remember what happened?

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:36.760
Make it stop!

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:38.720
Not really.

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:41.280
Well, the most important thing is
you're okay.

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:44.440
Sorry, have to go.

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:46.560
I'll be back later with some magazines

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:48.880
and those horrible chocolates you like.

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:52.520
See you later.

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:55.800
Sir, we got them.

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:57.920
Excellent. Good work.

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:01.840
<i>I'm afraid we suffered some casualties.
One of the new recruits.</i>

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:03.640
Not Jessica?

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:07.200
No, uh, Cadet Hazel Clark.

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:11.800
Okay, I'm gonna see Reutger now,
give her the good news in person.

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:13.760
Well done.

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:40.120
- Aoife.
- I came as soon as...

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:43.360
It's Marcus.

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:45.360
Where were the guards?

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:48.360
We found
a few bits of them in the garden.

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:50.880
There was an insurgency in Wales.

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:53.640
We sent most
of our local protection detail there.

00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:54.880
You think it was a diversion?

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:57.160
If it was, it worked.

00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:59.600
The last of the Ten.

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:02.240
Are we safe?

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:09.520
- Seven of her fingers are broken.
- What does that mean?

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:12.640
It means that's how long it took
before she gave us up.

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:14.776
- He knows about us. We have to run.
- I'm not running.

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:17.280
My power is illumination.
Yours is growing bloody plants.

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:19.840
If the head of the council wasn't safe,
what chance do we have?

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:28.040
We're not as... powerless as...
as you might think.

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:32.760
There are ways.

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:36.040
What ways?

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:41.880
No, it's... Yeah, sorry,
you should... you should go. It's...

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:44.720
It's not safe
for you here anymore.

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:49.120
One mistake and a life spent
looking over our shoulders.

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:50.560
We were just following orders.

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:52.880
Yeah, well, now they're following us.

00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:06.320
"His own blood will kill the wolf."

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:09.560
The boy.

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:13.120
If Marcus knows about the prophecy now...

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:16.800
he'll be after him too.

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:40.120
What's going on?

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:42.040
Reutger Sillwood is dead.

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:44.320
It was your dad.

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:47.440
- So what are they doing here?
- Been ordered to provide extra protection.

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:49.920
There's a concern
that your father may believe

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.360
that you're a danger to him now.

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:53.520
He may come here looking for you.

00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:58.680
- How's training going, sunshine?
- Fine. You wanna fucking fight?

00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:01.720
Come on, mate.

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:03.560
Okay, happy to.

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:05.400
Right.

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:14.840
It reflects poorly on me
when you get beaten so easily.

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:17.120
Well, maybe
you should train me better then.

00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:24.560
Do you think
my dad's really on his way here?

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:26.400
I have no idea what your father's doing.

00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:28.880
Maybe he'll come to rescue me.

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:30.920
He wouldn't be coming to rescue you.

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:38.000
- You learned a new recipe.
- Hmm. Fill my time somehow.

00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:40.640
Thought you filled your time
beating the crap out of me. Cutlery.

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:44.640
That's the days.
The nights I have nothing to do.

00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:46.520
- Try sleeping.
- I don't sleep.

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:47.600
Why not?

00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:49.240
Bad dreams.

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:54.160
Maybe you should, like,
listen to a whale song or something.

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:56.520
Thanks for the tip.

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:05.920
You said I look just like him.

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:08.800
What?

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:12.240
My dad.

00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:16.280
You said that I look just like him.

00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:18.880
So you must have seen him then.

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:25.680
I was 11.

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:29.040
My parents both worked
for the Fairborn Council.

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:33.160
They were called
to a very important meeting.

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:36.000
To discuss peace.

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:38.200
The massacre.

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:43.200
They were excited to bring me along.

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:48.000
Told me I was going to witness history.

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:51.960
Well, they weren't wrong.

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:55.920
It was an old house called Wolfhagen,

00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:57.920
in Germany.

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:01.600
Neutral territory.

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:04.640
My mother carried me in.

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:09.000
She put me in a chair
at the back of the hall

00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:11.680
and told me to be very quiet.

00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:18.640
I remember him coming in.

00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:23.520
The way he looked at everyone.

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:26.280
And smiled.

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:31.800
Then he turned.

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:35.240
He became the wolf.

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:38.240
And he killed every one of them.

00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:41.480
What did you do?

00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:51.760
I hid.

00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:57.000
Because I was just a child.

00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:01.960
And I was afraid.

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:06.080
What about now?

00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:10.520
Are you still afraid?

00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:04.840
What are your weaknesses?

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:07.200
Hmm?

00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:09.080
You're tired. You're slow.

00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:11.280
You're not concentrating.

00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:13.160
What are my weaknesses?

00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:16.360
Underestimating me.

00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:28.480
Your father
can control rock and water.

00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:31.400
He can change shape into other creatures.

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:34.200
He can increase his size and speed.

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:37.720
Survive most wounds. Control weather.

00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:39.920
<i>He can make potions.</i>

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.400
<i>He can manipulate the heat and the cold.</i>

00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:46.400
<i>He can take the power
of any witch in the world.</i>

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:50.400
<i>It's his greatest gift
and his greatest weapon against us.</i>

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:54.640
<i>The more of us he kills,
the stronger he becomes.</i>

00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:14.280
I'm going to the office.
Stay here and watch the family.

00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:15.360
Yes, sir.

00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:07.600
Hello, Soul.

00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:09.560
Hello, Rowan.

00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:15.280
I've never understood a man
who can grow whatever he wants

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:19.000
with the touch of his finger
spending so long gardening.

00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:20.840
Ah, it's the old ways, brother.

00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:27.480
I heard about Reutger.

00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:30.680
Terrible tragedy.

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:33.800
It was Marcus.

00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:37.360
Yeah, yeah, big cross of blood.

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:39.400
Heart ripped out of the chest.

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:41.440
He certainly has his methods.

00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:46.680
He's hunting you, isn't he?

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:52.080
What are you gonna do?

00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:53.440
I'm gonna fight.

00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:02.440
You know,
I've always liked our family's power,

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:06.360
but even I can acknowledge
its relative ineffectiveness,

00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:07.920
when it comes to a fight.

00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:11.520
Especially against a man like Marcus Edge.

00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:18.920
Do you remember a book our father had?

00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:23.280
You found it one time
when we were playing in his study.

00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:26.840
It had a leather cover
with a symbol on it.

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:30.920
I remember.

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:36.200
And I remember
he beat us both just for looking at it.

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:38.280
Yeah.

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:45.000
I kept it.

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:47.160
When he died.

00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:52.360
I've still got it.

00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:54.160
That old magic is dead, Soul.

00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:56.760
It should stay dead.

00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.800
I only wish I had a choice.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.000
I'm sorry.

00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:19.160
I'm sorry.

00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:29.320
I'm so sorry.

00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:57.120
What is it?

00:50:58.800 --> 00:50:59.920
Nothing.

00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:04.040
Quickest time yet. Do it again.
