WEBVTT

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.760
What are you doing here?

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.160
I got here too late.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.680
Uncle.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.520
<i>Kieran, I'm afraid I have
some awful news about your father.</i>

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.120
I was thinking.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.640
My left hand is still weak,
and I know I've been dropping it.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.560
We should work on that.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.360
Nathan, your grandmother is dead.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.840
She took her own life.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.640
So how...

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.000
She brewed a potion.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.680
A Scarlet Kiss.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.800
You heal quickly, Nathan Byrne.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.040
Don't forget that.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.720
<i>Nathan.</i>

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.760
You are not your father.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.000
You're a good boy.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.320
Blood...

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.880
<i>Fairborn...</i>

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.560
<i>Whatever.</i>

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.000
Reutger Sillwood is dead.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.760
My brother is dead.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.280
My colleague in the Fairborn Council,
along with her husband

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.120
and a whole squad
of Fairborn hunters are dead.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.200
Your grandmother is dead.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.560
I put these deaths
at the feet of your father.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.816
Well, you've got me
training to kill him, so...

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.880
That was Reutger's plan. There's a new
plan now. You're coming back with us.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.160
He's not ready.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.960
- He doesn't need to be.
- I wanna stay here. I wanna keep training.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.600
I wanna fight him.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.800
- Soul.
- It's been decided, Ceelia.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.880
- Clean up here and head back.
- Soul, who's in charge?

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.960
We're determining that.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.920
You going to Gran's funeral?

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.000
Nah, probably too busy
with your new friends.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.480
I don't know if I said this to any of you,

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.200
but I love the uniforms.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.840
It's like Hitler Youth does paintball.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.560
It's brilliant.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.200
Was Boohoo doing a run on sports jackets?

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.600
Can you shut the fuck up?

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.800
What the fuck?

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.280
Oh, my fucking God.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.080
Keep driving. Go past.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.920
Keep going. Go past them.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:13.960
Keep driving.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.000
What the fuck! It's Marcus.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.160
Drive! Drive!

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.000
Hurry.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.720
Shit! Shit!

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.520
Shit.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.360
Fuck. It's him.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:46.680
Go past them. Go!

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.080
Keep going. Keep going round.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.160
Go, go!

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.440
Holy fuck.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.560
Get out. Get out!

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.720
Get out!

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:31.120
It's him. Stay alert!

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.480
Shoot on sight!

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.960
It's him. He was here. Your dad!

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:54.680
Fuck!

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.680
Shh! Keep quiet.

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.520
- That was my dad, wasn't it?
- Yes.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.560
I just thought...

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.360
...maybe he'd...

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.480
What?

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:36.320
He'd come up and give you a hug,
tell you he missed you?

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.280
It's not that kind of story, Nathan.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.520
You're not supposed
to be doing this, are you?

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.520
I'm not going any further
until you tell me...

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.280
God!

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.120
You hear heartbeats, don't you?

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.160
I can see it in you.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.480
You're a heart eater.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.200
A taker of powers.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.520
I'm not my father.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.720
You know,
I remember the first time I met him.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:49.480
They say you shouldn't let
your power define you, but, uh,

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:54.120
it's hard not to feel slightly inadequate
when you stand next to a man

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.320
that can rip the magic
out of a witch's heart

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.040
and take it as his own.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:03.960
And all you can do is
grow weeds out of the ground.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.920
Maybe you should speak
to a therapist about that

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.640
after you untie me from this fucking bed.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.920
Whose blood is that?

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.680
"His own blood will kill the wolf."

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.520
The coming dark and the waning light.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.040
The promise of pain and endless night.

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.520
What does that mean?

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.600
It's a spell.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.960
For what?

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.560
It's called a Witch's Bottle.

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.280
It's dark magic. Forbidden.

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.000
Why is it forbidden?

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.040
Because of the terrible things it does.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.160
And the terrible things
you must do to cast it.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:20.160
It's okay. It's okay.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.520
It's okay.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:31.960
There we go.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.080
We're done for now.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.240
Wait! Where are you going?

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.040
What happens now?

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:59.480
When it's ready,
I'll be back to finish the spell.

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.040
How do you finish the spell?

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:03.720
You'll see.

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:10.120
Yeah, the fuck I will.

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:12.720
Hey.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.360
You stay where you are.

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.160
Stay there now. Don't move.

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.160
Don't do anything stupid.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.800
I said, don't move.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.360
Annalise.

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:49.840
Nathan?

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:53.280
Nathan! Nathan!

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.800
He's fucking lost it.

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.480
Nathan.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:34.200
Have you heard anything about Nathan?

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:36.880
What?

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:42.120
I just assumed
you'd have people looking for him.

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:47.360
I think it's best
you forget about that boy, Annalise.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.800
Darling, it's been months.

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.680
Maybe he doesn't want to be found.

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.680
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:02.760
You coming?

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:05.880
Revision club.
All the cool kids are gonna be there.

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:07.960
- Really?
- No.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:09.800
Just us.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.640
It'll take your mind off things.

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:23.000
<i>I'm looking for Nathan.</i>

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.600
Don't come back here.

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.280
Get on with your life.

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:39.200
How do you think you did?

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.160
I don't know. Okay.

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.760
- What about you?
- Smashed it.

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:46.720
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.200
Weren't you predicted to do super average?

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.920
- Predictions can be wrong.
- Oh, can they?

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.680
Yeah. Like I predicted at the start
of the year that you wouldn't kiss me.

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:00.480
And now I feel like you might.

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:01.600
Wow.

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:04.080
You're very cocky.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.520
Do you like it?

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:08.200
Not usually.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:12.960
So, am I right?

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:18.040
Would you kiss me,
or are you still pining for you-know-who?

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:19.680
"Pining"?

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:21.840
Yeah.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.240
It's loud here.

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:32.400
Do you wanna go somewhere else?

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:38.400
Wait a second.
Over there. Come on.

How are you feeling?

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.640
A little nervous.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.160
There's nothing to it.

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.520
What do you think my power's gonna be?

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:30.360
A mother who can control water.
A father who can grow plants.

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:33.720
Maybe you'll make pond weed.

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:35.840
Ha ha.

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:39.040
Whatever it is,

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:43.320
I know you're gonna use it
to do great things.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.520
Come on. Hurry up. Get ready.

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:48.320
Yeah, yeah.

On the day of your 17th birthday,

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:56.160
I give you your first gift.

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.240
Second gift. Your third gift.

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.240
This was my father's. Then it was mine.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:02.560
Now it's yours.

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:04.840
Your family's blood runs through you.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:42.800
<i>What are you doing?</i>

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.440
Make it stop!

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:15.920
Annalise.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.240
We have guards now?

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.640
There's been another attack.
Several, actually.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.560
Reutger Sillwood was killed.

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:37.440
Oh, my God.

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:39.560
You don't have to worry.
We're perfectly safe.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.776
But if he can get to the head
of the Fairborn Council...

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:44.280
Hey, I promise.

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:46.360
I'm not gonna let anything bad happen.

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:49.640
You need to worry about getting
your strength back and nothing else.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.240
Okay?

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:54.320
Come on. Let's get you cleaned up.

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:07.240
We're just next door if you need us.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:14.240
I have to ask.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.280
Have you felt any...

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:19.360
twinges?

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:20.440
"Twinges"?

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:21.920
Of your power.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:23.800
Oh, um,

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.200
no.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.400
No twinges.

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.400
Well, it will come.

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:32.640
When it's ready.

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:34.920
Good night, darling.

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.760
<i>Make it stop!</i>

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.560
Come on. Come on. Come on.

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.080
Grow!

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:08.240
Holy fucking shit.

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:24.920
- What have you spilled?
- Uh...

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.600
- A cup of tea.
- Annalise.

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.400
I'm sorry.

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:32.440
Why we put cream carpets
in your room, I'll never know.

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:44.840
Sorry, buddy.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.720
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.600
<i>What do you think my power's gonna be?</i>

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:29.960
<i>Whatever it is,</i>

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:32.800
<i>I know you're gonna use it
to do great things.</i>

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:38.080
- David.
- Mm-hmm.

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:43.000
- David!
- David!

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.880
Make it stop!

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:18.040
<i>Dr. McGarvey,
operating room nine, please.</i>

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:20.600
<i>Dr. McGarvey, operating room nine.</i>

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:30.760
<i>Annalise.</i>

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:45.960
David, what do you remember
from the accident?

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.320
Nothing.

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:49.920
- David, I...
- We were driving and then...

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.120
Yeah, and then
you put your hand on my leg.

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.800
- I wasn't trying...
- For fuck's sake...

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.640
- Asking what you remember from the crash.
- Pain.

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:03.320
I remember pain.

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.760
<i>Inside me. Like I was...</i>

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:13.120
Like I was...

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.800
Coming apart?

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:32.120
<i>- When did it stop?
- </i>When we crashed.

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:35.280
When I blacked out.

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:41.680
<i>I think it's best
you forget about that boy.</i>

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.800
<i>Maybe he doesn't want to be found.</i>

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:45.880
Annalise.

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:49.120
- What are you doing in here?
<i>- </i>Sorry.

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:01.480
I'm going to the office.
Stay here and watch the family.

I haven't seen for some time.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:24.560
Hey, Steve.

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:27.000
Hey, your dad's not here,
as far as I know.

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:29.960
Oh, that's okay. I actually
just wanted to come use the library.

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:33.040
Well, strictly speaking, I shouldn't.

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:35.200
We're on something of a lockdown.

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:36.320
Oh.

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:39.440
I suppose half an hour won't hurt.

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:42.360
Go on. I presume you remember where it is.

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:43.880
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.920
Stay there now. Don't move.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.160
Don't do anything stupid.
I said, don't move!

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:31.760
Annalise.

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:41.120
Stop!

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:42.040
Run.

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:51.400
Oh, God!

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:53.320
Shit.

00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:20.680
That way. That way!

00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:29.160
Fuck it!

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:04.520
Jesus fucking Christ.

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:09.080
I just killed someone.

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:11.160
- Annalise. Listen. Hey.
- Please.

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.960
Don't touch me.

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:17.800
I don't wanna hurt you.

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.440
You won't hurt me.

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.040
I'm a fucking monster.

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:34.440
You didn't mean to do it.

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:36.400
That's all that matters.

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:38.960
All right?

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:45.920
My dad told me you'd run away.

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:49.840
They had me training. Up north somewhere.

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:52.800
- Training for what?
- They wanted me to fight my father.

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.440
Are you joking?

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:57.200
- There was a prophecy.
- What?

00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:00.120
That you would fight one of the
most powerful witches that's ever lived?

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:02.920
That's just about the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.760
Training was going quite well, actually.

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:06.400
Well, it would have to have been.

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:10.480
Well, anyway.

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:13.680
Plan changed.

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:15.960
What is it?

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:18.720
Your dad said it's a forbidden spell.

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:23.760
That's all I know.

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:26.760
What has he done?

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:33.560
It's your Giving Day in a week.
If you don't get your blood, you'll die.

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:35.680
What are we gonna do?

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:40.600
It's a map.

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:41.560
What?

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:45.520
A witch called Mercury spoke to me
just before the Fairborn Council took me.

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:48.040
She said if I ever needed help,
I just had to ask for it.

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:49.720
And this map would guide me to her.

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:50.840
Who's Mercury?

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:51.840
Don't really know.

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:54.520
- And what does she want with you?
- I don't know that either.

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:55.960
How does the map work?

00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:58.320
- You don't know.
- No.

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:05.680
Just... Just ask for help
and the map will guide you.

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.200
Help.

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:25.400
Help! Help! Help! Help!

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:26.536
- Oi!
- Help.

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:28.960
If you're just gonna sit there,
shouting like idiots,

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:30.920
you can piss off outside.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.000
Sorry.

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:22.640
But there's no 186.

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:24.560
It should be here.

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:39.640
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:48.160
I've never met a... Blood Witch before.

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:51.440
What if they're...

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:52.480
What?

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:55.120
Like, what if they're...

00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:57.080
You know.

00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:58.760
Bad.

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:02.000
We're fucking bad.

There was a map.

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:35.720
On my hand.

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:39.520

Well, there it is.

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:54.880
I've been wondering
when you were going to show up.

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:55.960
Been expecting us?

00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:58.240
Well, I've been expecting <i>him,</i>

00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:00.800
which is to say, I was told
that a young witch would be

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:03.280
seeking me out
at a time of his own convenience.

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:07.400
No one said anything
about, um, whatever this is.

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:09.960
I'm Annalise.

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:11.560
Oh, good evening, Annalise.

00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:14.960
I'm Gabriel.
I work for a witch called Mercury.

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:17.680
And Mercury has offered her assistance

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:19.280
to our gawping friend here.

00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:21.400
He needs his family blood.

00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:24.080
Well, she has samples
from all the witch families,

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:26.400
so shouldn't be a problem
getting you sorted.

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:32.840
Why does she have blood samples
from all the witch families?

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:36.000
Because, um, desperate witches
will pay handsomely for them.

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:37.480
Who is Mercury?

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:42.320
She's a witch who can get you things,
like a vial of blood, a rare gemstone...

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.200
All kind of powders.

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:49.280
And potions.

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:52.480
Can she change someone's power?

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:56.440
- Why do you ask?
- 'Cause I'm interested.

00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:58.840
Is it related to the blood in your hair?

00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:03.120
Anything is possible.

00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:07.960
- Where is she?
- Far away.

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:11.040
First, we must get to Paris
and then travel on from there.

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:13.480
Paris, France?

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:15.640
Yes, dear. Paris, France.

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:19.360
Uh, now, I have a bathroom
and a single spare towel,

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:21.560
which you may both use,

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:25.600
so why don't you go and clean up
while I make preparations?

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:27.680
- Preparations?
- Yeah, for the journey.

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:31.320
- To Paris?
- Yes, to Paris.

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:36.480
Don't you wanna ask
why we're covered in blood?

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.400
No, I don't, actually.

00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:41.920
When do we leave?

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:47.680
We? Okay, uh, darling,
um, I was told to bring one witch.

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:50.040
And Mercury is not the sort of person

00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:52.720
you want to surprise
with unannounced guests.

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:56.320
I don't care
what kind of person Mercury is. Darling.

00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:58.600
I'm not leaving.

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:02.520
Now, you can either stand there
in your knickers and get in a huff,

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:06.680
or you can let Mercury know to expect me.

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:18.360
Well, I'd better put some trousers on
then, hadn't I?

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:22.160
You don't speak very much.

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:25.160
That is going to work well for us.

00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:28.840
The bathroom is that way.

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:29.920
There.

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:31.680
There, there.

00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:34.800
Hup, hup, hup, hup!

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:47.280
You don't have to do this
if you don't want.

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:49.480
No, I'm... I'm coming.

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:51.960
We're going together.

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:07.720
Throw out your clothes,
so I can get them clean.

00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:11.560
Come on. We don't have all night.

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:34.800
Uh...

00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:50.480
- Do you wanna...
- Uh, you can go first.

00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:07.240
Please don't fuck
in my bathroom.

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:09.960
I really don't like him.

00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:12.880
Yeah, really.

00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:16.600
So, what's your power then?
Cooking?

00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:18.600
Cooking, ha.

00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:21.440
Well, that's one way of looking at it,
I suppose.

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:22.880
An ignorant way.

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:26.080
No, I'm not a chef. I'm an alchemist.

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:28.240
Right, so you make potions.

00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:31.560
Any bog witch
can make potions, dear.

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:34.800
My powers are
a little more complex than that.

00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:39.400
Yeah, yeah,
I'm sure they're really complex.

00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:46.240
- Expecting anyone?
- No.

00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:51.920
You know, in all of the excitement
of hosting, I forgot to ask.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.280
Who are you running from?

00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:58.560
Fairborn Council.

00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:02.800
Oh, just the Fairborn Council.

00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:06.320
I tell you what. Why don't we skip dinner
and get right on our way?

00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:07.600
Yeah, good idea.

00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:09.600
Is there a back entrance
to this place?

00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:12.720
Yeah, in a manner of speaking.
Where are they? Where are they?

00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:15.216
- You looking for bullets?
- No, I'm looking for the...

00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:20.640
Everybody stay where you are.

00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:55.720
Wow.

00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:58.680
- Your training really was going well.
- Told you.

00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:00.120
Okay, I got them.

00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:02.560
- What are these?
- Bite down on it when you jump out.

00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:03.680
- Jump where?
- The window.

00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:04.760
The window?

00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:07.696
If you're going to repeat everything,
this is going to be a long evening.

00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:10.136
- Well, where's mine?
- Oh, darling, I'm sorry. I only have two.

00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:11.280
No, she comes with us.

00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:13.600
If only it were possible,
but I'm simply out of orbs.

00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:14.840
Fine. Then I stay.

00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:20.360
Lay down your weapons!

00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:22.120
And lie down on the floor!

00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:25.600
Can you
believe these motherfuckers?

00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:29.200
First, they destroy my apartment,
and now they want me to lay in the dirt.

00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:34.080
Hey, there is shit on the floor, asshole.
Why don't you lie down?

00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:36.840
Send out my daughter unharmed

00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:39.240
and you'll be dealt with mercifully.

00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:44.120
- Did he say daughter?
- Yeah.

00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:45.320
- Get out.
- Wait.

00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:47.680
Now. You need to get the fuck out, now.
Give me my orb.

00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:49.616
- She's not giving you the orb.
- Give me my orb.

00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:52.360
You have ten seconds to comply!

00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:53.440
Ten...

00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:55.040
- Give me my orb.
- Nine.

00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:57.400
Eight, seven...

00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:58.600
- Shit.
- Six.

00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:00.880
- Five, four.
- This is unbelievable.

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:02.800
Three, two, one.

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:08.160
Annalise.

00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:15.280
Annalise!

00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:22.360
Stay right where you are.

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:39.400
Annalise. Annalise. No!
