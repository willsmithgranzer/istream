WEBVTT

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.880
It's called a Witch's Bottle.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.760
I've read about them.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.720
Well, now you've seen one.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.320
Who did that to you?

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.360
He wouldn't.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.560
Nathan.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.920
How are you?

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.600
I'm okay.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.560
Gabriel said for you
to drink this when you woke up.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.080
Thanks.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.800
Odette.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.800
I'm sorry about your family.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.600
Not as sorry as the Fairborns will be.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.600
It's her Giving Day.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.040
Ceelia said that she thinks

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.840
she saw her brother
and her grandfather being captured.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.000
If Max gets his blood,
they'll both be fine.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.400
You think the Hunters
are gonna let them do the ceremony?

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.000
Ceelia said they would.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.520
She better be right.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.240
Look what they did to me.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.560
I'm so sorry, Nathan.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.120
It's okay.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.480
It's like you're always telling me.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.320
You're not your dad.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.720
They left from here.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.680
Follow the river.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.000
Teemu, find my daughter.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.080
Yes, sir.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.560
The famous Ozanne Blood Witches
wiped out in less than a minute.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.040
There'll be more of them.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.080
Did you know?

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.240
About your daughter's power?

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.560
- Is Ceelia still missing?
- Yeah, we can't find her.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.360
You! Where's my little sister?
She's only nine years old.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.440
I promise
we'll do everything we can to find her.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.960
We need to make camp.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.480
We can't stop here.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.680
It's Blood Witch territory every direction
for a hundred miles.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.000
Find me somewhere secure,
less than a day's drive.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.360
I wanna be there by sunup.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.280
- What about Nathan?
- I have what I need from him.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.400
So then what are we doing here exactly?

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.840
If we're not trying to find the boy
or your daughter,

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.080
what's the mission?

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.320
Our mission is to kill Marcus Edge.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.800
Do you have a problem with that?

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.600
We're looking for a boy.
He's traveling with a girl and a man.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.200
Nathan.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.280
You saw him?

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.960
He was with us
when the Fairborns attacked.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.520
We have to find him.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.080
Why?

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.160
Because you don't know
how dangerous he is.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.560
- Let's go.
<i>- Allez.</i>

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.360
Uh, Nathan. How is he?

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.840
- What?
- You should talk to him.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:30.760
Hmm.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.040
And you, how are you feeling?

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.520
I don't think
my brother has his blood yet,

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.120
if that's what you're asking.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.400
That's what I'm asking.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.400
You all right?

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.400
- How are you?
- Good.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.600
Good.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.080
I thought I'd come over
and let you know I'm okay.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.040
Yep, I can see that.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.760
I guess I thought you'd be happier.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:19.960
I'm ecstatic.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.360
- Don't touch that.
- What's your problem, man?

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.560
I thought you were going to die!

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.720
I thought you were going to die.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.080
Yeah, well, I didn't.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:39.840
No.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.520
Odette's brother can drink the blood
for both of them.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.080
Yeah, it's a twin thing.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.120

What are we doing here?

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.400
The hell if I know.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.720
<i>Bjorn, deal with them.</i>

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.560
Game up!

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.600
Here, I got you two. Look out!

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.760
Hello...

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.840
Set up a perimeter.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.040
How long we gonna stay here?

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.840
- As long as we have to.
- Whoa, whoa!

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.920
What's this got to do with Marcus Edge?

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.880
While we're here,

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.720
Jessica is my second-in-command.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.400
You answer to her.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.480
What?

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.560
You're a good soldier, Bjorn.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.320
Remember that when I give you an order.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:07.800
I need a few hours.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.560
Well, you heard him.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.560
Set up a perimeter.

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.640
We've been running for miles.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.816
- We're not gonna find them.
- You wanna tell Soul that?

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:34.960
Wait!

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.960
How far down do...

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.600
One of them?

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.080
Yes.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:20.480
Good.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:22.760
Let's go.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.200
Why are we here?

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.040
Where's my grandfather?

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.160
Where do you think you're going?

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:44.920
I need to see him.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.960
He doesn't wanna be disturbed.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.040
The kid prisoner turned 17 last night.
Didn't get his blood.

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:53.760
His granddad can do it.

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.480
You know, I always wondered
if those stories were true.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.000
About what happens to them
if they don't complete the ceremony.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.440
That's not what we do.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:10.000
Kieran's by the jetty.
Tell him to take the old man to the boy.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.960
There's gonna be an inquiry into this,
you know.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.560
You disappoint me.

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:22.880
I thought you were a Hunter.

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:26.920
So did I.

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.760
You should stick closer
to the camp. It's not safe out here.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.640
Can't stop thinking about it.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.880
You've been in fights before.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.360
That wasn't a fight.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.360
Go take the old man to his grandson.
It's his Giving Day.

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.360
Do that for them.

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.280
Tip the scales the other way a bit.

00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.280
Yeah.

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.320
Are you okay?

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.760
I'm fine.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.160
Take this blood and become whole.

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.600
Let me be alone with him. Please.

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:04.520
Okay.

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:32.920
There must be a way out.

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:36.280
There isn't.

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.720
We need to find Odette.

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.440
Do you think she's taken them
to Mercury's?

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.200
Mercury's?

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:48.400
I don't know.

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.840
When will my power come in properly?

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.200
Let's wait.

00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:00.360
It should be any minute now. Very soon.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.720
- Are you cold?
- Mm.

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.920
Is it... is it happening?
Did your brother get his blood?

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:30.840
I don't know.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:35.800
Come here.

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.560
Don't touch me.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:45.640
She's burning up.

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.240
Nathan, bring me my coat, would you?

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.400
Nathan, get my coat right now.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.320
Okay.

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:00.560
Keep hold of her, all right?

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.200
So, it's true.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.520
Get Ceelia!

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:30.120
Whatever happens, don't let go. Nathan!

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.400
They'll give them their blood, will they?

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.480
You're gonna watch this.

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.240
It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:10.240
I know. I know. I know. I know.

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.640
- What does it do?
- Makes it easier.

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:42.200
You're okay now.

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:44.080
Let it all go.

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.120
You missed it.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.760
Fuck off!

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:37.120
Shit!

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:42.520
Stop.

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.680
- Nathan. Nathan, please!
- Calm down!

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:47.920
Fucking Fairborn scum!

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:04.520
Get back in the cabin.

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.600
We'll hand you over
to the next Blood clan we meet.

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:09.640
- You know what they'll do to me.
- There have to be consequences.

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:47.680
Jessica!

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:57.720
Once I drink this,

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:00.320
I'm gonna change.

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:05.440
I... I might say things

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:07.920
or do things.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.080
I might bite down on my tongue...

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.120
and I need you to stay with me.

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:17.800
It's okay. I'm here.

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:28.640
Nathan.

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:33.880
Would you have pulled the trigger? Nathan!

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.400
She massacred the Ozannes.

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.400
- No, she didn't.
- Well, she was there.

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.120
We were there when the Ozannes crushed...

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.320
You wouldn't understand!

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.040
Yeah, no, you're right.

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.040
What would I understand about any of this?

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:53.760
What would I know about having a father
who'd done terrible things?

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:57.440
Or being on the run.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.480
Or almost being killed.

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:04.160
Or having my entire life
thrown up in the air.

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.800
Totally out of my frame of reference.

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:10.800
Or maybe...

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:13.560
maybe I'm just Fairborn scum.

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:26.080
Annalise, wait.
Don't... Don't be like that.

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:34.400
Nathan?

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.240
Nathan! Nathan!

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:38.880
Nathan, can you hear me?

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:40.800
Help!

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:56.920
<i>You know who I am.</i>

00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:59.640
<i>Everyone knows who you are.</i>

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:04.040
<i>I was told you was
an honorable man, Soul O'Brien.</i>

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:05.600
<i>Are you honorable?</i>

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:06.880
<i>I am.</i>

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:09.960
<i>You tell your council
we're ready to discuss peace.</i>

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:13.200
And maybe all this killing ends with us.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:16.800
Tell them Marcus Edge guarantees it.

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.720
- He's offering peace.
<i>- </i>Peace.

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:21.760
He's offering peace.

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.960
<i>You believe
they are willing to talk?</i>

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:26.680
<i>- I do.
- Then let's talk.</i>

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:30.920
Tell the Bloods they have their meeting.
At Wolfhagen.

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.960
We are here to discuss a peaceful accord.

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:44.000
These are our terms.

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:46.880
All Blood Witches
must abide by Fairborn law.

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:48.800
All Blood Witches...

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:51.080
I must stop you there,
Council Leader.

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:54.680
You see, I haven't just come here
to represent the clans.

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:58.040
I came here representing every Blood Witch

00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:00.920
that's lost their lives
to the so-called Fairborn Council,

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.560
every Blood Witch
whose children have been murdered.

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:08.160
I've come here seeking recompense
for the lives you've taken

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.880
and the powers you've stolen.

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:23.680
Come. This way.

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:36.280
Uh-oh.

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:42.880
My mom and dad are in there.

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.520
What's your name?

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:46.600
Ceelia.

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:50.480
It's okay, Ceelia.

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:52.280
He can't get us here.

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:11.800
<i>It's been ten years
since the massacre.</i>

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:14.960
If the stories are true,
the woman carries his child.

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:17.920
The council have agreed
she must be punished.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.800
It falls on the two of you
to carry it out.

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.640
<i>What about the boy?</i>

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:26.480
<i>- The boy isn't to be harmed.
- He may pose the same risk.</i>

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:29.520
<i>I believe
he may yet have a part to play.</i>

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:33.920
<i>- How should we do it?
- It must appear self-inflicted.</i>

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:34.840
No.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.200
Aoife. Quickly.

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:44.320
You leave us no choice.

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.320
You leave us no choice.

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:52.640
No! No! No!

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.720
What do we do? It's killing him.

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:56.920
- You have to take the poison out.
- How?

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000
Use your power.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:02.000
I can't use my power.
My power kills people.

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:05.800
No, I saw you take apart a gun
from his hand.

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:08.000
I wasn't thinking then. It just happened.

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:10.560
Annalise, look at me.

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:13.960
This. This is your power.

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:15.840
This is your gift.

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:20.440
It's yours to wield,
not to hide from, okay?

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.120
Close your eyes.

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.120
I'll hurt him.

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.200
You won't.

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.800
Come on.
You can do it, Annalise.

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:55.800
Feel for it.

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:58.680
Keep going. You're doing it.

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:00.400
You're doing it.

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:12.960
<i>Nathan.</i>

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:15.840
Nathan!

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:22.040
<i>Nathan!</i>

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:02.960
What did you see, Nathan?

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.240
Saw things he'd seen.

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:13.040
His memories.

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:18.000
Like we were connected.

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:22.600
I saw you.

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:30.400
Wolfhagen.

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:37.000
- I heard the stories, but I never...
- Hmm.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000
I never realized...

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:41.120
What else?

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:47.280
My mom.

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:54.680
They poisoned her.

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:57.880
They killed her 'cause of me.

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:03.160
They killed her
because of hatred.

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:08.080
They killed her because of revenge

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:13.160
and anger and... and hurt and politics.

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:17.720
They killed her because
of a war that has been going on so long

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:21.720
that anyone who was there when it started
is bones in the fucking ground.

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:29.720
Killed her because they're sons of bitches

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:31.880
and fucking cowards.

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:36.000
You know this, Nathan.

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:40.160
You know it's not your fault.

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:44.720
So, what do I do?

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:55.480
How are you sleeping at night?

00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:59.240
Badly.

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:01.520
Do you ever have violent dreams?

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:03.600
Yes.

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:05.640
Do you find yourself
getting quick to anger?

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:06.560
Yes.

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:09.240
Do you find yourself having
negative feelings about other witches?

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.120
Yes.

00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:13.320
Do you ever have fantasies
about hurting people?

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:14.520
Yeah.

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:18.040
If you listen carefully,
can you hear my heartbeat?

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:25.560
Yes.

00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:29.120
'Cause you're a Blood Witch.

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.680
You already know what you're gonna do.

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:37.720
There have to be consequences.

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:53.400
How do you feel?

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:09.360
I can hear heartbeats.

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:17.040
Lots of them. Outside.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.840
Soul, I'm relieving you of your command.

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:29.240
You and her both.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000
Bjorn.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.760
You've been a loyal soldier.

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:40.720
Don't throw it away now
when we're so close to victory.

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:43.640
If this is what victory looks like,
I don't want it.

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:47.040
- You're a traitor to your kind.
- Watch yourself, girl.

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:49.240
What about the rest of you?

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:56.520
Come on.

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:02.320
You.

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:06.080
Do you stand with the Bloods?

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:07.320
I side with Bjorn.

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:08.400
And me.

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.720
- Many of them do.
- Do they?

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.000
Maeve?

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:18.920
- I side with...
- Soul.

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:25.280
Kieran?

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:02.960
What happened, Teemu?

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:07.880
They're coming.

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:10.800
The Bloods are coming.

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:12.760
Get this man inside.

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:15.880
The rest of you get these traitors
in chains, then get ready.

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:18.880
There's a fight to be won.

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:20.320
Yes, sir.

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.600
If I don't get my blood,

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:38.320
will you promise
you'll do the same for me?

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:40.000
What you did for Odette?

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:45.000
Supposed to say, "Don't worry."

00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:46.800
- "You'll get your blood."
- Oh, sorry.

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.600
Uh, you want me to say it now?

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:53.880
No.

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:15.640
So, how do I go about getting my name
into your dumb book?

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:21.400
They're names of people
who are important to me.

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:22.800
What, I ain't important?

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:43.760
There. Now you won't forget me.

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:49.680
I wouldn't.

00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:59.080
I need a drink.

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:22.320
I'm not angry with you.

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:29.160
- What, you're disappointed?
- No, no, not at all, no, I...

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:33.120
I've always had
the utmost respect for you.

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:38.040
- Where are the others?
- Your co-conspirators?

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:43.720
Flo.

00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:56.880
Eric.

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:06.000
I've always been jealous of that one.

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:11.640
And what about dear Lennox?

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:22.000
Such wonderful gifts.

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:25.920
All given over for the greater good.

00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:30.360
What have you done?

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:40.800
What was necessary.

00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:11.520
To Odette.

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:14.960
And Max.
