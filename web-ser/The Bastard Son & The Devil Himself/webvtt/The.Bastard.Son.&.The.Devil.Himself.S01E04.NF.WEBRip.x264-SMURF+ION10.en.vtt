00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.880
<i>We must stay really quiet.</i>

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.400
It's time for your story to begin...

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.000
Are you ready, Gabriel?

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.720
This is what I thought
Paris would be like.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.440
Little bars. Cool music.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.040
This is what I was searching for.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.640
All of this.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.520
All of... you.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.320
There aren't boys and bars in Montana?

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.760
- I'm from Michigan, and...
- Oh.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.680
...not like this.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.640
Come back to my apartment tonight.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.240
And then don't leave. Stay.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.440
Stay, like move in?

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.960
I don't like it when you go.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.840
I don't like waking up on my own.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.560
I've been on this planet for 29 years,

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.520
and I've known you
for four months of that.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.880
So I've got some pretty solid data
to fall back on

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.680
when I say my life is not as good
when you're not around.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.800
So, come back to mine and don't leave.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.440
You just say whatever it is you want, huh?

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.680
I don't say what I want.
I say what I need.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.480
And if you can tell me
a better way to be happy,

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.440
I'm all ears.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:45.800
Okay.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.400
I'll get us some more drinks.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.360
Hello.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.040
Fuck!

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.960
Jesus Christ. Now?

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.440
She wants you.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.120
- How did you get in here?
- She gave me a key.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.000
I've had a long night, okay?

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.560
Can you just tell her
you couldn't find me?

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.160
Tell her yourself.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.600
I need some Night's Breath.
Do you have any?

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.000
Try dumping them
instead of wiping their memory for once.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.360
Hello, Gabriel.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.800
You haven't been checking in.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.320
I've been busy.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.240
I have a job for you in England.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.440
What kind of job?

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.960
Nothing dangerous, darling.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.480
Just meeting someone.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.240
Meeting who?

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.360
Hmm.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.680
What the fu...

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.120
Annalise?

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.160
Oh, God.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.480
What the fuck! Are you good?

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.840
Yeah.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:08.960
Okay, let's go.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.120
The Fairborn Council.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.320
No one said anything to me
about the Fairborn Council.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.240
I'm sorry.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.400
They certainly didn't say anything about
the daughter of a Fairborn Council Hunter.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.800
You need to go home
before you get me killed.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.040
Shit! Where's my lighter?

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.800
She's not going anywhere.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.920
Fine. Before we go any further though,

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.040
for the sake of trans-fucking-parency,

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.440
is there anything else
I should know about you?

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.720
- No more secrets.
- None.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.800
We're going to need supplies.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.600
As much vodka as I can get for that.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.360
Hmm.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.040
- What is your girlfriend doing?
- Um.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.280
We're not really...

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.120
Well, I... I mean,
I... I don't think we're...

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.200
Oh, please, for the love of God,
finish a sentence.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.720
We're not really boyfriend and girlfriend.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.280
I don't know what we are.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.840
Okay, that wasn't
worth the wait.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.200
And a lighter, please.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.760
There you go.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.320
It's a peace offering.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.480
An ugly plastic lighter
for almost getting me killed.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.440
- How incredibly generous.
- If you don't want it, don't have it.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.840
I didn't say I didn't want it.
I said I wasn't grateful.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.800
Come on.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.560
This is gonna be a long journey.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.280
Yeah.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.360
I may have lost my temper earlier.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.920
I apologize.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.200
There were several items of value
within that flat that I cherish dearly,

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.440
and now I shall miss.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.920
- It's okay. I'm sorry that...
- One gold cigarette lighter.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.320
One silk chiffon scarf.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:19.280
A selection of vintage
Russian pornographic novels.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.480
An embossed ebony walking cane.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.320
- One antique...
- We're sorry.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.480
Really.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:30.840
Gold.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Vintage.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.000
Gone.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.240
To Miss Adventure.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.200
That fickle bitch.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.440
May she help us on our way.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.160
Okay, what now?

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.240
We wait.

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.440
Are there a lot of Blood Witches
in Europe?

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Thousands.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.720
And the fains don't know?

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:25.040
You'll find that fains are incredibly good
at not seeing what they don't want to see.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.720
Didn't you have
anything brighter or slower?

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.360
Gabriel!

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:39.120
Welcome aboard!

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:41.760
Long time.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.760
Where is my goddamn money?

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.080
Oh!

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.120
You're very untrusting, Habir.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.040
It's an extremely unattractive quality.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.280
So is not paying your debts.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.000
Who are these two?

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.320
- Who are you?
- Well, I...

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.600
My name is Habir. This is my boat.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:10.480
Habir's a pirate.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.720
I'm Annalise. This is Nathan.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.080
Hey.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.560
Got anything to drink?

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.640
Nice.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.280

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:56.560
Take it.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.160
The more relaxed you are,

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.720
the less likely it is
you'll accidentally turn me into soup.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.040
A girl with blood in her hair

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.680
talks about changing her power.

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.160
One does make assumptions.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.480
It was an accident.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.840
- What did you do?
- She doesn't wanna talk about it.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.520
Oh, she didn't want to talk about
who her father was.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.680
She doesn't want
to talk about what her power is.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.320
But you want me to risk my life for you?

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.680
It's Decimation.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.640
The undoing.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.800
Not many Fairborns have a power like that.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:35.960
Lucky me.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.920
You just have to learn how to control it.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.520
I don't want to learn how to control it.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:47.720
I want it gone.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.040
It's the best I can do right now.

"That is the star

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.920
"But I still feel afraid,"
said the little boy.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.040
"That's okay," said the little girl.

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.680

I will squeeze your hand."

What happened?

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.160
We got the boy back
to the council building, but he escaped.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.520
- How?
<i>- </i>He had help.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.480
- From who?
- The Bloods.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.520
They killed a guard,
turned him inside out.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.480
Then they took Annalise.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.360
She's a hostage.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.080
So, we're going hunting.

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.080
Is that France?

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.000
Where the wild witches roam.

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.520
What do I do once I get my blood?

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.760
I'm not a life coach, kid.

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.800
I'm just here to get you from A to B.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:32.480
Look, let's just concentrate
on keeping you alive.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.080
Worry about the future when it gets here.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:36.200
If it gets here.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.320
That's the spirit.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.440
Safe travels!

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:13.880
Albie.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.360
Hi, Gabriel.

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.040
One adult, two children.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.120
Okay, this will cover the three of you.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.800
What's with the necklace?

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.840
Here, if you enter
another witch's territory,

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.560
you must acknowledge your presence
and pay your way.

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:32.800
Or else they might, uh,
you know, try and kill you.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:41.880
Et voilà.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:44.400
It's just fishing shit.

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.320
Okay, it's magic shit.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.840
Welcome to Paris.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:42.480
Come on.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:46.200
My apartment is just round here.

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.520
What, is that where the Cut is?

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.680
No, that's where a change of clothes is.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.160
Please remember we're on a tight schedule.

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:55.360
How could I forget?
You bring it up every five minutes.

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.240
This way.

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:14.160
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Fuck!

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.120
Aww, shit! Been robbed!

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:19.440
Oh, no, it's gone. It's fucking gone!

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.680
What's gone?

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.920
Something
that's very fucking precious.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:27.400
- You're having a bad few days, huh?
- You think?

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:32.160
Look, I'm really sorry
about all this, but we need to go.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:35.040
The Council could track us here.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.280
Or your father could track us here,
you mean.

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.960
No, we can't go until I've got my stuff.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.640
- We don't have time to help you.
- You're not listening to me.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.840
I can't make the next Cut
without my equipment.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:46.480
My equipment is gone.
You see where I'm going with this?

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:49.240
No equipment, no Mercury, no blood.

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:52.360
- How are we supposed to get it back?
- The door isn't damaged.

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:59.960
So, you know,
whoever got in had a key, maybe.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.560
Where's Ruby?

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.760
I don't know.
I haven't seen her for months.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.200
She robbed me.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.920
She took my equipment.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.560
No, it's not possible.
Ruby would never do that.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.760
She was a goddamn drug addict, okay?

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:43.200
She used to rob you.
I used to dare her to.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.040
It was a very funny game we played.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.520
Well, look who's back.

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:48.920
Nicky.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.440
Hmm. Sit down and have a drink.

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:52.720
Who are your friends?

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.560
They're cargo
for Mercury, from the UK.

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.600
They're Blood Witches.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.480
I didn't think
there were any Bloods left in the UK.

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:02.560
Two less now.

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:06.440
- Hugo!
- Hmm?

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:10.000
Pour some coffee.
We've got a victim of crime here.

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:14.440
Gabriel, I was beginning to think
I wouldn't see you again. What happened?

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:15.520
Ruby robbed me.

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.040
I always said I didn't trust her.

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:18.600
You literally never said that.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.840
He's a terrible judge of character.

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:22.520
This will warm you up.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.640
Oh, no. I'm okay.

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:31.480
To the friends at our table!

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.320
And our enemies in the dark.

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.440
And the ones we love who hunt them.

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.280
It's been crazy since you left.

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:38.776
What's going on?

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.160
Word came over
of some troubles from the UK.

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:44.520
- The Fairborns killed a load of Bloods.
- The Bloods killed a load of Fairborns.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.040
Which is good. Obviously.

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.160
Well, whoever started it,
it was a spark.

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:56.440
Now, we hear the Fairborn Council
puts their embassies on high alert.

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:57.560
All over Europe.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:18:59.800
Why?

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.080
They're looking for someone.

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:06.200
Aren't you worried that the fains
are gonna find out? Or the police?

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:09.720
Fains we can deal with, but the gendarmes.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.000
One in ten is a Fairborn anyway.

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:14.920
Why stay if it's so dangerous?

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.320
You think we should leave our home
because the Fairborns made it dangerous?

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.640
That's what led them
to drive us here in the first place.

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:24.680
I'm done running.

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:26.440
You might be a refugee.

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:27.880
I don't want to be.

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:31.080
That's all very noble,
but it doesn't help me get my shit back.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.000
Agh, if Ruby has stolen gear,

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:35.560
there's only one place
she's gonna take it.

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.240
- Oh, no, please God.
- Aha!

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.656
Don't make me go.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.840
I can't bear the smell.

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:42.800
The smell of what?

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.600
SPECIAL SHOP
MAGIC OBJECTS - BOUGHT AND SOLD

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:02.000
Ah, Gabriel.
I thought you were in London.

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:05.600
Yeah, I'm back.
Has Ruby been here?

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:07.200
Ruby? No.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.360
Monsieur and madam,
would you care to browse?

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:15.200
I sell everything
a pair of young witches could need.

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:19.200
Huh? Et voilà.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.520
A love potion.

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.960
Not that either of you would need it. No.

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.760
How about this?

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:30.160
- A lot of magic in a lost instrument.
- Oh!

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.480
Hey. Ruby.

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:34.360
- I have no idea. How about this?
- Please give me...

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:37.560
Bathe with this once a week.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:40.120
And your enemies
will suffer great misfortune.

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.160
Okay, okay.

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.760
She came to me about a month or so ago
with a box of stuff to sell.

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.120
She didn't say it was stolen.

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:51.600
- Where is it?
- One of my regulars bought it.

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:53.600
Who?

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.120
You really need it, huh?

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.640
Everything has a price. You know this.

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.280
I can give you
the daughter of a Fairborn Hunter.

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:06.360
The girl?

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.280
What am I gonna do
with a Fairborn Hunter's daughter?

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.640
- Sell her back to them.
- What, I'm a kidnapper now?

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:16.120
No one gets hurt.
She goes home, you get rich.

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.600
And I get what I want.

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:21.480
Wait here. Give me an hour.

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:24.960
I'll bring your stuff. No funny business.

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.640
No funny business?

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.080
- What's going on?
- We reached an arrangement.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:40.840
What do we do now then?

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:42.480
Wait patiently.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.200
I got you something.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:21:59.960
You mean you stole me something.

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:01.200
Yeah.

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:02.800
Thank you.

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.880
Never did get you
a birthday present.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:11.560
We'll get to Mercury,
then go anywhere you want.

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:14.240
Just the two of us.

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.640
Hey! Hey-o!

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.800
Do I need to throw
a bucket of water at you?

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.536
Now is not the time or place.

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:40.640
What, Paris?

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:44.000
Okay, it is the place,
but it's not the time.

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:45.520
Gabriel.

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.440
Where is it?

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.416
There's a book.
There's a little book that should be here.

00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.080
She never gave me a book.

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.000
- You sure?
- Yes.

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.040
We good?

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.496
Deal's off.
This isn't what I need.

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.560
You can't.
You promised me the girl.

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:08.800
What?

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:13.080
- Forget the girl, okay?
- Too late. I already cashed in.

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:15.800
- Run.
- What?

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.160
- Your friend sold you out.
- Run!

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:21.560
They went that way.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.040
Do you like that story, Gabriel?

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.800
Will you look after it for me?

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:40.480
In a minute, we're going to go outside.

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:45.880
I want you to stay very quiet
and very close to me.

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:50.040
But if I tell you to run,
then you do not stop.

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.440
Even if you see something awful.

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.480
Even if you see us in trouble.

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:56.680
Even if we call to you
and beg you to come back for us.

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:58.680
Do you understand, Gabriel?

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:02.280
You run and don't stop.

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:05.320
Yes.

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.280
Remember that you are very brave.

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:12.040
And that I love you very much.

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.040
We tested
that stuff you had on you.

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:20.600
Cocaine.

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:23.360
Amphetamines. Heroin.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.640
You're in a lot of trouble.

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:28.680
Blood Witch.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.560
So, I wasn't carrying any of that shit.

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:41.480
Maybe some amphetamines,
but I don't think so.

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:42.560
Hmm.

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:47.120
You're on our turf now, Gabriel.

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.440
Mercury can't help you here.

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.720
But you can help yourself.

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:56.840
We're looking
for your traveling companion.

00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:58.640
The daughter of a Fairborn Hunter?

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:00.720
Come on, I was bullshitting.

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:03.440
You think I'd really travel with...

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.600
If you tell me where he is,

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:12.640
it could make what comes next
less painful for you.

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.040
Huh?

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:26.280
Not the choice
I would have made.

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:45.080
Hey, look, it's the cargo.

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:47.760
Shouldn't you two be long gone?

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:53.520
What's he done this time?

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:07.840
Where's Nathan?

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:10.640
Where's Annalise?

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.200
I don't know.

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:17.240
Just our luck
to find the one loyal pirate.

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:19.840
I'm not loyal to anyone.

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:22.080
I just don't like you.

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:25.120
Thank you.

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:33.960
What do you know about Europe, Jessica?

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:37.640
It's dangerous.

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:41.080
Uh, yes, it's extremely dangerous.

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:44.240
And we're gonna be going
into the very heart of it.

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:47.880
We're gonna have to fight for survival.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.600
We're gonna have to be ruthless.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:55.840
We won't all make it back.

00:26:58.680 --> 00:26:59.960
But I think you will.

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:06.240
Because I think
you can be ruthless, Jessica,

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.680
just like the best of us.

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:16.760
Oh, fuck!

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:20.440
Find out where they are.

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:24.000
Don't let us down.

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:34.760
You don't have to do this.
You're just a child.

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:40.440
People always want to tell me what I am.

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:43.000
But the truth is...

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:49.240
I can be anything I want to be.

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.600
Interesting.

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:02.840
Jessica.

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:06.160
I remember when we found that girl.

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:08.720
Two years old and scared to death.

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:10.520
Well, she's not scared now.

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:16.400
No, she's not.

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:50.160
Paris.

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:53.920
Good girl.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.440
It's time to go.

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:13.800
Where?

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.360
Nowhere very nice, I'm afraid.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.000
Hi.

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:28.240
Hey.

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.520
We need him here.

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:34.320
We're taking him across town.

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:36.880
Not now you're not.
His lawyer's here.

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:40.960
Lawyer?

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:49.680
Ah, there he is.

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:52.920
What are the charges against him?

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:02.200
Assaulting a police officer.
Drug possession. Mm-hmm.

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:04.520
And what are the real charges?

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:09.920
You think we don't know what you're doing?

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.520
You think you're going to
take another one of us

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:15.760
to disappear in your cells? No.

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:17.400
Mnh-mnh.

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.200
Not today.

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:21.600
Do you have any idea
what you're getting involved in?

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:23.440
Who he's protecting?

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:27.600
None of you are going to leave here.

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:29.120
What's going on?

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:34.840
He's using his power!

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:43.640
Ah, hello, Gabriel.

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:45.256
I had this all under control, you know.

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:47.520
Of course you did.

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:55.240
Hey, Hugo, the keys.

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:09.080
I can't believe
I'm breaking witches out

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.360
for the second day in a row.

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:13.920
You wanna be careful.
You're gonna get yourself a reputation.

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:17.200
Oh, yeah,
what's that like, having a reputation?

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:20.880
Has its moments.

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:23.960
Shit.

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:26.800
- Go, go, go!
- Get in. Get in!

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:39.120
I passed my test,
like, a month ago,

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:40.720
and I'm already getting in car chases.

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:44.440
- Are they following us?
- Can't see anyone.

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:45.600
Take the next left.

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:02.560
- Thank you.
- We only did it because we needed you.

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.760
Can you take us to Mercury? Now.

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:06.000
I still need my stuff.

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:08.040
Oh, my God! It's gone.

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:09.440
No, it's not.

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.280
I was just looking
in the wrong place for it.

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.360
I'll be five minutes.

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:30.800
Fuck it. We're here.
We might as well get a drink.

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:09.920
Thank you.

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:14.080
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!
We're gonna keep that. Thank you.

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:18.600
- To the friends at our table.
- And our enemies in the dark.

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:19.920
To those that hunt them.

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:23.160
Ahem.

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:26.640
Uh, how long does it take him to make
the Cut once he's got his equipment?

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:29.920
Gabriel doesn't make the Cuts.
They were made long ago.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:30.840
What?

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:34.160
The doorway to Mercury is
at the bar we met you at earlier.

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:43.080
We could have gone through this morning
instead of running all over Paris?

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:47.240
Yeah. Why?
What did Gabriel tell you?

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:54.640
You stole from me.

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:00.520
You left me in a bar.

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:03.240
You ran away, and you left me.

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:07.520
And then you just... with no word.

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:08.720
Give it back.

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.720
'Cause I asked you to move in with me.

00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:12.600
Just say no.

00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:15.480
Just say, "No, Clark.
I don't want that. I'm not ready."

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:17.320
How hard is that?

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.880
How hard is it to not ask the question?

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:22.240
You knew that wasn't my scene.

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:25.600
You knew that, but you asked it anyway
because that's what you wanted.

00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:27.400
Oh, sorry, "needed."

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:31.200
You needed to cross my boundaries.
Well, fuck you. And give it back.

00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:50.800
I wish you worried about losing me
like you worry about losing that book.

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:53.960
Why did you take it?

00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:59.000
It was the only thing that
would make you come looking for me.

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:03.520
Added my name.

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:05.160
I don't know why I bothered.

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:07.400
One day, Gabriel,

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:09.960
you're gonna find the guts
to see something through to the end.

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.880
Wha... What are you doing?

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:32.440
Hi.

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:35.560
Sorry, can I help you?

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:39.120
No, I just got lost
looking for the bathroom.

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:41.120
They're down the hall.

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:43.520
Thank you.

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:46.720
Uh, no problem.

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:51.120
Hmm.

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:57.680
<i>- Blue Steel.</i> Didn't you think?
- I thought it was good.

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:03.600
Get what you needed?

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:07.280
Yeah, we can go.

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:11.720
What was it then, that was so valuable?

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.560
Oh, my God.

00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:18.640
A children's book.

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:20.320
It's a first edition.

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:23.120
- Fuck you.
- You lied to us about the Cut.

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:25.400
I bent the truth.

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:29.240
- What's so important about the book?
- Someone important gave it to me.

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:30.320
Who?

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:37.240
I don't know. Can't remember.

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:40.600
We could have been safe
with Mercury hours ago.

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:43.040
But instead,
we've wasted a whole day here.

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:46.200
We're running from the Fairborn Council,
from the Hunters,

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:49.440
from a murderous heart-eating psychopath.

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:53.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What murderous heart-eating psychopath?

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:01.280
You're the son of Marcus Edge.

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:05.040
Excuse me, you're fucking what?

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:14.880
I'm the son of Marcus Edge.

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:17.480
Oh, Jesus Christ.

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:21.200
And the Fairborns are after you because...

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:24.960
"His own blood will kill the wolf."

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.080
A prophecy.

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:31.280
I'm supposed to kill my father.

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:34.360
Well, that is just fucking great.

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:35.960
That is just...

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:39.680
What happened to no more secrets?

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:41.320
Hmm?

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:47.640
Marcus Edge?
I should never have taken this job.

00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:50.800
- It's fine by us if you want to leave.
- Oh, I ought to.

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:54.800
If you want,
we can take them through to Mercury.

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:56.840
We're going back to the bar anyway.

00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:58.320
Sounds good to me.

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:00.200
Take them if you want to risk it. I'm out.

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.800
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a life to get back to.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:05.680
I wish you all the best.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.520
Au revoir!

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.680
Don't worry about him.

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:12.920
Let's get you two
where you need to go, hmm?

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:17.240
Mwah!

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:18.400
Let's go.

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:21.400

How about a drink? Jacques, cognac.

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:51.360

Me? I didn't believe it.

The son of Marcus Edge.

Half Blood, half Fairborn.

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:14.440
Your father fights for us.

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:17.040
He unites us.

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:20.600
And one day, he will lead us.

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:23.200

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:25.560
Uh, I'm not looking to kill my father.

Well, what you're looking
to do doesn't come into it.

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:30.640
It's what you're destined for
that matters.

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:35.440
And what you're destined for
cannot come to pass.

They already went through the Cut.

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:52.080
Guess I was too late.

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:00.080

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:02.440
Nathan! Nathan! Nathan!

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:04.120
Nathan! Nathan!

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:07.320
Nathan! Nathan! Hey, hey, hey.

00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:09.440
Hey.

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:11.560
Are you okay? Yeah?

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:14.520
Come on. We have to get to the Cut.

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:21.960
- I'm sorry.
- Now!

00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:26.680
<i>♪ Love, now, here... ♪</i>

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:28.800
Apology not fucking accepted!

<i>♪ Now, here, now, here! ♪</i>

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:37.280
<i>♪ Now, here, now! ♪</i>

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:44.600
Okay. Okay.

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:48.280
Oh, my God.

00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:57.920
Ah, it's quite clear
you cannot manage without me.

00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:01.120
I leave you for five minutes.
Look what happens.

00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:04.720
Now I can never go back to that bar.
Which I loved.

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:06.800
Best jukebox in Paris.

00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:09.560
And now we'll have to take
the long way to Mercury's.

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:12.320
You're coming with us now?

00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:14.280
Well, the thing is,

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:16.960
I actually don't
get paid unless I deliver you myself.

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:19.960
We have five days.
Can you get us there in time?

00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:24.640
It's a long
and treacherous route, full of peril.

00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:27.800
Almost certainly ending up
with at least one of us dead.

00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:33.840
So, we're going to need
a very big bottle of vodka

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:35.000
and some comfortable socks.

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:39.160
- We should probably leave straightaway.
- Yeah, no shit.

00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:41.760
You shouldn't have lied to us.

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:44.280
And you should have told me
who you really were.

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:47.560
Why did you come back?

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:54.200
I thought I should see it through
to the end.

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:57.320
A decision I'm already regretting.

00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:01.240
Okay, let's go.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.000
You coming?

00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:20.320
Yeah.

00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:23.080
Yeah.
