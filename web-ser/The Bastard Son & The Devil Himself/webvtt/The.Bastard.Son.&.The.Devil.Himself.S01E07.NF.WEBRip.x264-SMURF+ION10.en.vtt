WEBVTT

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.120
Aoife.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.240
Soul, is everything okay?

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.000
<i>We've heard the Bloods are on the move.</i>

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.600
<i>Where are you?</i>

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.200
We're east of Ozanne territory.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.120
<i>And Marcus' boy?</i>

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
He's lost.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.160
For now.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.440
<i>How many of you are there?</i>

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.520
Eight left.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.040
<i>Eight Hunters won't last long out there.
The Bloods will come for you.</i>

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.440
The Bloods don't scare me.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.560
<i>Not anymore.</i>

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.600
Let them come.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.280
Let him come.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.000
I made it to Wolfhagen.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.320
We have numbers here,
weapons and supplies.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.920
We can help you.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.520
Yes.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.680
Let it end where it began.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.440
We'll draw that coward out,

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.920
and he can find out what it feels like
to die far from home.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.080
You don't think I'm powerful enough
to take him on.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.120
I think you will be.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.960
You're going to find him, aren't you?

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.160
I'm coming with you.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.640
It'll be dangerous.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.720
You shouldn't go on your own then.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.480
Are you okay?

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.760
Where's Bjorn and the others?

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.440
Tied up in one of the sheds.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.520
Are they alive?

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:05.960
Yes, of course.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.120
What about the prisoners?
That boy whose Giving Day it was.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.920
His grandfather was killed
trying to run away.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.320
I thought maybe if I used my power,
I could turn into him.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.080
Complete the ceremony somehow.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.040
It was worth a shot.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.200
I don't know
what we're doing here anymore.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.200
Soul has separate orders for you.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.280
He wants you to track Annalise.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.880
Bring her back.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.440
You can take one of the bikes.
Pick up the trail.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.320
We're going to Wolfhagen.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.760
Do you know where that is?

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.560
Bring Annalise there, quick as you can.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.680
Where's Annalise?

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.680
Annalise!

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.280
Annalise!

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.440
You're wasting your breath.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.720
She went with Ceelia.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.680
How do you know?

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.400
I saw them leave.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.640
And you didn't try and stop her?
You didn't wake me up?

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.040
I didn't wake you
because I knew you'd want to go after her.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.960
And?

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.360
And in two days, you turn 17,

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.400
and we have seen what happens
to Blood Witches

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.840
who do not complete
their Giving Ceremonies, have we not?

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.520
Look.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.200
She wanted to go. That's her business.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.480
My business is still here with you.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.720
Okay.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.720
Then let's get this done.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.680
<i>What are we gonna do
when we see my dad?</i>

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.360
<i>I'm gonna talk to him.</i>

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.240
<i>I'm gonna try and bring him back
to the Fairborn Council.</i>

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.680
<i>By force, if I have to.</i>

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.560
<i>Do you think
you can do that all on your own?</i>

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.360
<i>I'm not on my own, am I?</i>

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.640
I've got you.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.400
What's on your mind?

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.120
You're gonna think it's stupid.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.200
Try me.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.440
Okay.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.040
It just feels like

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.120
I'm losing something that,

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.160
I don't know,
might not even really be mine to lose.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.080
Like, I'm holding on to something

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.480
that might not even be a thing.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.640
- You're talking about Nathan.
- Yeah.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.720
We'll see him again.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.960
Well, you don't know that for sure.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:01.720
No, I don't.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.000
Well, I just always thought
in the end, it'd be me and him.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.720
This is so stupid, isn't it?

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.680
No.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.280
I was six foot by the age of 13.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:22.320
Bigger and stronger than all the kids
and most of the teachers too.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.240
I used to slouch down to talk to people,

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.840
skip lunch to avoid bulking up.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.280
And I was certain...

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.360
certain...

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.400
that I was gonna spend
the rest of my life alone.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.360
But there were men and women,

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.360
friends and lovers,

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.720
and with time...

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.360
I started to fit into my own skin.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:01.400
Thinking about the people
that you love isn't stupid.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.560
It isn't trivial. It isn't a distraction.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.040
It's the whole thing.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.480
It's the whole fucking point
of everything.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.440
Okay.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.480
Thanks.

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:46.280
I just can't believe she'd leave
without saying goodbye.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.200
She has her path, and you have yours.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.360
You both have to walk them.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.680
What are you,
fucking Yoda now or something?

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.920
Who?

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.760
Oh.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.720
Jesus Christ. Don't worry.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.280
I miss being on the boat.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.960
Less walking on the boat.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.680
Less complaining too.

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.440
Do you wanna hear
my <i>Lord of the Rings </i>theory?

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:11.960
Sure.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.400
Okay, so <i>Lord of the Rings</i>, right,

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:18.480
it's these movies about this little fella
who gets obsessed with a ring.

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:21.800
- Yeah, I know what <i>Lord of the Rings</i> is.
- You didn't know who Yoda was.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:22.880
Just tell me your theory.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.880
Like, well... well, the Fellowship, right?

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:26.800
Mm-hmm.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.360
All the hobbits and the elf
and the dwarf and everyone,

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.520
they go on this big quest,
and they get into mad fights with orcs,

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.720
and they're having battles,
adventures and shit, yeah?

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:35.920
Yeah.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.040
Well, the whole time
they're always saying, "Ahh!"

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.896
"Won't it be great when we finish
this journey, and everything's nice,"

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.240
"and there's no more orcs to fight?"

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:44.720
Right.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.160
But it seems like fighting orcs

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.800
and going on adventures
is what they like to do.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.480
Like, take away all that

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.920
and they're just no one, really.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.800
Like, they don't really
wanna throw away the ring,

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.440
because once they've done that,
they've all gotta go home.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.920
All the fun's over.
The happy ending ain't that happy.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.080
Frodo don't get to hang out
with his mates anymore.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.160
He's just sat around jerking off
in the shire

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.600
thinking about all the funny shit
Gimli used to do.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.040
You know, actually,
I'm not sure I have seen this film.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.880
I mean, you get my point, right?

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.600
Like, even if something seems bad
at the time,

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.600
maybe it wasn't.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.760
Maybe the bad times
were actually the good times.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.360
It's a good theory.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:50.880
The guard...

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:21.520
Shit.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.400
Their hearts have been taken.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.080
- Get Alice.
- Nicky.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.160
Get her.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:17.600
A necromancer.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:22.360
Open to rest,
my brother, bring us your spirit.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.600
Bring us your spirit,
my brother, and bring it quickly.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.240
Open to rest,
my brother, bring us your spirit.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:33.240
Bring us your spirit,
my brother, and bring it quickly.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.480
<i>What have you done?</i>

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.840
<i>What was necessary.</i>

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:47.960
Brother.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.680
What did you hear in the darkness?

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:57.040
Screaming, crying.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.320
Pain and fear.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.800
That was you, brother.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.480
What about after?

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.320
When the shadows came?

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.920
What did they say?

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.400
Wolfhagen.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:54.640
Is this it?

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:55.720
Yeah.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.720
Doesn't look like much.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.520
That's the point.

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.800
How does it work then?

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.400
Think of it like a train station.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.080
Just have to find our platform.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:10.880
Aw, now we're talking.

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.720
Mmm.

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.160
Where do you think
Annalise and Ceelia are?

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:23.880
No way of knowing.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:26.760
Just asking what you think.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.040
I think there's no way of knowing.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.440
You want one?

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:43.480
Gotta say though, I think...

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.320
Is this supposed to happen?

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.360
Yep.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.400
Jesus.

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.520
So we can go anywhere in the world?

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.720
If it has a Cut, yeah.

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.480
The number there matches the number here.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.960
Uh, there's Mercury, 11.

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.760
The tower we passed on the way in.

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.720
And look, here. The one for Paris.

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.040
Shall we go back to the bar
for a quick drink?

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.680
It's tempting.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.240
What's that?

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.840
Hey, Nathan. Don't go out there.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.440
I'm gonna take a look.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.960
We are trying to help you.

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.320
Nathan, wait!

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.000
He wasn't attacking me.

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:27.640
It's Jessica.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.200
She wants...

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.736
- She wants... She wants...
- What?

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.440
What? What? What is it?

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:37.720
She wants to hurt

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:39.600
Annalise.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:41.880
Don't...

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.920
Don't go...

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.760
Go.

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.000
"Don't go"? Don't go where?

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:55.560
Wolf.

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:01.920
I...

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.000
I... I, uh,

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:09.520
I just wanted to do something good.

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:21.360
No.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.600
No, no, no, no, no.

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:29.720
Stop. Stop. Stop it.

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.560
Stop it! It's done. Okay?

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.560
It's done.

00:17:58.520 --> 00:17:59.800
I killed him.

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.440
What was he trying to say?

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:08.680
He said Jessica wanted Annalise.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:15.320
He said, "Annalise, don't go wolf."

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.400
She's in trouble.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.640
Yeah, wolf.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:23.240
- Maybe he was talking about your father.
- No.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:26.560
He wasn't.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.320
He was. He was called Beef.

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.800
And he was
my brother's friend's... brother's?

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:39.880
Yeah, and they didn't want him anymore,

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:43.600
so I swapped him for an old iPhone 8,
because I was getting a new one.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:47.120
And my mom went absolutely mad

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.680
when I brought him home.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:52.160
Aw, I taught him how to stand
on his two legs and eat grapes.

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.560
I didn't even know that rats liked grapes.

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.480
And then you exploded him?

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:58.960
- Yeah.
- RIP Beef.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.920
RIP Beef.

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:06.040
- Uh, what are you doing?
- Get out of the car.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.960
Ceelia.

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.640
- Do you speak French?
- Not enough to carjack someone.

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.800
No!
What the hell are you doing?

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.600
I don't regret anything.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.640
Your car.

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:17.480
Let's go.

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.696
- That's stealing.
- Sorry. Sorry.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:20.560
What?

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:21.640
Go. <i>Pardon!</i>

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.080
We're sorry!

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.640
This is incredible what's happening!

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:30.480
Okay, I feel really guilty.

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:33.640
If that's the worst thing you end up
doing today, then count yourself lucky.

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:37.840
Here.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.480
Call your dad. Find out where he is.

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:46.520
I don't know if I can.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.120
Just keep it neutral.

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:52.520
Find out where he is.

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:16.920
We need to refuel.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.040
Make it quick.

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:22.120
Watch the road!

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.400
Fuel up. Five minutes.

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.040
<i>Dad, it's me.</i>

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.440
Annalise, where are you?
Are you... Are you okay?

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:41.800
<i>Yeah, I'm on the road.
We need to talk.</i>

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:43.760
<i>Where are you?</i>

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.480
Getting somewhere secure.
Is... Is Kieran with you?

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.960
Kieran, no. I'm with, uh...

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.560
I'm... by myself.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.680
I need you to get to me right now.
It's not safe out there.

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:02.440
<i>Yeah, I will. I'm coming.
Just tell me where you are.</i>

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:05.920
It's a Fairborn stronghold
called Wolfhagen.

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:08.400
- We'll be there by this evening.
<i>- Wolfhagen? What is...</i>

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:13.520
Let's go!

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:17.280
Let's go, move it. I said let's go.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:32.880
Ceelia told me
about this place. Wolfhagen.

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:36.640
It's where my father...
It's where the Peace Massacre happened.

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:39.240
She's walking into danger.
We have to go help her.

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:40.800
We don't have time, Nathan.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:43.800
- It's right there.
- We have one day, okay?

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.720
So we're going to go to Mercury.
We're going to get your blood,

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:50.160
and we're going to save your life,
and that's final.

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:54.760
What if it's not worth saving?

00:21:58.280 --> 00:21:59.320
It is to me.

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:19.280
Got it. Cheers.

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:25.960
Where's the Cut?

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:27.960
It's out there.

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:36.040
Fucking hell.

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:00.360
On three?

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
Hey, look at me.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:07.160
You can do this, okay?

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.760
Sometimes the bad times
are the good times.

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:12.840
Remember?

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:16.760
Yeah.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:45.840
I'm sorry.

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:55.880
You stupid idiot.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.480
Nice.

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.640
Please be right.

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.320
Oh, shit.

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.080
Oi!

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:18.320
Okay. All right.

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.680
We must be close now.

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:52.000
We'll be there by nightfall.

00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:58.720
What is it?

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:01.760
Two Fairborns. Close.

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:03.560
Go.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.496
When we get there,
will you let me speak to him first?

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.560
Before you, you know,
start punching people.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.160
I don't know.

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.280
I think he'll listen to me.

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:32.600
I reckon I can reason with him.
Whatever happens, I'm still his daughter.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:33.680
He's still my dad.

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:36.280
Oh, my God!

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:37.600
Oh, my God!

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:38.896
Come on!

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:40.240
Oh, my God!

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:43.000
- Oh, God!
- Oh, my God! Ceelia!

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:46.560
Annalise, drive! Go!

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:34.000
Fuck you, Robin Hood,
and your merry band of cunts.

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:18.080
No welcome party?

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:00.200
Speech is silver. Silence is golden.

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:01.400
Yeah.

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.480
In a house of gold,
the clocks are of lead.

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:55.320
Weren't you going to say hello?

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:02.720
So...

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:05.640
Where is he?

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:07.960
He didn't come.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.360
Oh, now, that is a shame.

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:14.200
He needs that. He'll die without it.

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:17.680
But I was very clear
he was to be brought to me.

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:20.480
Let me take it to him.

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.880
Oh, Gabriel.

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:28.000
You're smitten.

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.880
Where has he gone to?

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:35.760
Wolfhagen.

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:37.960
Wolfhagen?

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:41.800
Not sure that's a place
anybody wants to be right now.

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:44.480
Far as I understand it,

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:48.720
there's rather a lot of trouble brewing.

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:51.840
The fires have started burning.

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:58.680
And when those fires start burning,
they must be fed.

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:01.760
Lest they go out.

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:19.320
Where is everyone?

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.240
Maeve.

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:04.776
Hey!

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:22.080
<i>Please. Please. I didn't want to do it.</i>

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:24.960
<i>I... I said we should just punish her.
We were told.</i>

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:27.680
<i>We had no choice.</i>

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.400
Soul, maybe we sh...

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:33.280
<i>Get him here.</i>

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:35.880
<i>Just give me a minute, please.</i>

00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:40.400
<i>Aoife.</i>

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.880
<i>Soul, is everything okay?</i>

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:48.200
<i>We've heard the Bloods are on the move.
Where are you?</i>

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:52.480
<i>- We're east of Ozanne territory.
- And Marcus' boy?</i>

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:54.400
<i>He's lost. For now.</i>

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:57.040
<i>- How many of you are there?
- Eight left.</i>

00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:59.920
<i>Eight Hunters won't last long.
The Bloods will come for you.</i>

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.936
<i>Bloods don't scare me.</i>

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:04.680
<i>Not anymore. Let them come.</i>

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:07.640
- Enough. Enough!
<i>- Let him come.</i>

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:15.960
We should get out of here.

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:17.080
Silence!

00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:59.480
Such a shame.

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:01.720
He was so full of potential.

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.320
All lost now.

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:07.720
Give me the blood
and I can bring him back here.

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:14.240
Oh, my darling angel Gabriel.

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:18.880
So hard to say no to such perfection.

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:22.600
You must tell me.

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.120
Is it love?

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:38.520
No!

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:47.080
Wait.

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:50.640
Wait.

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:55.920
Oh, that. Um, that's nothing.
I'll take that for you.

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:07.960
What was I...

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.520
You were going to bed, my dove.

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:13.640
You've come such a long way.

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:17.040
And you're so very tired.

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:30.120
Gabriel.

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:34.920
I so miss you when you're gone.

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:38.920
Will you promise to stay awhile?

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:43.800
That's my beautiful boy.

00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:56.840
Hello, Nathan.

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:12.760
Dad.

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:17.040
Annalise.

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:21.080
What are you doing here?

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:26.080
- What do you mean? You told me to come.
- No!

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:30.160
No.

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:33.160
You shouldn't have come.

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:35.480
Dad?

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:42.280
He's here.

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:49.680
You shouldn't have come.
