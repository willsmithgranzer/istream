1
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,920
We came to you
because we had nowhere else to go.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,560
What can he do?

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,320
He can cook and clean.
He's a good boy.

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,600
What can he do?

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,480
We think he will be an alchemist.

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,816
- I already have an alchemist.
- He will be an exceptional witch.

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,160
Every mother thinks this of their child.

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,040
<i>How many of your clan
did the Fairborn kill?</i>

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,320
All but five.

10
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,920
And where will you go now?

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,360
We'll try to reach
our nearest family in Russia.

12
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,456
Perhaps if
he were an exceptional witch...

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,120
...he would know the ingredients needed
to ease his father's pain.

14
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,800
Gabriel, you know this.

15
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,840
Silver root. Oakwood.

16
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,080
Moss and stone and...

17
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,200
Lamb's blood.

18
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,320
Yes, that would do it.

19
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,160
Marie and Luc, I will take your boy

20
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,280
on the uncertain promise

21
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,480
he may develop
into something worth possessing.

22
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,760
Our business here is concluded.

23
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,000
No, I don't want you to go.

24
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,600
It is the only way, Gabriel.

25
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,720
Do not forget us. Ever.

26
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,920
No, Momma...

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,960
We will come back for you one day.

28
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,760
Remember that you are really brave.

29
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,800
My son, be strong.

30
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,640
Pap.

31
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,520
I want my mom and dad.

32
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,760
Dear Gabriel.

33
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,080
You have no mother and father.

34
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,520
Those were not your parents.

35
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,440
They were just two people
you used to know.

36
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,600
Just two more faces in the dark.

37
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,400
Sometimes you will dream of names

38
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,840
and not remember why they were important.

39
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,600
Write them down, Gabriel.

40
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,600
If only to remind yourself
that something was taken from you.

41
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,240
Yes.

42
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,440
Come, you have chores.

43
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,680
Hello, Nathan.

44
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,200
He's here.

45
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,240
His own blood
will kill the Wolf.

46
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,280
Oh, shut the fuck up.

47
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,760
"His own blood
will kill the Wolf"?

48
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,200
Fuck you. It's bollocks. All of it.

49
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,320
This whole time, he's been trying
to get revenge. That's all.

50
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,120
You wanna please him.

51
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,200
The Hunters are in that house,
so go and fight them.

52
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,320
Stop worrying about bullshit prophecies

53
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,040
and leave me the fuck alone.

54
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,680
Fuck.

55
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,880
Dad.

56
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,080
He's here, Soul.

57
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,760
You need her power.

58
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,920
Dad, don't listen to her.

59
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,080
Your Hunters can't stop him.
I can't stop him.

60
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,080
How are you gonna stop him?

61
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,360
Ice? He's got that. Fire? He's got that.

62
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,280
He's got every power you have,
except for hers.

63
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,000
She can't wield it, but you can.

64
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,280
He'll come in here,
and he'll tear you apart.

65
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,560
He'll do it slowly.

66
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,760
And then he'll take your daughter's power,

67
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,480
and there'll be no one left
who can stand in his way.

68
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,040
He'll wipe out our kind
until there's nothing left.

69
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,760
But you can save everyone.

70
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,480
Soul, look at me.

71
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,520
You can have everything.

72
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,120
You just have to be strong now.

73
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,680
Oh, my God, you are fucking insane.

74
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,040
Do you even hear yourself?

75
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,200
Dad.

76
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,040
Look at me.

77
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,800
Look at me.

78
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,320
It's not too late.

79
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,280
You can still do the right thing.

80
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,040
This is the only right thing!

81
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,320
You need to take her power.

82
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,120
No, I know you're a good person.
I know you don't wanna do this.

83
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,760
- You have to act now!
- Dad.

84
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,160
There is no time.
The Wolf is at the door, Soul!

85
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,840
I'm sorry.

86
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,960
Shit.

87
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,120
Bloods!

88
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,200
I'll get her.

89
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,040
Now you won't forget me.

90
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,720
Nathan.

91
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,040
Death to Fairborns!

92
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,800
I can't remember the fucking...

93
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,560
A journey of a thousand miles
begins with a simple step.

94
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,280
To dare is to do.

95
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,720
Cowards die many times
before their deaths.

96
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,680
She changed the password.

97
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,800
Go back to bed, you don't want her
to find you talking to me.

98
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,680
I'll go home to my mother

99
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,480
when the journey is done

100
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,960
and return to my home as the prodigal son.

101
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,600
Subtle.

102
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,200
You have no idea how important this is.

103
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,680
Thank you.

104
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,280
There's a shortcut
back to the water tower.

105
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,840
The boy before me made it to run away.

106
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,200
But he never used it.

107
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,040
Where?

108
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,880
Under my bed.

109
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,240
Why haven't you used it?

110
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,600
I'm afraid.

111
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,240
You won't always be.

112
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,920
I can't take you with me.

113
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,680
I know.

114
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,200
Will you believe me
when I say I'll come back for you?

115
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,320
I don't know.

116
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,560
I promise.

117
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,560
You're not leaving me, are you, Gabriel?

118
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,560
Yes.

119
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,280
But you promised you'd stay awhile.

120
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,360
I can't.

121
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,280
And where will you go to?

122
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,400
I'm going to help a boy kill a wolf.

123
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,200
This place has seen so much death.

124
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,720
The voices of the victims
are still in the walls.

125
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,480
Their blood is still in the ground.

126
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,600
Then let us hear them.

127
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,040
Split up. Find their leader.

128
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,640
Annalise.

129
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,640
Annalise.

130
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,560
<i>You know who I am?</i>

131
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,240
<i>It's over. Please.</i>

132
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,400
<i>Then let's talk.
Tell the Bloods they have their meeting.</i>

133
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,080
<i>Tell them to come to Wolfhagen.</i>

134
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,560
<i>Please.</i>

135
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:33,040
<i>I was told
you was an honorable man, Soul O'Brien.</i>

136
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,360
<i>Are you honorable?</i>

137
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,240
<i>We are here
to discuss a peaceful accord.</i>

138
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,200
<i>These are our terms.</i>

139
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
<i>All Blood Witches must cease
the practice of traditions</i>

140
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,680
<i>that contravene
the Assimilation Declaration.</i>

141
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,720
<i>All Blood Witches
must abide by Fairborn law.</i>

142
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,680
<i>All Blood Witches...</i>

143
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,040
<i>I must stop you there,
Council Leader.</i>

144
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,120
<i>You see,
I didn't come here representing the clan.</i>

145
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,960
<i>I came here representing my father.</i>

146
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,080
<i>My mother.</i>

147
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,120
<i>I came here representing
every Blood Witch that has lost their life</i>

148
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,680
<i>to the so-called Fairborn Council.</i>

149
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,280
<i>Every Blood Witch
whose land has been taken,</i>

150
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,200
<i>whose children have been murdered.</i>

151
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,160
<i>I came here seeking recompense
for the lives you've taken.</i>

152
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,040
<i>- And the powers you've stolen.
- </i>And the powers you've stolen.

153
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,040
Stop!

154
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,400
You are not supposed to be here.

155
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,520
Why aren't you with Annalise?

156
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,320
Why aren't you with Gabriel?

157
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,840
It was a good time to make a bad decision.

158
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,040
It's the worst time
to make a bad decision.

159
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,960
Well, I'm here now.

160
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,920
Did you get your blood?

161
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,960
I remember the first time I met you.

162
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,880
So tiny and little.

163
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,880
I picked you up.

164
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,520
And you looked up at me
with your big eyes.

165
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,400
And then you shit yourself.

166
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,720
We have to stop him.

167
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,600
I was supposed to protect you.

168
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,400
We can fight him together.

169
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,160
Go and find your friend.

170
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,280
<i>My mom and dad are in there.</i>

171
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,200
<i>What's your name, sweetheart?
What's your name?</i>

172
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,800
Ceelia.

173
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,880
Don't be scared.

174
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,680
I'll protect you.

175
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,120
I thought I was hiding
from a monster in there.

176
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,160
What happened to the man who hid with me?

177
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,400
I would have done anything for him.

178
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,480
A scared man
that couldn't defend himself.

179
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,120
Who had to listen
to his people being torn apart,

180
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,160
while he cowered in the dark
with a little girl.

181
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,800
There was honor in what you did.

182
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,280
Honor doesn't win wars.

183
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,680
What does?

184
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,320
Monsters.

185
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,320
That's what you learned in there?

186
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,440
Well, do you know what I learned?

187
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,880
I learned I'm not afraid of monsters.

188
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,720
Well, here we are.

189
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,640
Two witches in a cellar.

190
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,280
Playing a little game of hide-and-seek.

191
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,520
A little game
of let's cut out your fucking heart

192
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,200
and feed it to your dad.

193
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,520
Just another day
in the whirlwind life of Annalise O'Brien.

194
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,880
I thought maybe
I could come in here as Nathan.

195
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,640
But, nah. I don't need to hide who I am.

196
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,160
Because I don't think you've ever used
your power on someone willingly.

197
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,480
When you really need to use your power,

198
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,320
and, princess,
you really need to use your power now,

199
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,200
I don't think you have it in you.

200
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,880
So here I am. No tricks, just honesty.

201
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,880
And I'm honestly going to kill you,
Annalise.

202
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,440
Slice you open, take out your heart.

203
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,080
And feed it to your father.

204
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,320
The Bloods think that
when your powers are passed on,

205
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,880
a small part of you lives on
inside the person that takes them.

206
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,880
I like that idea.

207
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,560
I like the idea of you being stuck inside
your father for years and years,

208
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:57,560
just watching as he tears down
everything and everyone you love.

209
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,200
But then maybe I am...

210
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,160
What was it you called me?

211
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,440
"Fucking insane."

212
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,480
- You should have kept running.
- You should have let us go.

213
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,480
You can't control it.

214
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,280
I don't want to hurt you.

215
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,560
It's just you and me here.

216
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,880
You can tell the truth.

217
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,840
That guard at the Council,
the Hunter at the ranch.

218
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,600
Think what we could do.

219
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,920
Just leave now.

220
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,960
You're a Fairborn, Annalise.

221
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,480
We could kill those savages upstairs.

222
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,560
You could fill the air with their blood.

223
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,120
I bet you can feel it, can't you?

224
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,840
I bet you can feel them
coming apart at your fingertips.

225
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,680
You can't control your gift,
but Soul could.

226
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,760
Please go.

227
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,040
No one has to get hurt.

228
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,600
This isn't that kind of story.

229
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,120
Do it.

230
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,880
Annalise.

231
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,160
- What are you doing here?
- You pushed me off a water tower.

232
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,440
Did you get my blood?

233
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,480
Yes.

234
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,160
See, I knew it would be okay.

235
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,360
Why did you kiss me?

236
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,920
'Cause I didn't know it would be okay.

237
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,840
Drink it.

238
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,840
It's not dawn yet. Come on.
Annalise is here somewhere.

239
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,160
Get back!

240
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,800
Come on! This way!

241
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,560
Come on!

242
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,920
No, no, no, no.

243
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,240
Gabriel.

244
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,280
You okay?

245
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,880
You're okay.

246
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,480
Oh, no.

247
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,080
Oh, no. Nathan.

248
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,920
It's all right. It's all right.
It's all right. It's all right.

249
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,480
You didn't bring a spare one,
by any chance?

250
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,400
No.

251
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,280
Thought it was worth asking.

252
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,400
Come on.

253
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,560
You die today, Fairborn.

254
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,360
Listen.

255
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,080
No howling.

256
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,920
No snarling.

257
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,920
Your wolf is not coming to save you.

258
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Annalise.

259
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:27,920
Hey.

260
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,480
It's okay.

261
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,760
We're here. We're here.

262
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,920
All right?

263
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,920
- Where's Ceelia?
- It's okay.

264
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,160
His own blood will kill the Wolf.

265
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,600
Ceelia.

266
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,640
Ceelia. Hey. Hey!

267
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,800
Hey.

268
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,320
It's okay. It's okay. Just hold on.

269
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,360
Where is he?

270
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,360
Hunting.

271
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,200
Just hang on.

272
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,320
Please. Please.

273
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,200
To the friends at our table,

274
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,960
enemies in the dark...

275
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:51,320
and the ones we love who hunt them.

276
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,640
We need to go.

277
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,840
Go where?

278
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,440
To get your family blood.

279
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,960
Jessica.

280
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,480
Jessica!

281
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,360
Now what?

282
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,400
I'm all out of family members.

283
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,040
Oh, so you're just
going to sit down and die?

284
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,600
I can stand up and die
if it makes you feel better.

285
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,720
Your dad's still out there.

286
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,280
But you're not giving up.

287
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,600
We should think about
what we're gonna say.

288
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,360
What do you mean?

289
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:41,840
I mean, how many people get to know
when they're gonna die?

290
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,760
Most people probably go without saying
any of the things they wanna say.

291
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,080
So we should.

292
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,000
We all say the things we wanna say

293
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,320
to each other.

294
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,360
Okay, you go first.

295
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,440
You go first.

296
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,720
- You're the one on the countdown.
- Low blow.

297
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,280
Okay, I'll go first.

298
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,640
This has been...

299
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,360
fucking horrific.

300
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,400
But also...

301
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,616
...you know, kind of...

302
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,640
The bad times were the good times.

303
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,240
Yeah.

304
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,320
I mean, I don't know what's gonna happen

305
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:35,440
or how much time we have left together.

306
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,000
I will think about... Oh!

307
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,280
I will think about you
every day for the rest of my life.

308
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,440
I love you.

309
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,760
Both.

310
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,840
Oh, fuck.

311
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,880
Well, what do you wanna say?

312
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,760
Don't really know.

313
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,840
- Beautiful.
- Aw, come on.

314
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,080
Let me
get that sewn on a pillow.

315
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,160
"Nathan Byrne. I don't really know."

316
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,680
Okay, okay.

317
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,280
I love you both too, all right?

318
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,080
It'd be a shit time to die.

319
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,440
You know what we should do?

320
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,520
Have a quiet night in.

321
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,440
Yeah?

322
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,680
Just get, like, a takeaway or something.

323
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,520
- Make a nice change.
- Yeah.

324
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,560
No magic gunfights or nothing.

325
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,360
Maybe just watch a bit of telly.

326
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,960
What do you reckon?

327
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,320
I don't know where my dad is.

328
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,200
Fucked if I ever know where that guy is.

329
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,760
So, it's just you and me.

330
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,920
The Ozannes said you had
to kill someone from your own blood

331
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,640
to make the Witch's Bottle.

332
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,720
Who was it?

333
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,040
My brother.

334
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,160
Must play on your mind.

335
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,640
Maybe not.

336
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,760
You killed my mom.

337
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,040
You killed my gran.
I ain't forgotten that.

338
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,640
Now I'm gonna kill you.

339
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,440
And your father.

340
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:55,160
All your bloodline. Root and branch.

341
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,600
You gonna freeze me?

342
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,680
No, no.

343
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,920
You're gonna be awake for this.

344
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,520
All right.

345
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,680
I'll find you!

346
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,360
I'll find you!

347
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,960
Hello, Nathan.

348
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,440
If you're here to kill me,
just get it over with.

349
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,920
We don't need to talk first.

350
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,320
I don't need to kill you.
You're already dying.

351
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,480
Guess the prophecy isn't true then.

352
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,200
What, "His own blood will kill the Wolf?"

353
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,880
We'll see.

354
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,160
Soul...

355
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,400
He won't find us.

356
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,040
Not for the time being anyway.

357
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,960
You're not so scary up close.

358
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,200
I think that might be
a matter of perspective.

359
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,000
Why did you kill all those people?

360
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,760
Do you wish to avenge them?

361
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:31,000
Most people, when they know it's coming,

362
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,640
they behave in the same way.

363
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,040
They lose themselves to their fear.

364
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,480
I killed this man once.

365
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,600
A Fairborn Witch.

366
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,960
Part of a hunting party
sent to look for me.

367
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,240
When I came for him, he was calm.

368
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,240
Eyes closed like he knew something.

369
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,200
Man died with a smile on his face.

370
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,680
And I got his heart and found his power.

371
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,640
He knew how he was gonna die.

372
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,160
That was his power.

373
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,560
There are many that would swap
all the riches in the world for that.

374
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,840
If he knew how he was gonna die,
why didn't he try and avoid it?

375
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,840
He knew that we all have
our time on this earth

376
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,720
and our part to play.

377
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,920
That was Mom's husband.

378
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,440
Yes.

379
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,000
- So, I went to her.
- Why?

380
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,400
Because I couldn't
stop thinking about the look on his face.

381
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,720
How he died like a man
that had known life.

382
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,000
She was nothing but good.
Nothing but light.

383
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:59,040
And I met her,
and I loved her, and she loved me.

384
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,880
Can you believe that?

385
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,960
It was everything.

386
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,280
And then they found us.

387
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,240
And I ran thinking that
they would leave her alone,

388
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,600
thinking they would leave you alone.

389
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,680
Well, they fucking didn't, did they?

390
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,840
No. I was wrong.

391
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,080
So you have that gift now.

392
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,960
You know how you die.

393
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,800
Yes, I know how I die.

394
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,960
And?

395
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,880
And it's not today.

396
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,000
Is the prophecy true?

397
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,520
It's your birthday.

398
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,800
You need your gifts.

399
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,920
And your blood.

400
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,680
My first gift to you

401
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,400
is your life.

402
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,760
I'm allowing you to have it.

403
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,800
Though many think I shouldn't.

404
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,720
My second gift...

405
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,280
is the last thing your mother said to me.

406
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:02,840
She told me that she wasn't afraid
of who you'd become.

407
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,520
She wasn't concerned with
whether you'd be more her side

408
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,280
or my side
or what people would think of you.

409
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,080
She said, "I love him, Marcus."

410
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,760
"For the good and the bad,
I will love him like I love you."

411
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,520
"And I'll be here waiting
until you come back."

412
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,400
But you never came back.

413
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,800
No, I never did.

414
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,880
I need three gifts.

415
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,040
That man killed your mother.

416
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,840
And your grandmother.

417
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,080
So now he needs killing.

418
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,040
- He's too powerful.
- Yes, he's got power.

419
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,480
But his mind is weak.

420
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,600
He doesn't know who he really is.

421
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,160
So, my final gift to you is this.

422
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,960
The chance to see who you really are.

423
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,280
You got your blood.

424
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:37,960
Not all of it.

425
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,760
Where's your father?

426
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:44,880
Gone.

427
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:45,960
Gone?

428
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,160
Try not to take it personally.

429
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,800
I just don't think
you're that important to him.

430
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,000
He left his son here to die alone.

431
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:57,960
Let's find out.

432
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,160
His own blood will kill the Wolf!

433
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,320
Well, I have his blood in me.

434
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,920
You can't stop it.

435
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,280
It's my destiny!

436
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,600
Nathan.

437
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,160
They'll talk about you.

438
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,520
They'll know I put an end to it.

439
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:23,400
They'll know I had no choice.

440
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,560
No!

441
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:28,960
Nathan, run!

442
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,760
No!

443
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,360
Dad.

444
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,200
His own blood...

445
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:53,560
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

446
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,400
Who are you?

447
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:02,440
Someone who likes to help people.

448
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,800
I like to help people,
and you like to hurt people.

449
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,240
Can you fix my power?

450
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:16,960
No, dear.

451
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,760
But I can get you revenge...

452
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:26,120
<i>on the ones who broke it.</i>
