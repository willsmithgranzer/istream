1
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,760
What are you doing here?

2
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,160
I got here too late.

3
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,680
Uncle.

4
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,520
<i>Kieran, I'm afraid I have
some awful news about your father.</i>

5
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,120
I was thinking.

6
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,640
My left hand is still weak,
and I know I've been dropping it.

7
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,560
We should work on that.

8
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,360
Nathan, your grandmother is dead.

9
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,840
She took her own life.

10
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,640
So how...

11
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,000
She brewed a potion.

12
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,680
A Scarlet Kiss.

13
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,800
You heal quickly, Nathan Byrne.

14
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,040
Don't forget that.

15
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,720
<i>Nathan.</i>

16
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,760
You are not your father.

17
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,000
You're a good boy.

18
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,320
Blood...

19
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,880
<i>Fairborn...</i>

20
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,560
<i>Whatever.</i>

21
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,000
Reutger Sillwood is dead.

22
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,760
My brother is dead.

23
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,280
My colleague in the Fairborn Council,
along with her husband

24
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,120
and a whole squad
of Fairborn hunters are dead.

25
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,200
Your grandmother is dead.

26
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,560
I put these deaths
at the feet of your father.

27
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,816
Well, you've got me
training to kill him, so...

28
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,880
That was Reutger's plan. There's a new
plan now. You're coming back with us.

29
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,160
He's not ready.

30
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,960
- He doesn't need to be.
- I wanna stay here. I wanna keep training.

31
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,600
I wanna fight him.

32
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,800
- Soul.
- It's been decided, Ceelia.

33
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,880
- Clean up here and head back.
- Soul, who's in charge?

34
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,960
We're determining that.

35
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,920
You going to Gran's funeral?

36
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,000
Nah, probably too busy
with your new friends.

37
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,480
I don't know if I said this to any of you,

38
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,200
but I love the uniforms.

39
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,840
It's like Hitler Youth does paintball.

40
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,560
It's brilliant.

41
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,200
Was Boohoo doing a run on sports jackets?

42
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,600
Can you shut the fuck up?

43
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,800
What the fuck?

44
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,280
Oh, my fucking God.

45
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,080
Keep driving. Go past.

46
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,920
Keep going. Go past them.

47
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,960
Keep driving.

48
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,000
What the fuck! It's Marcus.

49
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,160
Drive! Drive!

50
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,000
Hurry.

51
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,720
Shit! Shit!

52
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,520
Shit.

53
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,360
Fuck. It's him.

54
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,680
Go past them. Go!

55
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,080
Keep going. Keep going round.

56
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,160
Go, go!

57
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,440
Holy fuck.

58
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,560
Get out. Get out!

59
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,720
Get out!

60
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:31,120
It's him. Stay alert!

61
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,480
Shoot on sight!

62
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,960
It's him. He was here. Your dad!

63
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,680
Fuck!

64
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,680
Shh! Keep quiet.

65
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,520
- That was my dad, wasn't it?
- Yes.

66
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,560
I just thought...

67
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,360
...maybe he'd...

68
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,480
What?

69
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,320
He'd come up and give you a hug,
tell you he missed you?

70
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,280
It's not that kind of story, Nathan.

What are we actually doing here?

86
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,520
You're not supposed
to be doing this, are you?

87
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,520
I'm not going any further
until you tell me...

88
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,280
God!

89
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,120
You hear heartbeats, don't you?

90
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,160
I can see it in you.

91
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,480
You're a heart eater.

92
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,200
A taker of powers.

93
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,520
I'm not my father.

94
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,720
You know,
I remember the first time I met him.

95
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,480
They say you shouldn't let
your power define you, but, uh,

96
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:54,120
it's hard not to feel slightly inadequate
when you stand next to a man

97
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,320
that can rip the magic
out of a witch's heart

98
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,040
and take it as his own.

99
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,960
And all you can do is
grow weeds out of the ground.

100
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,920
Maybe you should speak
to a therapist about that

101
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,640
after you untie me from this fucking bed.

102
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,920
Whose blood is that?

103
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,680
"His own blood will kill the wolf."

104
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,520
The coming dark and the waning light.

105
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,040
The promise of pain and endless night.

106
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,520
What does that mean?

107
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,600
It's a spell.

108
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,960
For what?

109
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,560
It's called a Witch's Bottle.

110
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,280
It's dark magic. Forbidden.

111
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,000
Why is it forbidden?

112
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,040
Because of the terrible things it does.

113
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,160
And the terrible things
you must do to cast it.

114
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,160
It's okay. It's okay.

115
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,520
It's okay.

116
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,960
There we go.

117
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,080
We're done for now.

118
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,240
Wait! Where are you going?

119
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,040
What happens now?

120
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,480
When it's ready,
I'll be back to finish the spell.

121
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,040
How do you finish the spell?

122
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,720
You'll see.

123
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,120
Yeah, the fuck I will.

124
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,720
Hey.

125
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,360
You stay where you are.

126
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,160
Stay there now. Don't move.

127
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,160
Don't do anything stupid.

128
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,800
I said, don't move.

129
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,360
Annalise.

130
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,840
Nathan?

131
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,280
Nathan! Nathan!

132
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,800
He's fucking lost it.

133
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,480
Nathan.

134
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,200
Have you heard anything about Nathan?

135
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,880
What?

136
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,120
I just assumed
you'd have people looking for him.

137
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,360
I think it's best
you forget about that boy, Annalise.

138
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,800
Darling, it's been months.

139
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,680
Maybe he doesn't want to be found.

140
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,680
- Hey.
- Hey.

141
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,760
You coming?

142
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,880
Revision club.
All the cool kids are gonna be there.

143
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,960
- Really?
- No.

144
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,800
Just us.

145
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,640
It'll take your mind off things.

146
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,000
<i>I'm looking for Nathan.</i>

147
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,600
Don't come back here.

148
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,280
Get on with your life.

149
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,200
How do you think you did?

150
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,160
I don't know. Okay.

151
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,760
- What about you?
- Smashed it.

152
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,720
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

153
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,200
Weren't you predicted to do super average?

154
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,920
- Predictions can be wrong.
- Oh, can they?

155
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,680
Yeah. Like I predicted at the start
of the year that you wouldn't kiss me.

156
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,480
And now I feel like you might.

157
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,600
Wow.

158
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,080
You're very cocky.

159
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,520
Do you like it?

160
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,200
Not usually.

161
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,960
So, am I right?

162
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,040
Would you kiss me,
or are you still pining for you-know-who?

163
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,680
"Pining"?

164
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,840
Yeah.

165
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,240
It's loud here.

166
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,400
Do you wanna go somewhere else?

167
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,400
Wait a second.
Over there. Come on.

00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,160
Come on.

173
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,400
Right, hang on.

174
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,160
Here we go. Push!

175

How are you feeling?

176
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,640
A little nervous.

There's nothing to it.

178
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,520
What do you think my power's gonna be?

179
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,360
A mother who can control water.
A father who can grow plants.

180
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,720
Maybe you'll make pond weed.

181
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,840
Ha ha.

182
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,040
Whatever it is,

183
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,320
I know you're gonna use it
to do great things.

184
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,520
Come on. Hurry up. Get ready.

185
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,320
Yeah, yeah.

186
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,600
On the day of your 17th birthday,

187
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,160
I give you your first gift.

188
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,240
Second gift. Your third gift.

189
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,240
This was my father's. Then it was mine.

190
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,560
Now it's yours.

191
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,840
Your family's blood runs through you.

192
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,600
Take of it and become whole.

193
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,480
<i>David!</i>

194
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,800
<i>What are you doing?</i>

195
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,440

196
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,920
Annalise.

197
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,240
We have guards now?

198
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,640
There's been another attack.
Several, actually.

199
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,560
Reutger Sillwood was killed.

200
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,440
Oh, my God.

201
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,560
You don't have to worry.
We're perfectly safe.

202
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,776
But if he can get to the head
of the Fairborn Council...

203
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,280
Hey, I promise.

204
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,360
I'm not gonna let anything bad happen.

205
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,640
You need to worry about getting
your strength back and nothing else.

206
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,240
Okay?

207
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,320
Come on. Let's get you cleaned up.

208
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,240
We're just next door if you need us.

209
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,240
I have to ask.

210
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,280
Have you felt any...

211
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,360
twinges?

212
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,440
"Twinges"?

213
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,920
Of your power.

214
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,800
Oh, um,

215
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,200
no.

216
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,400
No twinges.

217
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,400
Well, it will come.

218
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,640
When it's ready.

219
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,920
Good night, darling.

220
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,760
<i>Make it stop!</i>

221
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,560
Come on. Come on. Come on.

222
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,080
Grow!

223
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,240
Holy fucking shit.

224
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,920
- What have you spilled?
- Uh...

225
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,600
- A cup of tea.
- Annalise.

226
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,400
I'm sorry.

227
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,440
Why we put cream carpets
in your room, I'll never know.

228
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,840
Sorry, buddy.

229
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,720
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

230
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,600
<i>What do you think my power's gonna be?</i>

231

232
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,800
<i>I know you're gonna use it

233
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,080
- David.
- Mm-hmm.

234
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,000
- David!
- David!

235
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,880
Make it stop!

236
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,040
<i>Dr. McGarvey,
operating room nine, please.</i>

237
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,600
<i>Dr. McGarvey, operating room nine.</i>

238
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,760
<i>Annalise.</i>

239
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,960
David, what do you remember
from the accident?

240
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,320
Nothing.

241
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,920
- David, I...
- We were driving and then...

242
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,120
Yeah, and then
you put your hand on my leg.

243
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,800
- I wasn't trying...
- For fuck's sake...

244
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,640
- Asking what you remember from the crash.
- Pain.

245
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,320
I remember pain.

246
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,760
<i>Inside me. Like I was...</i>

247
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,120
Like I was...

248
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,800
Coming apart?

249
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,120
<i>- When did it stop?
- </i>When we crashed.

250
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,280
When I blacked out.

251
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,680
<i>I think it's best
you forget about that boy.</i>

252
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,800
<i>Maybe he doesn't want to be found.</i>

253
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,880
Annalise.

254
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,120
- What are you doing in here?
<i>- </i>Sorry.

255
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,480

Hey, Steve.

269
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,000
Hey, your dad's not here,
as far as I know.

270
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,960
Oh, that's okay. I actually
just wanted to come use the library.

00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,040
Well, strictly speaking, I shouldn't.

272
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,200
We're on something of a lockdown.

273
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,320
Oh.

274
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,440
I suppose half an hour won't hurt.

275
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,360
Go on. I presume you remember where it is.

276
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,880
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

277
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,920
Stay there now. Don't move.

278
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,160
Don't do anything stupid.
I said, don't move!

279
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,760
Annalise.

280
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,120
Stop!

281
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,040
Run.

282
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,400
Oh, God!

283
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,320
Shit.

284
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,680
That way. That way!

285
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,160
Fuck it!

286
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,520
Jesus fucking Christ.

287
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,080
I just killed someone.

288
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,160
- Annalise. Listen. Hey.
- Please.

289
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,960
Don't touch me.

290
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,800
I don't wanna hurt you.

291
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,440
You won't hurt me.

292
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,040
I'm a fucking monster.

293
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,440
You didn't mean to do it.

294
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,400
That's all that matters.

295
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,960
All right?

296
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,920
My dad told me you'd run away.

297
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,840
They had me training. Up north somewhere.

298
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,800
- Training for what?
- They wanted me to fight my father.

299
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,440
Are you joking?

300
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,200
- There was a prophecy.
- What?

301
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,120
That you would fight one of the
most powerful witches that's ever lived?

302
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,920
That's just about the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

303
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,760
Training was going quite well, actually.

304
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,400
Well, it would have to have been.

305
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,480
Well, anyway.

306
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,680
Plan changed.

307
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:15,960
What is it?

308
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,720
Your dad said it's a forbidden spell.

309
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,760
That's all I know.

310
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,760
What has he done?

311
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,560
It's your Giving Day in a week.
If you don't get your blood, you'll die.

312
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,680
What are we gonna do?

313
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,600
It's a map.

314
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,560
What?

315
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:45,520
A witch called Mercury spoke to me
just before the Fairborn Council took me.

316
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,040
She said if I ever needed help,
I just had to ask for it.

317
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,720
And this map would guide me to her.

318
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,840
Who's Mercury?

319
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,840
Don't really know.

320
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,520
- And what does she want with you?
- I don't know that either.

321
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,960
How does the map work?

322
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,320
- You don't know.
- No.

323
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:05,680
Just... Just ask for help
and the map will guide you.

324
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,200
Help.

325
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:25,400
Help! Help! Help! Help!

326
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,536
- Oi!
- Help.

327
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,960
If you're just gonna sit there,
shouting like idiots,

328
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,920
you can piss off outside.

329
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Sorry.

330
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,640
But there's no 186.

331
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,560
It should be here.

332
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,640
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

333
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:48,160
I've never met a... Blood Witch before.

334
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,440
What if they're...

335
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,480
What?

336
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,120
Like, what if they're...

337
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,080
You know.

338
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,760
Bad.

339
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,000
We're fucking bad.

340
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,560

345

Hi.

346
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,320
There was a map.

347
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,720
On my hand.

348
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,520
It led us here.

349
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,440
<i>♪ Give me all your money

352
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,760
Well, there it is.

353
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,880
I've been wondering
when you were going to show up.

354
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,960
Been expecting us?

355
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,240
Well, I've been expecting <i>him,</i>

356
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,800
which is to say, I was told
that a young witch would be

357
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,280
seeking me out
at a time of his own convenience.

358
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:07,400
No one said anything
about, um, whatever this is.

359
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,960
I'm Annalise.

360
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,560
Oh, good evening, Annalise.

361
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,960
I'm Gabriel.
I work for a witch called Mercury.

362
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,680
And Mercury has offered her assistance

363
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,280
to our gawping friend here.

364
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,400
He needs his family blood.

365
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,080
Well, she has samples
from all the witch families,

366
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,400
so shouldn't be a problem
getting you sorted.

367
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,840
Why does she have blood samples
from all the witch families?

368
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:36,000
Because, um, desperate witches
will pay handsomely for them.

369
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,480
Who is Mercury?

370
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:42,320
She's a witch who can get you things,
like a vial of blood, a rare gemstone...

371
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,200
All kind of powders.

372
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,280
And potions.

373
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,480
Can she change someone's power?

374
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:56,440
- Why do you ask?
- 'Cause I'm interested.

375
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,840
Is it related to the blood in your hair?

376
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,120
Anything is possible.

377
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,960
- Where is she?
- Far away.

378
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:11,040
First, we must get to Paris
and then travel on from there.

379
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,480
Paris, France?

380
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,640
Yes, dear. Paris, France.

381
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,360
Uh, now, I have a bathroom
and a single spare towel,

382
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,560
which you may both use,

383
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:25,600
so why don't you go and clean up
while I make preparations?

384
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,680
- Preparations?
- Yeah, for the journey.

385
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,320
- To Paris?
- Yes, to Paris.

386
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,480
Don't you wanna ask
why we're covered in blood?

387
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,400
No, I don't, actually.

388
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:41,920
When do we leave?

389
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:47,680
We? Okay, uh, darling,
um, I was told to bring one witch.

390
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,040
And Mercury is not the sort of person

391
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,720
you want to surprise
with unannounced guests.

392
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,320
I don't care
what kind of person Mercury is. Darling.

393
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,600
I'm not leaving.

394
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,520
Now, you can either stand there
in your knickers and get in a huff,

395
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,680
or you can let Mercury know to expect me.

396
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:18,360
Well, I'd better put some trousers on
then, hadn't I?

397
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,160
You don't speak very much.

398
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,160
That is going to work well for us.

399
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,840
The bathroom is that way.

400
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:29,920
There.

401
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,680
There, there.

402
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,800
Hup, hup, hup, hup!

403
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,280
You don't have to do this
if you don't want.

404
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,480
No, I'm... I'm coming.

405
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:51,960
We're going together.

406
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,720
Throw out your clothes,
so I can get them clean.

407
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,560
Come on. We don't have all night.

408
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:34,800
Uh...

409
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,480
- Do you wanna...
- Uh, you can go first.

410
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,240
Please don't fuck
in my bathroom.

411
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,960
I really don't like him.

412
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,880
Yeah, really.

413
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,600
So, what's your power then?
Cooking?

414
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,600
Cooking, ha.

415
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:21,440
Well, that's one way of looking at it,
I suppose.

416
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,880
An ignorant way.

417
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,080
No, I'm not a chef. I'm an alchemist.

418
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,240
Right, so you make potions.

419
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,560
Any bog witch
can make potions, dear.

420
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,800
My powers are
a little more complex than that.

421
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:39,400
Yeah, yeah,
I'm sure they're really complex.

422
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,240
- Expecting anyone?
- No.

423
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,920
You know, in all of the excitement
of hosting, I forgot to ask.

424
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,280
Who are you running from?

425
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,560
Fairborn Council.

426
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:02,800
Oh, just the Fairborn Council.

427
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,320
I tell you what. Why don't we skip dinner
and get right on our way?

428
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,600
Yeah, good idea.

429
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,600
Is there a back entrance
to this place?

430
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,720
Yeah, in a manner of speaking.
Where are they? Where are they?

431
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,216
- You looking for bullets?
- No, I'm looking for the...

432
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,640
Everybody stay where you are.

433
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,720
Wow.

434
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,680
- Your training really was going well.
- Told you.

435
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,120
Okay, I got them.

436
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,560
- What are these?
- Bite down on it when you jump out.

437
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,680
- Jump where?
- The window.

438
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:04,760
The window?

439
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,696
If you're going to repeat everything,
this is going to be a long evening.

440
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:10,136
- Well, where's mine?
- Oh, darling, I'm sorry. I only have two.

441
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,280
No, she comes with us.

442
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,600
If only it were possible,
but I'm simply out of orbs.

443
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:14,840
Fine. Then I stay.

444
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:20,360
Lay down your weapons!

445
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,120
And lie down on the floor!

446
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:25,600
Can you
believe these motherfuckers?

447
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,200
First, they destroy my apartment,
and now they want me to lay in the dirt.

448
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:34,080
Hey, there is shit on the floor, asshole.
Why don't you lie down?

449
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,840
Send out my daughter unharmed

450
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,240
and you'll be dealt with mercifully.

451
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:44,120
- Did he say daughter?
- Yeah.

452
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,320
- Get out.
- Wait.

453
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,680
Now. You need to get the fuck out, now.
Give me my orb.

454
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,616
- She's not giving you the orb.
- Give me my orb.

455
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:52,360
You have ten seconds to comply!

456
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:53,440
Ten...

457
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,040
- Give me my orb.
- Nine.

458
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,400
Eight, seven...

459
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,600
- Shit.
- Six.

460
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,880
- Five, four.
- This is unbelievable.

461
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,800
Three, two, one.

462
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,160
Annalise.

463
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:15,280
Annalise!

464
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,360
Stay right where you are.

465
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:39,400
Annalise. Annalise. No!
