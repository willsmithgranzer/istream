00:37.416 --> 00:38.416
In life,

00:39.166 --> 00:41.708
everyone is born to achieve something.

00:42.416 --> 00:46.541
But most of the people,
die without ever knowing it.

00:47.541 --> 00:51.333
I realized very early
why I was brought into this world.

00:52.250 --> 00:57.250
But, have I truly fulfilled
that purpose, or not…

00:58.083 --> 00:59.708
is the question that
haunts me to this day.

01:12.791 --> 01:13.625
Today,

01:13.958 --> 01:16.791
let's talk about our Indian legends.

01:19.958 --> 01:24.958
Today we talk about
the pride of our nation, Bhagat Singh.

01:28.625 --> 01:30.416
He was born for the people.

01:32.791 --> 01:34.083
Lived for the people.

01:35.750 --> 01:37.458
And died for the people.

01:48.083 --> 01:48.958
Ma'am.

01:49.458 --> 01:50.791
Your son fell from the building.

02:12.458 --> 02:14.208
How brave are these people!

02:14.958 --> 02:17.250
They challenge
the mightiest of the villains.

02:17.791 --> 02:21.583
Why do they need to be brave
if they have superpowers?

02:21.916 --> 02:23.916
They can fly in the sky,

02:24.291 --> 02:25.791
they can walk on fire,

02:26.583 --> 02:29.416
and they can swim in the depths
of the ocean.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.333
They don't get injured even if they fall

02:31.583 --> 02:33.083
and they're bulletproof.

02:34.291 --> 02:36.708
Mom, why can't I be a superhero?

02:38.041 --> 02:40.291
Why don't I have
superpowers like them?

02:42.541 --> 02:46.125
Look, superheroes like these

02:46.708 --> 02:50.000
are only found
in comic books and movies.

02:50.875 --> 02:54.458
Nobody has superpowers in real life.

02:55.666 --> 02:59.166
Do you mean to say that there
are no superheroes in the world?

02:59.250 --> 03:03.916
There are a many!
But with no superpowers.

03:05.208 --> 03:08.125
Superheroes without superpowers?

03:08.416 --> 03:09.458
Who are they?

03:10.208 --> 03:12.791
There are a lot of them in this world.

03:13.958 --> 03:19.916
The people who live only for others
and not for themselves are superheroes.

03:20.125 --> 03:21.958
It might be a soldier
who protects our nation.

03:22.791 --> 03:24.791
It might be a doctor who saves lives.

03:25.625 --> 03:27.375
They're all superheroes.

03:32.750 --> 03:33.625
Not only that,

03:34.333 --> 03:36.875
your dad, who wears
a police uniform is also a superhero.

03:41.250 --> 03:42.500
Is Dad a superhero?

03:42.958 --> 03:44.416
What will he do?

03:44.708 --> 03:46.083
He only catches thieves.

03:47.875 --> 03:52.583
He might not have the ability
to fly or wear bulletproof armor,

03:53.166 --> 03:56.666
but he won't care for his life,
or whether it's day or night,

03:57.291 --> 04:00.375
he faces the villains head-on.
He is the real police.

04:02.041 --> 04:04.041
He is the real superhero.

04:13.125 --> 04:14.500
If you have the same courage,

04:16.083 --> 04:17.541
you too are a superhero.

04:18.250 --> 04:19.875
I also have courage, Mom.

04:21.583 --> 04:23.875
I'll be a police officer like my dad.

04:24.833 --> 04:29.208
No matter how terrifying
or what kind of supervillain might come,

04:29.791 --> 04:32.333
I'll be the superhero who confronts him.

04:48.458 --> 04:51.333
A severe cyclone has intensified
in the Indian Ocean.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.958
Coastal areas…

04:53.041 --> 04:54.500
Have been issued a red alert.

04:54.583 --> 04:56.583
Fishermen have been advised

04:56.666 --> 04:58.791
by the Coastal Department
to avoid going into the sea

04:58.875 --> 04:59.875
-for the next three days.
-The sea is awful.

04:59.958 --> 05:01.208
Don't step into the sea.

05:05.958 --> 05:07.750
-I can't get through.
-Pull it fast!

05:09.166 --> 05:10.250
Tie it up!

05:11.375 --> 05:14.583
-Did you get any signal?
-No one is getting a signal.

05:21.208 --> 05:23.791
A huge wave is coming!
Hold tight!

05:24.250 --> 05:25.875
Hold tight!

05:26.291 --> 05:27.458
Look at the wave!

05:33.958 --> 05:35.583
A huge wave is coming.

05:59.500 --> 06:00.375
Hey!

06:00.583 --> 06:03.791
-Here!
-Hey!

06:03.916 --> 06:07.208
Save us! Save us!

06:21.916 --> 06:22.958
Oh, no!

06:24.000 --> 06:24.833
Drag them.

06:26.250 --> 06:27.916
Stop hitting us!

06:28.541 --> 06:30.041
Who are you guys? Oh, no!

06:30.500 --> 06:32.625
Please don't hurt us.
Let us go.

06:32.708 --> 06:34.250
Help! Oh, God!

06:34.916 --> 06:36.791
Who are you guys?
Guys, jump!

07:58.250 --> 07:59.291
Let us go!

07:59.375 --> 08:00.291
Please don't hit us!

08:01.791 --> 08:02.708
Oh no!

08:02.958 --> 08:04.958
Let us go, Boss!

08:05.041 --> 08:05.916
Don't!

08:06.000 --> 08:09.416
-No!
-Please don't hit us!

08:10.583 --> 08:12.875
Please don't hit us!

08:12.958 --> 08:15.125
Don't!

08:21.458 --> 08:26.000
When many people sing
a good song together,

08:26.791 --> 08:28.583
it often sounds horrible.

08:28.791 --> 08:30.500
However, when just one person sings it,

08:31.583 --> 08:33.625
it sounds melodious.

08:34.583 --> 08:36.416
Oh, God!

08:36.500 --> 08:39.583
Oh, God!

08:39.958 --> 08:42.708
Which God is coming to protect you?

08:43.750 --> 08:48.791
If that God tries to touch me,
I'll cut off his hand too.

08:56.166 --> 08:57.208
-I…
-I…

08:57.291 --> 08:58.375
Vedanth Prabhakar,

09:01.125 --> 09:02.750
-do swear…
-do swear…

09:04.000 --> 09:06.375

-and bear true allegiance to India.
-and bear true allegiance to India.

09:11.083 --> 09:14.666
-And to the Constitution of India.
-And to the Constitution of India.

09:14.833 --> 09:16.708
-As by law…
-As by law…

09:16.791 --> 09:18.541
-established.

09:18.625 --> 09:20.166
-I swear…

09:23.500 --> 09:25.500

09:44.291 --> 09:46.750
-and with impartiality.
-and with impartiality.

09:46.833 --> 09:48.583
Happy birthday, Vedanth.

09:48.833 --> 09:49.791
Thank you, Mom.

09:51.416 --> 09:52.291
What's this, Mom?

09:54.458 --> 09:56.541
Wow! It's a police uniform!

09:56.791 --> 09:58.583
Thank you, Mom. I'll wear it right now.

09:58.666 --> 10:00.041
Vedanth, wait.

10:03.125 --> 10:06.291
This isn't like just any other clothing.

10:07.291 --> 10:08.916
Before you wear it,

10:09.458 --> 10:10.666
take a bath,

10:11.375 --> 10:12.333
iron it,

10:12.916 --> 10:14.333
and with a lot of devotion,

10:14.791 --> 10:17.041
you have to wear
the uniform and the belt,

10:17.458 --> 10:18.750
and with a pure heart

10:19.750 --> 10:21.125
you have to pray
to God with good intentions.

10:36.500 --> 10:38.000
It's always me who gets
to do all the work.

10:38.083 --> 10:39.541
Go and check what's going on.

10:39.625 --> 10:41.083
Sir is coming.

10:41.625 --> 10:42.458
Brother.

10:42.916 --> 10:43.750
Fat.

10:43.916 --> 10:45.250
Did I get fat?

10:45.416 --> 10:48.958
You haven't become fat.
Your clothes have just shrunk, that's all.

10:49.791 --> 10:52.000
You never take any bribes,
how can you get fat?

10:53.416 --> 10:57.041
I meant you never eat fries,
how can you get fat?

10:57.416 --> 10:59.250
Govinda, you've become quite talkative!

10:59.416 --> 11:02.958
One of these days, you might get
"fried" by me, so be careful.

11:03.250 --> 11:04.083
And--

11:05.083 --> 11:07.041
Hey, our officer will be here
any minute now!

11:07.125 --> 11:08.083
Everyone, come soon!

11:08.166 --> 11:09.375
Everybody is just loafing around!

11:09.458 --> 11:10.875
-Come soon!
-Sir. Yes, sir.

11:13.958 --> 11:15.375
Hey! Get up!

11:16.250 --> 11:17.625
Our officer is coming! Start playing.

11:19.791 --> 11:22.333
I heard our officer is a gold medalist.
Is that right?

11:22.416 --> 11:25.333
Yes, he is. That's why he was assigned
to this golden police station.

11:25.708 --> 11:27.375
This station is his first posting.

11:27.458 --> 11:30.166
From now on,
our bribe collection will shoot up.

11:32.583 --> 11:35.208
Start the music! Burst the crackers!

11:46.166 --> 11:47.125
-Sir, welcome.
-Greetings, sir.

11:47.208 --> 11:48.125
-Hello, sir.
-These people are very close

11:48.208 --> 11:49.458
-to our department.
-Hi, sir.

11:49.625 --> 11:51.708
Sir, these are
the newly appointed police officers.

11:51.791 --> 11:54.125
-This is Inspector Vijayalakshmi.
-Hello, sir.

11:54.208 --> 11:55.625
-Inspector Prasad.
-Sir.

11:55.708 --> 11:57.583
-This is our Constable Govind.
-Sir.

11:57.750 --> 12:00.833
And this is Omkar,
a very senior Head Constable.

12:00.916 --> 12:02.458
He's been working
since your father's time.

12:02.541 --> 12:06.416
Omkar, do you know who this is?
Prabhakar sir's son. A gold medalist!

12:06.666 --> 12:08.083
Is he the son of our dear Prabhakar sir?!

12:08.208 --> 12:09.666
Prabhakar sir is a very good person.

12:09.750 --> 12:11.458
-He took great care of us.
-Thank you.

12:11.750 --> 12:15.458
We served under your father,
and now under you.

12:15.750 --> 12:17.166
It's a great pleasure.

12:17.250 --> 12:18.750
-Hey, Narayan.
-Sir?

12:18.833 --> 12:21.333
I heard there isn't much crime happening
in our jurisdiction. Is that right?

12:21.416 --> 12:23.833
Sir, there is nothing
to worry about in our jurisdiction.

12:23.916 --> 12:25.375
Look, all the cells are empty.

12:25.458 --> 12:27.333
We're very relaxed here, sir.

12:28.458 --> 12:31.166
I can see that.
You guys are very relaxed.

12:31.708 --> 12:33.625
Come, let's go patrol our area.

12:33.708 --> 12:35.458
Sir, why should you
take the trouble to patrol?

12:35.541 --> 12:37.333
Everything comes to your table anyway.

12:37.416 --> 12:39.041
Sir, schedule a proper meeting.

12:39.166 --> 12:41.041
All of them are small fishes.

12:41.125 --> 12:43.166
You don't need to go, sir.

12:44.416 --> 12:45.500
-Officers! Relax.
-Sir?

12:45.583 --> 12:46.458
Yes, sir.

12:46.750 --> 12:47.916
-Hey, Narayan.
-Sir?

12:48.000 --> 12:51.125
Isn't it unfair not to see the fish
and the sea when you're in Mangalore?

12:51.291 --> 12:52.125
Come, let's go.

12:52.208 --> 12:53.166
Right now, sir?

12:53.708 --> 12:56.083
Do you need to look for an auspicious time
just to patrol the area, Narayan?

12:56.333 --> 12:57.166
Come, let's go.

12:59.166 --> 13:02.041
A uniform is not required, right?

13:22.708 --> 13:24.083
-Hey, Narayan.
-Yes, sir.

13:24.458 --> 13:26.000
Are you sure there are
no wrongdoings happening here?

13:26.666 --> 13:28.500
Nothing at all, sir.
Everyone here is a fisherman.

13:29.625 --> 13:31.416
Occasionally, fish may
ingest things they shouldn't

13:31.708 --> 13:34.166
or unexpected items
can get tangled in the nets.

13:34.750 --> 13:36.750
-What can anyone do, sir?
-Oh! It's like that.

13:49.541 --> 13:51.208
What's up, man?
Heard you had a girl with you last night.

13:51.291 --> 13:52.583
-How does it matter to you?
-Bro.

13:54.041 --> 13:56.041
Who is this guy, man?
Looks so dashing!

13:56.125 --> 14:00.666
If he is like this, how lovely
might his sister or cousin be?

14:05.458 --> 14:06.291
Who are they, Narayan?

14:06.375 --> 14:08.458
Sir, these savages act
as if they're born on aphrodisiacs.

14:08.541 --> 14:10.916
Not even a female dog is safe
when they are around, sir.

14:13.375 --> 14:14.333
Why?!

14:17.166 --> 14:18.666
-Hey, Narayan.
-Sir?

14:18.750 --> 14:20.875
You're just showing me small fishes.

14:21.333 --> 14:24.125
Show me the big ones
and the sharks as well.

14:24.458 --> 14:28.416
Sir, catching small fish is fine.
There's no trouble.

14:28.500 --> 14:29.791
However, we really don't want big fish,

14:30.125 --> 14:32.250
and we definitely need to avoid sharks.

14:32.333 --> 14:33.791
Alright then, let's leave them.

14:33.916 --> 14:35.875
At least tell me
who are these big fish anyway?

14:36.458 --> 14:37.291
It's Poojary, sir.

14:40.083 --> 14:42.125
He's involved in
many illegal activities in this area,

14:42.291 --> 14:44.416
and many people work under him.

14:45.708 --> 14:46.583
And the shark?

14:47.708 --> 14:48.541
Kotian.

14:49.750 --> 14:51.125
He's extremely powerful.

14:51.333 --> 14:52.666
He's a white-collar criminal.

14:53.125 --> 14:54.666
He controls the entire port.

14:54.916 --> 14:57.833
Forget about touching him.
You can't even step foot in his territory.

15:09.375 --> 15:10.666
Hello, babies!

15:11.000 --> 15:12.875
Hey, darling, are you off to school?

15:13.000 --> 15:14.333
Come, I'll drop you.

15:14.416 --> 15:15.291
Alright?

15:15.375 --> 15:16.708
-Why are you scared?
-Hey!

15:18.000 --> 15:20.041
Come on, baby! I love you.

15:20.166 --> 15:22.083
Baby, come on.

15:22.625 --> 15:24.125
Why are you scared?

15:32.125 --> 15:36.041
You girls outnumber these three thugs.
Why do you fear them?

15:36.125 --> 15:37.541
Hey, who the hell are you?

15:39.208 --> 15:42.125
Don't expect someone
to always come and protect you.

15:42.250 --> 15:43.708
You need to protect yourselves.

15:45.291 --> 15:47.250
What can they do?

15:47.333 --> 15:49.125
Desperate fellows!
They have no one to question them!

15:49.708 --> 15:50.833
Just look at their faces!

15:51.958 --> 15:53.791
-How dare you?!
-Beat them.

15:54.083 --> 15:55.541
-Stop it!
-Hey!

15:56.166 --> 15:57.333
Will you torture them every day?

15:57.416 --> 15:58.250
-Let go.
-Beat them!

15:58.333 --> 16:00.250
Will you come here again?
Leave.

16:00.375 --> 16:01.291
Get out of here.

16:07.291 --> 16:08.333
Thanks!

16:09.750 --> 16:11.083
Thank you, sister!

16:19.750 --> 16:20.708
-Narayan.
-Sir.

16:21.125 --> 16:23.791
There's no need
for cops in this town.

16:24.083 --> 16:26.750
The women here
handle everything themselves.

16:26.958 --> 16:27.791
Yes, sir.

16:33.708 --> 16:34.916
There are a lot of challenges.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.291
-Yes, sir…
-Hello, everyone!

16:36.375 --> 16:37.375
-Hi, sir.
-Good evening.

16:37.500 --> 16:38.625
-Good evening, sir.
-Good evening, sir.

16:38.750 --> 16:39.833
-Hello, sir.
-Prabhakar.

16:41.416 --> 16:42.333
Rahul.

16:42.416 --> 16:43.541
-Sir.
-Rohan.

16:43.625 --> 16:44.458
-Hi.
-Hello, sir.

16:44.541 --> 16:45.375
-Hi.
-Sunil.

16:45.500 --> 16:46.333
-Hello.
-Hello, sir.

16:46.416 --> 16:47.375
-Vedanth.
-Sir.

16:47.458 --> 16:50.458
Vedanth IPS, right?

16:50.541 --> 16:52.250
Topper in the batch, gold medalist.

16:52.458 --> 16:54.125
-Very proud of you.
-Thank you, sir.

16:54.250 --> 16:56.375
Work in a way that makes
the entire department proud of you.

16:56.750 --> 16:57.583
-Okay?
-Yes, sir.

16:58.083 --> 16:59.000
Sir, please.

17:01.083 --> 17:03.958
Okay. Cheers everybody!

17:04.041 --> 17:04.958
-Cheers!
-Sir.

17:05.041 --> 17:06.791
Sir. Sorry, sir.

17:07.375 --> 17:08.541
I think you forgot.

17:08.791 --> 17:10.208
You're still wearing
the department's belt.

17:10.583 --> 17:12.166
-So?
-Sir, you shouldn't drink

17:12.291 --> 17:14.750
while wearing the department's
belt, cap, and stars.

17:14.833 --> 17:15.791
Hey, Veda!

17:15.875 --> 17:18.208
Hey, it's okay. He's absolutely correct.

17:18.375 --> 17:19.208
Just hold it.

17:19.875 --> 17:22.000
Sorry, I came in a hurry
and didn't realize.

17:22.083 --> 17:22.916
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

17:23.125 --> 17:24.375
Absolutely fine.

17:25.125 --> 17:25.958
Take them.

17:26.791 --> 17:28.166
-Okay, now I can drink?
-Yes, sir.

17:28.250 --> 17:29.125
Sure, sir.

17:30.083 --> 17:31.208
Thanks for reminding me.

17:33.750 --> 17:34.958
-Okay, enjoy!
-Thank you, sir.

17:35.041 --> 17:36.666
Enjoy! Have fun!

17:38.333 --> 17:41.500
Hey, Veda, what's wrong
with drinking while wearing the belt?

17:41.833 --> 17:44.041
It's not just wrong. It's a crime!

17:45.875 --> 17:47.625
-Have you seen the movie Sangliyana?
-Yes.

17:48.208 --> 17:50.083
Our Veda is remaking it.

17:54.041 --> 17:57.791
TRUTH ALWAYS TRIUMPHS

17:57.875 --> 18:02.416
VEDANTH PRABHAKAR

18:03.625 --> 18:04.458
-Sir.
-Hey, Narayan,

18:04.541 --> 18:05.916
how many times do I have to tell you?

18:06.166 --> 18:08.583
Where are the files I'm asking for?
What are these files?

18:08.666 --> 18:12.208
Sir, the files you're asking
for are in the drawer.

18:12.291 --> 18:13.500
-In the drawer?
-Yes, sir.

18:18.500 --> 18:21.083
-What is this?
-Sir, this is from the market.

18:21.166 --> 18:22.166
This is from the sand mafia.

18:22.250 --> 18:23.333
This one is from the harbor.

18:23.416 --> 18:24.791
Sir, this is export and import.

18:24.875 --> 18:26.583
Sir, this is from prostitution.

18:26.875 --> 18:28.041
This is from the pubs.

18:28.125 --> 18:30.666
-Sir, everything is covered here.
-Oh, really?

18:30.750 --> 18:31.666
-Right, sir.
-Is that all?

18:31.750 --> 18:34.875
No other jurisdiction covers
as much as we do.

18:35.625 --> 18:38.333
Alright, let's go for a round.

18:38.416 --> 18:39.875
Sir, we just went the other day.
Why again?

18:39.958 --> 18:41.333
This is different than the other day.

18:41.833 --> 18:42.666
Let's go.

18:55.750 --> 18:58.458
You would dare to touch me? Really?!

19:02.750 --> 19:05.750
Sir, don't just go around
because the roads are good,

19:05.958 --> 19:07.916
there's no guarantee that the people
you meet on the road are good.

19:12.250 --> 19:16.458
Before knowing what the place is,
learn about the guy who owns it.

19:16.625 --> 19:19.583
Hey, keep on going.
I'll see who dares to stop me.

19:19.666 --> 19:22.708
Hey, ACP, you look like
a baby who grew up in an AC room.

19:22.916 --> 19:24.416
Do you really want
to mess with a man like me?

19:24.500 --> 19:26.833
Do you know who I am?
Do you know who my father is?

19:26.916 --> 19:28.083
Come on! Bring it on!

19:28.166 --> 19:29.500
Try to touch me if you dare.

19:29.583 --> 19:33.041
Go home, turn on the AC,
and sleep with your wife or lover.

19:33.125 --> 19:35.500
Or else it will be a different place
where we'll put you to sleep.

19:35.583 --> 19:38.791
If you dare to touch me,
you'll end up somewhere without a trace.

19:45.833 --> 19:46.916
Let's clean the city!

19:47.000 --> 19:47.958
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

20:01.500 --> 20:02.333
SUPER COP VEDANTH PRABHAKAR
BUSTS MAFIA

20:04.291 --> 20:05.500
Sir, you're locking up

20:05.583 --> 20:07.125
-one gang after another each day.
-Come on.

20:07.250 --> 20:08.208
We're so proud of you, sir.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.541
Mr. Murthy, this is Mangalore.

20:11.291 --> 20:13.791
Many gold medalists
like you have come and gone.

20:14.291 --> 20:16.208
Let's see how long
the sounds of his guns last

20:16.583 --> 20:19.375
amidst the crime waves in this city.

20:22.458 --> 20:23.625
Who is that, Narayan?

20:24.208 --> 20:27.583
Sir, he is Ranganna. A journalist.

20:28.083 --> 20:29.458
He is both daring and honest.

20:29.750 --> 20:31.375
He acts like he's born for justice.

20:31.458 --> 20:34.458
He speaks his mind
without a shred of care.

20:36.458 --> 20:40.833
His actions are according to the book.
Sorry, sir, I'm helpless.

21:02.291 --> 21:03.750
Wow, look at our boss.

21:03.833 --> 21:06.625
Like a great lion,
he tackles everyone in his path.

21:06.708 --> 21:10.291
-Right?
-Hey, Govind, this rooster wakes up early,

21:10.375 --> 21:13.375
and wakes everyone up with his call!

21:13.500 --> 21:14.333
Do you know why?

21:14.416 --> 21:18.333
It's to wake people up
to start doing their work.

21:18.541 --> 21:22.083
But, the same people wake up

21:22.500 --> 21:26.166
and make a kebab out of that rooster
and then go to work.

21:26.416 --> 21:27.958
This rooster is also the same.

21:28.208 --> 21:29.250
It will wake you up.

21:29.458 --> 21:32.875
But we'll never know when
this one too becomes a kebab.

21:33.791 --> 21:35.083
A lion? Really?

21:35.166 --> 21:36.041
Shut up and eat.

21:39.375 --> 21:40.625
What's the hurry?

21:40.875 --> 21:41.875
There's no hurry.

21:42.250 --> 21:43.375
Today is said to be an auspicious day

21:43.458 --> 21:44.833
and whatever you do
will turn out very well.

21:45.083 --> 21:47.083
Did I ever ask you
to arrange my marriage?

21:47.375 --> 21:48.500
Can't you stay quiet?

21:48.583 --> 21:51.791
Veda, everything should happen
at the right time.

21:51.875 --> 21:53.458
-They're here.
-Don't make a long face,

21:53.541 --> 21:54.458
-smile a bit.
-Oh, here they are.

21:54.875 --> 21:55.833
-Welcome, sir.
-Hello, sir.

21:56.291 --> 21:57.125
Please come.

21:57.208 --> 21:58.041
-Hello.
-How are you?

21:58.125 --> 21:59.625
-I'm doing good.
-Please come in.

22:00.375 --> 22:01.458
Please come, sir.

22:03.375 --> 22:04.625
I'm a doctor in the army.

22:04.833 --> 22:06.541
-I'm okay.
-I'm home only for two months a year.

22:06.666 --> 22:07.791
-Please have it.
-Thank you.

22:07.875 --> 22:09.791
I have to be at the army base
for the rest of the year.

22:10.333 --> 22:11.750
My daughter is very independent.

22:11.833 --> 22:13.416
After her mother passed away,

22:13.500 --> 22:15.208
she has been handling
everything on her own.

22:15.583 --> 22:16.750
She's also a doctor.

22:16.958 --> 22:18.458
She works at the Manipal Hospital.

22:18.541 --> 22:20.416
Now she's preparing to be a surgeon.

22:20.500 --> 22:22.375
Sir, can you please call your daughter?

22:22.458 --> 22:24.000
Yeah, sure. Sneha!

22:24.250 --> 22:25.166
I'll leave.

22:25.250 --> 22:26.666
-Where are you going?
-Sneha.

22:26.750 --> 22:27.583
-Sit.
-What are you doing?

22:51.708 --> 22:53.083
-Hello.
-Hello.

22:53.500 --> 22:54.583
-Hi.
-Hi.

22:55.041 --> 22:56.958
If both of you want to talk,
just go ahead.

22:57.916 --> 22:58.791
Yeah, why not?

23:08.125 --> 23:09.000
So…

23:09.750 --> 23:13.208
-I… actually…
-I know what you're about to say.

23:13.875 --> 23:15.250
You don't like this at all.

23:16.125 --> 23:18.291
But your Dad forced you into it.

23:18.791 --> 23:20.666
The same goes for my dad.

23:21.166 --> 23:22.541
I understand your tension.

23:23.791 --> 23:25.750
You are a police officer,
and I am a doctor.

23:26.625 --> 23:28.333
We both will always be busy with our work.

23:29.041 --> 23:30.916
You're not sure whether things
will work out or not, right?

23:31.083 --> 23:34.166
-I was about to say that--
-Let's do one thing.

23:34.916 --> 23:36.791
Let's spend some time together,

23:38.208 --> 23:41.083
understand each other,
and then make a decision.

23:42.416 --> 23:43.541
If things work out, let's get married.

23:45.416 --> 23:48.083
Otherwise, you live your life
and I'll live mine.

23:48.625 --> 23:50.166
Why get confused? Let's keep it simple.

23:50.958 --> 23:51.791
What do you say?

23:53.458 --> 23:54.791
It's a deal then. Shall we go?

23:56.250 --> 24:02.000
When I open my eyes to the dawn

24:02.416 --> 24:08.083
I'll weave excuses to find you

24:08.291 --> 24:10.750
Until your words reach my heart

24:11.333 --> 24:14.083
I stood in silence

24:14.458 --> 24:20.708
Why does your smile
Shy away from my gaze?

24:20.791 --> 24:26.416
I honed my voice to echo your name

24:26.916 --> 24:33.416
Why not weave a sign for me?
I'll dash to your heart

24:36.125 --> 24:41.750
You blossomed in my heart,
Petal by petal

24:42.375 --> 24:48.375
You've filled my heart
With a symphony of joy

24:48.458 --> 24:54.250
How can I resist your warmth
In a world of grace and laughter?

24:54.750 --> 25:00.416
You linger in my thoughts
A melody in countless forms

25:28.500 --> 25:30.208
Couldn't you get a helmet
with a different color?

25:32.250 --> 25:38.166
Bless me with the wish
To be able to irritate you daily

25:38.250 --> 25:40.666
With you, my life is complete
Unlike the crescent moon

25:44.625 --> 25:47.458
When you come close

25:47.750 --> 25:52.958
It feels like my heart starts dancing

25:53.750 --> 25:55.833
-Shall we have ice cream?
-Okay.

25:55.916 --> 25:56.750
Yeah.

25:57.541 --> 25:58.958
There's a Polar Express nearby.

25:59.375 --> 26:02.375
-Mom!
-Roopa, what happened?

26:02.625 --> 26:05.500
-Oh, no! Help her!
-Stop, stop, stop!

26:05.875 --> 26:07.583
-Drink some water. Roopa!
-Mom!

26:08.916 --> 26:11.250
-What happened?
-Her pain suddenly shot up.

26:11.791 --> 26:13.333
We have to take her to the hospital now!

26:13.541 --> 26:14.416
Okay.

26:14.750 --> 26:15.625
Careful.

26:18.625 --> 26:19.625
It's okay. It's okay.

26:20.208 --> 26:21.791
Don't worry, you will be fine.

26:21.875 --> 26:23.041
You're going to be perfectly fine.

26:23.458 --> 26:24.875
Vedanth, she's unconscious.

26:26.333 --> 26:27.250
Roopa!

26:29.000 --> 26:29.958
We have arrived at the hospital.

26:40.458 --> 26:41.583
Don't worry, Sneha.

26:42.375 --> 26:45.291
Both the mother
and the child will be safe.

26:45.375 --> 26:46.791
God is so cruel, isn't he?

26:47.791 --> 26:49.375
He gives all the pain
and suffering to women.

26:51.125 --> 26:53.041
At least, he could have given
the pain of childbirth to men.

26:56.458 --> 26:57.791
God isn't so foolish.

26:58.583 --> 27:02.541
He knows that men lack
the strength of women,

27:04.583 --> 27:07.875
which is why the pain
of childbirth is given to women.

27:09.166 --> 27:11.666
If men were given
the responsibility of childbirth,

27:13.208 --> 27:15.208
there wouldn't be a single man
left in the world.

27:27.041 --> 27:28.541
Oh! You're here!

27:28.791 --> 27:30.333
Dad, I like him.

27:31.291 --> 27:32.416
Ask him if he likes me.

28:07.666 --> 28:09.083
I'm tired.

28:09.750 --> 28:11.291
It's too hot, right?

28:11.375 --> 28:12.875
That's why I said
we'll come in the evening.

28:20.416 --> 28:22.166
Mom, let's sit for a while and leave.

28:22.250 --> 28:23.541
Hey! Let me go.

28:23.625 --> 28:24.750
-Hey! Mom!
-Let go.

28:24.833 --> 28:25.666
Oh, no!

28:27.541 --> 28:29.375
-Let me go.
-Navya.

28:29.458 --> 28:30.875
-Mom.
-Someone please save her.

28:32.125 --> 28:34.291
Oh, no! Navya!

28:34.375 --> 28:36.125
Please save her.

28:36.208 --> 28:37.125
Navya!

28:39.208 --> 28:40.125
Tell the truth.

28:42.125 --> 28:44.416
I'll tell you.

28:44.500 --> 28:47.125
Bring my boss here
if you have the courage.

28:47.208 --> 28:48.041
Jackie.

28:48.500 --> 28:51.000
Do you know the area he's in?

28:51.083 --> 28:52.583
He's in Poojari's area.

28:55.166 --> 28:59.833
If you have the courage,
get him from Poojari's area.

29:01.958 --> 29:03.625
Alright. I'll inform you.

29:08.291 --> 29:11.041
Sir, Poojari's area is very dangerous.

29:11.166 --> 29:12.000
Let's not go there.

29:12.458 --> 29:13.333
Listen to me, sir.

29:44.833 --> 29:48.416
Hey! This is the farthest
the police have come.

29:48.500 --> 29:51.500
If you come an inch forward,
I guarantee you won't go back.

29:52.041 --> 29:52.875
Charge!

29:54.583 --> 29:55.416
Beat him!

30:03.750 --> 30:04.583
Sir!

30:25.500 --> 30:26.791
Come!

30:59.583 --> 31:00.416
Hey!

31:13.375 --> 31:14.916
Sir! Oh, no! Poojari boss!

31:15.000 --> 31:19.125
You come into my area
and lock up my people?

31:19.208 --> 31:22.625
If anyone disrupts
the law and order, I'll arrest them.

31:23.208 --> 31:25.333
-What makes one break law and order?
-Boss…

31:25.416 --> 31:26.875
Oh, no! Boss!

31:27.750 --> 31:29.708
-Will this break the law and order?
-Boss, listen…

31:29.791 --> 31:31.666
Don't be tense.
He's a new inspector.

31:31.750 --> 31:32.583
I'll talk to him.

31:38.916 --> 31:40.916
Will this action disrupt
the law and order?

32:12.541 --> 32:13.375
Poojari?

32:17.791 --> 32:18.666
Open the cell.

32:23.125 --> 32:23.958
PRISON

32:40.416 --> 32:43.333
-Hey, Sania. Stop.
-Dad, catch me!

32:43.416 --> 32:45.375
-I caught you!
-This is cheating.

32:45.458 --> 32:46.750
-Cheating.
-No! I did not cheat.

32:47.041 --> 32:48.416
No! I did not cheat.

32:48.500 --> 32:49.333
Hello.

32:49.416 --> 32:51.041
-Boss, ACP Vedanth has
-Cheating…

32:51.125 --> 32:53.125
-arrested Poojari.
-One minute.

32:53.958 --> 32:54.791
-Really?
-Yes.

32:54.875 --> 32:56.208
-Mummy!
-Do something, Boss.

32:56.291 --> 32:57.458
-He's cheating.
-Sit.

32:57.541 --> 33:00.208
-Sir, please save her.
-Crying won't change a thing.

33:00.291 --> 33:02.666
-We have to follow the procedure.
-Sir, please come fast.

33:02.750 --> 33:04.250
Sir, they'll harm her.

33:04.333 --> 33:06.375
-I'm begging you.
-Listen to me.

33:06.666 --> 33:07.541
Be quiet for a minute.

33:08.250 --> 33:10.458
-Sir.
-Vedanth, come to my office.

33:10.625 --> 33:13.208
Sure, sir. I've some work.
I'll complete it and come there.

33:13.291 --> 33:14.916
-No, Vedanth. Come immediately.
-We have our rules.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.958
Sir, I need to attend to a case.

33:17.041 --> 33:19.541
You're not the only one working
in a station. There are others.

33:19.625 --> 33:20.833
No more discussion, Vedanth.

33:20.916 --> 33:22.125
-It's an order.
-Sir.

33:22.208 --> 33:25.458
-Please hurry up, sir.
-Listen to me. Take a seat.

33:25.541 --> 33:28.791
Please do something.

33:28.875 --> 33:30.583
-At ease.
-Sir.

33:30.958 --> 33:32.375
I'm very proud of you, Vedanth.

33:32.666 --> 33:35.166
The city has transformed
significantly since your arrival.

33:35.250 --> 33:37.375
You've enhanced
our department's reputation.

33:37.500 --> 33:38.875
-Well done!
-Thank you, sir.

33:39.708 --> 33:41.291
It's enough. Stop it.

33:41.916 --> 33:44.416
-Sir?
-What you heard is right.

33:44.666 --> 33:46.791
-Stop it right away.
-I don't get it.

33:47.583 --> 33:49.250
I'm doing the right thing.

33:49.583 --> 33:53.708
Until now, you've done
what felt right for you.

33:53.791 --> 33:57.500
From now on, do what feels right for us.

33:57.958 --> 33:59.875
I'm sorry, sir. What do you mean?

34:00.083 --> 34:02.791
Our department is
part of a system, Vedanth.

34:02.875 --> 34:05.541
We should work for each other in a system.

34:05.625 --> 34:08.125
Only then, everything
happens systematically.

34:08.208 --> 34:12.875
If everything happens
systematically, all of us will be happy.

34:12.958 --> 34:15.916
Okay, sir. I should stop what I'm doing.

34:16.375 --> 34:18.166
-That's it, sir?
-No, Vedanth.

34:18.458 --> 34:19.666
You're mistaken about that.

34:19.750 --> 34:21.375
You like being a hero, right?

34:21.500 --> 34:25.083
You enjoy being featured in
newspapers and on television.

34:25.625 --> 34:26.958
I'll make arrangements.

34:27.041 --> 34:29.333
Arrest some people
and kill them in an encounter.

34:29.416 --> 34:31.208
Become a hero. Who's stopping you?

34:32.291 --> 34:36.750
From now on, do only what I say.

34:37.166 --> 34:38.083
Superb, sir!

34:38.541 --> 34:41.375
My father beamed with pride
when he spoke about you.

34:41.708 --> 34:43.625
But if my father knows the real you…

34:43.708 --> 34:46.166
Veda! Do you know who you're talking to?

34:46.416 --> 34:48.208
-What's this, Prabhakar?
-Sir.

34:48.291 --> 34:51.416
Didn't you tell your son
how he got this job?

34:51.500 --> 34:54.500
He believes his gold medal
got him this job.

34:55.166 --> 34:57.583
Sorry, sir. Give me a minute.
I'll talk to him.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.458
Hey, Veda! What are you talking about?

35:00.958 --> 35:03.125
You won't get a job in this area
even if you give two crore rupees.

35:03.291 --> 35:05.750
He gave us this job
for just 50 lakh rupees.

35:05.916 --> 35:07.208
What are you talking
about in front of him?

35:07.291 --> 35:08.833
-Hey, Prabhakar.
-Sir.

35:09.125 --> 35:11.666
He's still a kid. Hot-tempered.

35:12.416 --> 35:14.625
We'll teach him.

35:14.916 --> 35:17.583
-Okay, sir.
-Take your time and teach him.

35:17.666 --> 35:18.500
-Okay?
-Okay, sir.

35:19.291 --> 35:21.458
Hey! Tell them to release Poojari.

35:21.541 --> 35:23.000
What happened to you?
Don't you think at all?

35:23.708 --> 35:25.541
-What are you doing?
-Forget about me.

35:25.625 --> 35:26.791
What are you doing?

35:26.875 --> 35:28.666
-What?
-Are you taking a bribe as well?

35:28.750 --> 35:30.458
As if I have done something illegal.

35:31.083 --> 35:32.083
Everyone accepts bribes.

35:33.208 --> 35:34.666
Aren't you ashamed to talk like this?

35:34.750 --> 35:35.833
Why should I be ashamed?

35:36.333 --> 35:37.666
Did I hurt someone?

35:37.750 --> 35:39.250
What happens if I take 100 or 200 rupees?

35:39.333 --> 35:40.958
You're not hurting anyone.

35:41.375 --> 35:45.083
But the person giving you
money would've hurt someone.

35:45.166 --> 35:46.333
This is how the system works.

35:46.625 --> 35:49.458
We've to do this to survive
in the department.

35:49.625 --> 35:51.375
If we object, we'll be swept away.

35:52.083 --> 35:53.416
You speak so well, Dad.

35:53.958 --> 35:55.666
I thought you were a hero.

35:55.958 --> 35:58.708
I'm a hero. I'm a hero to my home.

35:59.375 --> 36:00.333
When you were young,

36:00.416 --> 36:03.375
I gave you birthday gifts, a bike,
and admitted you to a private school.

36:03.833 --> 36:06.333
Do you think I can afford
such a luxurious life with my salary?

36:06.541 --> 36:08.666
If we had to live like this
by taking a bribe,

36:09.125 --> 36:10.875
I would've lived with what we had.

36:10.958 --> 36:14.625
If we have to lose ourselves
to live a practical life,

36:14.791 --> 36:16.916
what's the point of living?

36:17.166 --> 36:19.750
You're great, son!

36:20.458 --> 36:22.625
Alright. Let's move on.

36:22.875 --> 36:25.625
Your mother lived six more years
despite having cancer.

36:25.916 --> 36:27.208
What price will you pay for it?

36:29.041 --> 36:32.291
You were crying beside
your mom in the hospital.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.875
What price will you pay
for that child's tears?

36:35.875 --> 36:39.291
Your mother lived six more years
thanks to my bribe money.

36:40.041 --> 36:41.416
If I hadn't accepted bribes,

36:41.500 --> 36:43.291
we wouldn't have been able
to afford those treatments.

36:45.708 --> 36:48.041
I'm always a hero to my family.

36:48.875 --> 36:49.750
A hero.

36:56.416 --> 36:57.625
Don't worry too much.

36:58.041 --> 36:59.625
If they fight back, we'll be helpless.

37:00.541 --> 37:02.041
Learn to be a part of the system.

37:07.291 --> 37:10.250
Veda… live with a mask.

37:35.750 --> 37:37.500
If they fight back, we'll be helpless.

37:38.041 --> 37:39.208
Be a part of the system.

37:52.250 --> 37:53.666
-You should've filled petrol.
-I'll keep it here.

37:53.750 --> 37:54.583
-Pour it later.
-Okay.

38:04.125 --> 38:07.541
Boss, we had kidnapped a girl.
She escaped.

38:09.166 --> 38:11.791
If you commit a crime,
you should leave no traces behind.

38:11.875 --> 38:12.791
Go to the factory!

38:13.958 --> 38:15.750
I will take care of anyone who comes
and tries to stop us.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.458
Are you all human beings?

38:20.541 --> 38:23.416
I screamed at the top of my lungs
that my daughter had been kidnapped.

38:23.500 --> 38:24.666
-Please rescue her!
-Let's talk inside.

38:24.750 --> 38:25.583
-You all will rot in hell!
-Don't scream here.

38:25.666 --> 38:27.208
-Please come inside.
-Why should I?

38:27.291 --> 38:28.791
-What is left to discuss with you?
-Take her.

38:28.875 --> 38:30.250
-I came…
-Listen to me, ma'am.

38:30.333 --> 38:31.166
Get out!

38:31.250 --> 38:32.458
-What should I discuss?
-What's going on?

38:32.541 --> 38:34.458
-You're not police officers.
-Hear us out.

38:34.541 --> 38:37.958
-You rascals!
-Don't speak to the police like that.

38:38.041 --> 38:39.416
-Please come inside, let's talk.
-Get lost.

38:39.500 --> 38:41.750
-Get out! See what they've done here!
-Brother.

38:41.833 --> 38:43.250
Look at the fate of my daughter!

38:43.333 --> 38:45.791
You all destroyed her!

38:46.166 --> 38:47.333
My daughter's life has been destroyed,

38:47.416 --> 38:48.958
-all thanks to you cops!
-Let's talk inside,

38:49.375 --> 38:51.041
-You dare to call yourself a cop?!
-Sir.

38:51.166 --> 38:52.125
-Sir…
-You are unfit!

38:52.208 --> 38:54.041
-You're unfit!
-Please leave, sir. I will handle this.

38:54.125 --> 38:55.583
I will handle this.

38:55.666 --> 38:56.541
Please be quiet!

38:56.625 --> 38:58.708
Ma'am, please come inside
so we can talk.

38:58.791 --> 38:59.916
Don't talk to us like that.

39:00.041 --> 39:01.458
How dare you talk
to the police like that?

39:04.375 --> 39:08.333
My daughter was not raped by those thugs!

39:10.333 --> 39:12.375
You rascals did that to her!

39:36.791 --> 39:38.541
Why don't you rascals kill her?!

39:41.458 --> 39:43.041
Just kill her!

39:43.125 --> 39:45.208
-Just kill her-- Navya?
-We'll set up an inquiry.

39:52.750 --> 39:53.833
Hey!

40:00.666 --> 40:01.708
Navya!

40:09.750 --> 40:10.750
Narayan!

40:11.083 --> 40:12.166
Oh, God!

40:21.541 --> 40:22.958
Oh, God!

40:29.166 --> 40:30.250
Oh, no!

40:35.500 --> 40:36.958
Oh, no!

40:44.625 --> 40:46.583
Navya!

40:48.458 --> 40:51.500
Oh, no!

40:51.958 --> 40:54.333
Oh, God!

41:03.875 --> 41:07.583
Navya! Oh, no! Oh, God!

41:09.333 --> 41:10.958
Did she die?

41:13.791 --> 41:14.833
Navya!

41:20.125 --> 41:22.083
Is she alive or dead?

41:28.541 --> 41:29.416
She's dead, sir.

41:32.333 --> 41:33.250
Navya!

41:41.333 --> 41:44.708
TRUTH ALWAYS TRIUMPHS

41:44.791 --> 41:46.083
Navya!

41:46.166 --> 41:47.958
Oh, no!

41:48.750 --> 41:49.583
Narayan!

41:50.333 --> 41:53.416
Oh, God!

41:54.916 --> 41:57.041
-Sir?
-Navya…

41:57.125 --> 41:59.916
Just write a report that she committed
suicide after a break up.

42:07.166 --> 42:08.458
Oh, no!

42:13.333 --> 42:17.666
Whoever did this to my daughter
should be destroyed!

42:20.250 --> 42:23.458
They should die a cruel death!

42:26.666 --> 42:29.291
You should protect the people
if you're wearing the uniform,

42:29.458 --> 42:33.375
but providing justice
doesn't require wearing it.

42:36.416 --> 42:38.291
You should just
have the heart to do it.

42:58.666 --> 43:00.750
God is so cruel!

43:01.208 --> 43:02.708
This is injustice!

43:02.791 --> 43:04.958
She was too young to die!

43:05.041 --> 43:06.833
She was so beautiful.

43:06.916 --> 43:10.041
We could've enjoyed her
for a few more days.

43:10.416 --> 43:12.666
You've been crying for so long.

43:12.750 --> 43:14.541
Just calm down.

43:14.625 --> 43:17.208
God has no mercy!

43:17.291 --> 43:20.666
Hey, I can understand your pain.

43:20.750 --> 43:23.041
We should simply accept fate as it is.

43:23.125 --> 43:25.333
Bro, I can't bear to watch his pain.

43:25.458 --> 43:28.791
-Please do something.
-What do you expect me to do?

43:29.958 --> 43:33.541
Bro, even if we can't watch
the movie in the cinema,

43:33.791 --> 43:37.291
we'll still be able to see it
on TV or on our phones, right?

43:38.083 --> 43:41.500
At least, arrange a cell phone for us.

43:41.583 --> 43:46.000
Where can I get a cell phone at this hour?

43:48.333 --> 43:50.375
-Hey, kid.
-Yes, big brother?

43:51.791 --> 43:53.250
Do you have a sister?

43:53.375 --> 43:54.250
No, big brother.

43:56.166 --> 43:57.041
A mom?

43:58.291 --> 44:00.208
No, boss. I'm an orphan.

44:00.333 --> 44:02.041
Why don't you come instead?

44:02.375 --> 44:03.208
Big brother?

44:03.625 --> 44:06.791
He asked for a mobile phone,
not a charger.

44:06.875 --> 44:08.250
Hey! Get lost!

44:14.041 --> 44:15.583
Hey! Who is that?

44:15.666 --> 44:17.166
Hey! Go and check.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.625
Hey! Who the heck are you?!

44:59.541 --> 45:01.958
Hey! Come on, guys!

45:05.291 --> 45:06.291
Hey!

45:19.791 --> 45:20.666
Hey!

46:59.666 --> 47:00.583
Leave me, please!

48:26.500 --> 48:27.375
Hey!

48:41.750 --> 48:42.625
Hey!

48:57.791 --> 49:00.291
Please let me go.

50:04.250 --> 50:05.666
Oh, God!

50:06.708 --> 50:07.833
What's all this?

50:09.208 --> 50:10.250
Everyone…

50:20.375 --> 50:21.291
Hey! Who are you?!

50:21.541 --> 50:23.458
Hey! Who are you?! Don't be afraid.

50:23.541 --> 50:24.708
I'm a cop.

50:25.375 --> 50:26.958
Hey! Who are you?!

50:27.041 --> 50:27.958
Did you witness what happened here?

50:29.583 --> 50:32.166
Who killed these men?
How many were there?

50:32.583 --> 50:34.083
Yes? How many?

50:34.708 --> 50:35.916
-One…
-Only one?

50:36.708 --> 50:38.208
Who was he? How did he look?

50:39.208 --> 50:40.750
How did he look?

50:41.625 --> 50:42.500
Don't be afraid. Tell me.

50:43.000 --> 50:43.875
Tell me.

50:51.916 --> 50:53.375
Bagheera!

51:10.500 --> 51:12.791
Who is this killer Bagheera?

51:12.875 --> 51:15.916
A massacre in the fish oil factory.

51:16.000 --> 51:19.000
It's inhumane the way
he has killed these men.

51:19.083 --> 51:21.833
We're unable to get a death count
of the people who are killed.

51:21.916 --> 51:24.250
We don't know who or what he is.

51:24.500 --> 51:26.583
The people who are dead were criminals.

51:26.666 --> 51:30.541
You idiots! He is nothing
but an avatar of Kalki.

51:30.625 --> 51:33.625
In Kali Yuga, the pots of people's sins
are filled to the brim.

51:33.708 --> 51:36.541
That is why Kalki has taken an avatar.

51:36.625 --> 51:39.166
There will be carnage from now on.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.750
Given the inhumane way
these men were killed,

51:43.791 --> 51:46.625
the killer must be nothing
but a bloodsucking demon.

51:58.083 --> 51:59.500
-Sir!
-Sir.

52:15.000 --> 52:15.875
Clean it further.

52:20.500 --> 52:21.958
Check whether it's an arm or a leg.

52:23.500 --> 52:24.333
Sir.

52:25.166 --> 52:28.166
-Is anyone alive, Narayan?
-I'm not able to make out, sir.

52:28.250 --> 52:30.875
The way these men were killed,
the killer must have been in a rage.

52:30.958 --> 52:31.875
What's the body count?

52:32.583 --> 52:34.125
I'm not able to make that out either.

52:34.208 --> 52:37.333
We might get an estimate
after we rejoin the body parts.

52:42.625 --> 52:44.375
Okay. Finish the on-site investigation.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.541
They were obliterated! Those dogs!

52:49.833 --> 52:51.125
They died like dogs!

52:51.416 --> 52:54.833
No other daughter should meet
the same fate as mine!

52:56.708 --> 52:58.166
They got obliterated!

52:58.250 --> 53:00.833
Are you saying these men were
responsible for your daughter's death?

53:01.083 --> 53:03.166
The killings are so inhumane.
Who might be the perpetrator?

53:03.250 --> 53:07.583
No one gave me justice
when my daughter was killed.

53:07.833 --> 53:09.583
But God delivered it.

53:09.916 --> 53:11.791
God delivered justice!

53:24.166 --> 53:26.458
Blood star

53:26.791 --> 53:29.833
Storm ahead and attack!

53:30.208 --> 53:32.291
O' vicious fighter!

53:32.833 --> 53:35.583
Praise be to Bagheera!

53:35.833 --> 53:36.750
Destroy!

53:36.833 --> 53:39.750
Make amends in the arena!

53:39.958 --> 53:41.833
Danger is your middle name!

53:41.916 --> 53:45.541
Destroy the evil

53:45.875 --> 53:47.833
-You bloodsucking demon!
-Bagheera!

53:47.916 --> 53:51.583
Truth, honor, justice
Truth always triumphs

53:59.500 --> 54:01.750
My daughter has been abducted, sir!

54:02.500 --> 54:03.500
Please save her!

54:04.750 --> 54:06.958
Blood star

54:07.208 --> 54:10.291
Storm ahead and attack!

54:10.666 --> 54:13.000
O' vicious fighter!

54:13.333 --> 54:16.041
Praise be to Bagheera!

54:16.125 --> 54:18.208
Don't come closer. I will kill her.

54:27.375 --> 54:29.833
Boss, our police station's vaastu
seems to be lucky.

54:29.916 --> 54:32.166
What makes you believe
in that all of a sudden?

54:32.375 --> 54:33.833
We need not do any work.

54:34.458 --> 54:37.166
Any complaint we get
is resolved within a few days.

54:37.291 --> 54:41.000
Why bring her to the police station
if you weren't the ones who rescued her?

54:41.208 --> 54:42.541
Bagheera is doing all the work for us.

54:44.958 --> 54:45.916
Who saved you?

54:46.000 --> 54:47.833
He had a mask on his face.

54:49.791 --> 54:52.041
I couldn't make out.
But I saw his eyes.

54:52.125 --> 54:55.041
Like Jatadhara, controlling the rage
Who holds Ganga's fury in a cage

54:55.125 --> 54:57.750
A world of patience, deep and wide
But beware when it turns the tide!

54:58.125 --> 54:59.500
He's terror unleashed

54:59.583 --> 55:01.041
-Shiva's fury alive
-It's a waste to talk to him.

55:01.125 --> 55:03.833
-He's Ravana with Rama's qualities
-Get up. Come on.

55:03.958 --> 55:06.833
Roaring, revolting, raging, ruling

55:07.000 --> 55:10.000
He's off to be Satan
In the world of demons and devils

55:10.083 --> 55:12.791
Amazing! Blazing!
Seizing! Arising!

55:12.875 --> 55:16.083
Remember ember entering the hearth
To show the dad the deed that he did

55:16.166 --> 55:21.958
Destroy!
Storm ahead and attack!

55:22.041 --> 55:27.916
Destroy the evil
You bloodsucking demon!

55:28.000 --> 55:31.791
Truth, honor, justice!
Truth always triumphs

55:49.208 --> 55:50.041
Sir.

55:50.541 --> 55:53.416
-What is it, Narayan?
-It's my son's birthday today.

55:53.666 --> 55:54.625
I have arranged a small party.

55:54.750 --> 55:55.583
You should come.

55:55.666 --> 55:57.333
-Okay, I will be there.
-Yes, sir.

56:07.291 --> 56:08.125
Narayan.

56:08.583 --> 56:10.000
-Narayan.
-Sir!

56:10.291 --> 56:14.000
Narayan, you said there was
a party, but no one is here.

56:14.166 --> 56:16.625
The party is only for you.

56:17.083 --> 56:19.958
Hey, Chinnu. Look who's here.

56:25.583 --> 56:27.125
This is my son, Poorna.

56:29.083 --> 56:30.333
Sir is here. Salute him.

56:30.416 --> 56:32.875
-Salute him.
-Hi, Poorna. Happy birthday.

56:34.083 --> 56:34.916
Go on.

56:35.083 --> 56:36.000
Bye.

56:37.041 --> 56:37.875
-Narayan.
-Sir.

56:38.250 --> 56:39.375
You've only invited me.

56:39.833 --> 56:40.750
Haven't you invited anyone else?

56:40.833 --> 56:43.291
Sir… you are different.

56:45.333 --> 56:46.416
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

56:55.291 --> 57:00.791
Sir, my wife died during childbirth.

57:01.666 --> 57:04.500
I don't know if it's karma
coming back to me,

57:05.291 --> 57:06.541
but my son is challenged.

57:07.416 --> 57:09.625
Narayan, don't worry.

57:09.750 --> 57:11.541
Why have these negative thoughts
on your son's birthday?

57:11.958 --> 57:12.791
Just relax.

57:16.333 --> 57:18.625
Narayan, drink slowly.

57:18.916 --> 57:19.958
You can't handle it otherwise.

57:20.041 --> 57:20.916
Sir,

57:21.458 --> 57:24.125
my life is filled
with more accumulated wealth,

57:24.208 --> 57:27.458
pain, and bad deeds than I can handle.

57:27.541 --> 57:29.750
Having more alcohol than
I can handle is the least of my worries.

57:33.125 --> 57:35.416
Narayan, that's enough.
Have dinner and go to bed.

57:35.750 --> 57:38.166
Sir, I'll sleep.

57:38.666 --> 57:41.416
I'll sleep like a baby today.

57:41.500 --> 57:42.333
Do you know why?

57:42.875 --> 57:45.208
Because you are here.

57:47.416 --> 57:50.000
Everyone will sleep peacefully
knowing you're here.

57:51.041 --> 57:54.541
Sir, I felt people like me would
get challenged kids like I did.

57:54.750 --> 57:55.583
No, sir.

57:55.875 --> 57:57.333
Good kids will be born.

57:57.875 --> 58:00.541
Yes, sir. Good kids…

58:06.083 --> 58:07.250
-Help…
-What happened?

58:07.333 --> 58:08.541
Look at my daughter, sir.

58:08.875 --> 58:10.791
Take her to the hospital.
Take her immediately!

58:14.916 --> 58:17.166
Blood star

58:17.416 --> 58:20.333
Storm ahead and attack!

58:20.875 --> 58:22.250
O' vicious fighter!

58:22.333 --> 58:24.875
Sir, these events are quite commonplace.

58:25.000 --> 58:26.208
Please don't get worried about them.

58:26.333 --> 58:27.583
You do as you wish, sir.

58:36.958 --> 58:38.958
Bagheera!

58:39.291 --> 58:42.166
Like Jatadhara, controlling the rage
Who holds Ganga's fury in a cage

58:42.250 --> 58:44.958
A world of patience, deep and wide
But beware when it turns the tide!

58:45.208 --> 58:48.208
He's terror unleashed
Shiva's fury alive

58:48.291 --> 58:51.000
He's Ravana with Rama's qualities

58:51.166 --> 58:54.041
Roaring, revolting, raging, ruling

58:54.125 --> 58:57.208
He's off to be Satan
In the world of demons and devils

58:57.291 --> 59:00.041
Amazing! Blazing!
Seizing! Arising!

59:00.125 --> 59:03.166
Remember ember entering the hearth
To show the dad the deed that he did

59:03.250 --> 59:09.125
He's here to destroy
Crush with all his might!

59:09.208 --> 59:15.125
Destroy the evil
You bloodsucking demon!

59:15.208 --> 59:19.000
Truth, honor, justice!
Truth always triumphs

59:33.333 --> 59:34.166
BAGHEERA'S VERDICT

59:44.083 --> 59:46.250
Blood star

59:46.708 --> 59:49.500
Storm ahead and attack

59:50.083 --> 59:52.458
O' vicious fighter!

59:52.666 --> 59:55.541
Praise be to Bagheera!

01:00:08.125 --> 01:00:10.291
Blood star

01:00:10.666 --> 01:00:13.541
Storm ahead and attack!

01:00:17.666 --> 01:00:19.250
JUSTICE FOR SALE!
SALESMAN OF THE YEAR ACP VEDANTH

01:00:29.625 --> 01:00:30.500
Did your dad leave?

01:00:30.583 --> 01:00:32.916
-Yes, Uncle. He left yesterday.
-Oh, he's here.

01:00:34.166 --> 01:00:35.000
Hi.

01:00:35.083 --> 01:00:37.541
I've been calling
and texting you for a while now.

01:00:37.625 --> 01:00:40.125
I guess you were busy.
I totally understand.

01:00:40.375 --> 01:00:42.333
That's why I came to meet you.

01:00:42.666 --> 01:00:44.625
I didn't respond to your calls and texts,

01:00:44.958 --> 01:00:47.291
not because I was busy,
but because I simply didn't want to talk.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Hey, Veda! What are you saying?

01:00:50.083 --> 01:00:51.833
This doesn't concern you, Dad.

01:00:51.958 --> 01:00:53.375
It's better if you keep quiet.

01:00:53.458 --> 01:00:54.625
You don't want to talk to me?

01:00:54.958 --> 01:00:55.875
Why? What happened?

01:00:56.583 --> 01:00:58.333
-Everything was going so well.
-Look!

01:00:59.083 --> 01:01:00.000
You said it yourself,

01:01:00.375 --> 01:01:02.083
"Let's spend some time together.

01:01:02.250 --> 01:01:03.583
Let's understand each other.

01:01:03.791 --> 01:01:05.958
Let's get married only if we like
each other."

01:01:06.541 --> 01:01:07.583
I don't like you anymore.

01:01:08.541 --> 01:01:09.375
I don't want to marry you.

01:01:10.125 --> 01:01:11.500
Then why did you get engaged to me?

01:01:12.083 --> 01:01:13.208
It's not like we got married.

01:01:13.833 --> 01:01:16.750
Many people get a divorce after marriage
because the relationship didn't work out.

01:01:17.458 --> 01:01:19.333
But I'm informing you well in advance.

01:01:21.083 --> 01:01:22.250
You live your life…

01:01:23.291 --> 01:01:24.333
and I'll live mine.

01:01:27.375 --> 01:01:28.791
-Hey! What's wrong with you?
-Uncle.

01:01:29.708 --> 01:01:31.416
If he's being so blunt,

01:01:31.708 --> 01:01:33.291
it means he didn't like me.

01:01:35.708 --> 01:01:37.291
I was foolish to pursue him.

01:01:42.791 --> 01:01:46.125
You're not the Vedanth I liked.
You've changed a lot!

01:01:49.625 --> 01:01:50.500
Fine.

01:01:50.583 --> 01:01:51.833
You live your life.

01:01:52.166 --> 01:01:53.166
And I'll live mine.

01:02:34.791 --> 01:02:36.708
Hey! What's going on, Ranganna?

01:02:36.791 --> 01:02:39.375
Until now, I've given you the liberty
to write any article you want.

01:02:39.458 --> 01:02:41.083
But now you're attempting
to write about Poojari.

01:02:41.166 --> 01:02:42.375
He won't spare you!

01:02:42.458 --> 01:02:43.333
Listen to me!

01:02:43.416 --> 01:02:45.666
If I were easily frightened, I would have
chosen a different profession.

01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:46.750
I wouldn't have become a journalist.

01:02:46.833 --> 01:02:49.041
Hey! Are you crazy?
Listen to me!

01:02:49.166 --> 01:02:50.166
Don't say anything, sir.

01:02:50.250 --> 01:02:52.625
If you don't publish the article tomorrow,
I'll post it on social media.

01:02:53.125 --> 01:02:53.958
The rest is up to you.

01:02:57.833 --> 01:02:59.416
Brother? It's our journalist Ranganna…

01:02:59.833 --> 01:03:01.833
He's discovered many of your secrets.

01:03:01.916 --> 01:03:04.958
He's threatening to post on social media
if I don't publish his article.

01:03:05.041 --> 01:03:06.458
He won't listen to me, brother.

01:03:12.166 --> 01:03:13.833
Why do you want to meddle
in other people's business?

01:03:13.916 --> 01:03:16.375
Don't forget that you have
a wife and a kid!

01:03:16.583 --> 01:03:19.041
-Can't you be quiet?
-What did I do, honey?

01:03:19.166 --> 01:03:20.708
I just wrote about what he did!

01:03:20.791 --> 01:03:22.250
You know what kind
of people they are, right?

01:03:22.625 --> 01:03:24.000
Look! If I get scared by them,

01:03:24.416 --> 01:03:27.208
it'll also affect
our son's future. Get it?

01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:38.500
Dad!

01:03:38.583 --> 01:03:40.875
-Son!
-You dare write about us?

01:03:40.958 --> 01:03:43.791
-Dad!
-Let me go!

01:03:44.083 --> 01:03:46.500
-Dad!
-Step aside! Move!

01:03:48.041 --> 01:03:50.750
-Move it!
-Hey! Who is that? Step aside!

01:03:54.333 --> 01:03:55.583
How did this happen?

01:03:57.375 --> 01:03:58.625
Did someone witness it?

01:04:04.416 --> 01:04:06.000
-Nobody did?
-Dad!

01:04:08.916 --> 01:04:12.458
The body appears to have been
mauled to death by dogs.

01:04:13.333 --> 01:04:14.833
These stray dogs, man!

01:04:15.041 --> 01:04:15.875
Prakash?

01:04:16.291 --> 01:04:18.583
I spoke to the municipality so many times…

01:04:18.666 --> 01:04:21.250
about the stray dog issue in our area,

01:04:21.333 --> 01:04:23.000
and asked them to catch those dogs.

01:04:23.125 --> 01:04:24.541
They never listened to my advice.

01:04:24.625 --> 01:04:26.916
Look at the disaster that's unfolded.

01:04:33.583 --> 01:04:34.416
Sir.

01:04:34.583 --> 01:04:37.166
Our journalist Ranganna has been murdered.

01:04:39.166 --> 01:04:40.458
It's Poojari, sir.

01:04:41.250 --> 01:04:43.250
But nobody can do anything.

01:04:55.625 --> 01:04:57.375
Brother, I'll take your leave.

01:05:01.166 --> 01:05:02.000
Hey, wait a minute.

01:05:03.333 --> 01:05:04.750
Wait till the rituals are done.

01:05:05.708 --> 01:05:06.541
I said come!

01:05:30.375 --> 01:05:33.833
-Hello.
-Sir, Bagheera killed your son Siddhi.

01:05:49.333 --> 01:05:51.000
Hey! Who did this?

01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:52.708
Who killed him?

01:05:53.041 --> 01:05:54.500
Hey! Did you see it?

01:05:55.625 --> 01:05:56.625
Did you see it?

01:05:56.708 --> 01:05:58.583
I saw it, sir!

01:06:08.416 --> 01:06:10.375
It was those dogs, sir!

01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:12.125
-What?
-Yes, sir!

01:06:12.750 --> 01:06:14.541
The boy is speaking the truth.
I saw it.

01:06:14.625 --> 01:06:16.833
-What are you barking?
-They were barking indeed, sir.

01:06:16.916 --> 01:06:18.708
I came out and saw…

01:06:18.791 --> 01:06:20.000
those same stray dogs.

01:06:20.291 --> 01:06:22.916
-They mauled him to death!
-Yes, sir.

01:06:23.041 --> 01:06:25.291
The municipality disregarded
our boss's repeated pleas.

01:06:25.375 --> 01:06:27.250
-Now look at what happened.
-Sir!

01:06:27.666 --> 01:06:29.583
One person yesterday. Two today.

01:06:29.666 --> 01:06:31.833
-It might be you tomorrow-- I mean…
-Hey!

01:06:31.958 --> 01:06:34.208
Please take care of those dogs, sir!

01:06:34.416 --> 01:06:37.000
If not, many more such lives will be lost.

01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:33.666
-Why did you come all the way brother?
-You're taking it all too lightly!

01:07:34.083 --> 01:07:36.625
-That's why I came.
-Nothing like that, brother.

01:07:36.875 --> 01:07:38.291
Why will I take it lightly?

01:07:38.416 --> 01:07:39.333
You know, right?

01:07:39.875 --> 01:07:41.583
You have three days left.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.125
Please trust me, brother.

01:07:43.208 --> 01:07:44.750
I'll definitely do it!

01:07:46.333 --> 01:07:48.750
It's better for you if you do.

01:07:49.791 --> 01:07:52.375
If not, this time…

01:07:52.583 --> 01:07:54.875
you know who will come to you, right?

01:07:57.708 --> 01:07:58.958
If he comes,

01:07:59.875 --> 01:08:02.458
you know what will happen then!

01:08:58.666 --> 01:09:01.625
Why do you make me
recite this prayer every day, Mom?

01:09:02.333 --> 01:09:03.791
If you recite this prayer,

01:09:03.916 --> 01:09:05.500
no matter what your troubles are,

01:09:05.583 --> 01:09:08.458
God will come and save you,
in some form or another!

01:09:08.541 --> 01:09:09.791
-Understood?
-Okay, Mom.

01:09:10.916 --> 01:09:12.333
-Bye!
-Bye!

01:09:20.625 --> 01:09:22.375
Mom!

01:09:23.416 --> 01:09:24.833
Sir, she's my daughter.

01:09:24.916 --> 01:09:27.458
She hasn't returned from school.

01:09:27.750 --> 01:09:29.166
Please find her.

01:09:35.166 --> 01:09:36.083
Sir.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.791
-Sir!
-What is all this?

01:09:44.875 --> 01:09:46.541
-It's all the missing cases, sir.
-So many?

01:09:46.625 --> 01:09:49.541
Yes, sir. Many people have
gone missing in the past two days.

01:09:49.958 --> 01:09:50.791
Wait.

01:09:51.375 --> 01:09:53.083
-Check with the other stations.
-Okay, sir.

01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:54.625
Give me your child's photo.

01:09:57.750 --> 01:10:00.500
There are a total of 87 complaints
across all the stations.

01:10:00.583 --> 01:10:01.500
-What?
-Yes, sir.

01:10:01.583 --> 01:10:03.666
The number of missing
complaints in the last three days

01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:06.250
exceed those that happened
in the last three months.

01:10:07.166 --> 01:10:08.500
-Get details of all the missing persons.
-Okay, sir.

01:10:08.583 --> 01:10:10.208
-Track all the numbers.
-Yes, sir.

01:10:10.291 --> 01:10:11.208
-Did you find anything?
-Sir…

01:10:11.291 --> 01:10:12.291
Here.

01:10:19.833 --> 01:10:21.916
Sir, all the numbers are switched off.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.166
But this number was
switched off ten minutes ago.

01:10:24.666 --> 01:10:26.083
This location is in a port area.

01:10:26.166 --> 01:10:28.041
It's Kotian's area.

01:10:28.375 --> 01:10:30.083
The police can't go there.

01:10:42.750 --> 01:10:44.291
-Get down quickly.
-Move!

01:12:19.291 --> 01:12:20.166
Vedanth?

01:12:21.833 --> 01:12:22.875
Vedanth.

01:12:58.375 --> 01:12:59.583
Were you searching for this?

01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:05.541
You need to rest.

01:13:09.791 --> 01:13:11.875
No. I have to go.

01:13:15.250 --> 01:13:16.250
Won't you ask me anything?

01:13:18.791 --> 01:13:22.041
If there was anything worth saying,
you would've said it.

01:13:59.958 --> 01:14:00.958
Come, Bagheera.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.666
There's no one to guard.

01:14:08.125 --> 01:14:10.250
Are you thinking about me
sitting here all alone?

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.666
What have you done?

01:14:18.875 --> 01:14:20.666
You entered a forbidden place.

01:14:21.166 --> 01:14:23.291
You witnessed things you shouldn't have.

01:14:24.250 --> 01:14:26.250
You did things that shouldn't
have been done.

01:14:26.750 --> 01:14:28.166
What's going on here?

01:14:28.416 --> 01:14:29.833
What are you doing?

01:14:30.125 --> 01:14:32.291
Why are you kidnapping so many people?

01:14:32.458 --> 01:14:35.375
What you've witnessed is just a glimpse.

01:14:37.541 --> 01:14:38.500
There's…

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.583
an ocean behind.

01:14:42.083 --> 01:14:46.125
The king of that ocean is Rana.

01:14:51.958 --> 01:14:55.250
We are petrified at the sight of monsters.

01:14:55.625 --> 01:14:59.791
Those monsters are terrified of him.

01:15:07.833 --> 01:15:09.000
Who is he?

01:15:10.125 --> 01:15:11.750
What will you do with the information?

01:15:14.375 --> 01:15:16.208
You can't do anything.

01:15:16.291 --> 01:15:17.583
What does he do?

01:15:18.333 --> 01:15:19.666
Organ trading.

01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:23.625
He has a network throughout India.

01:15:24.416 --> 01:15:27.041
He is a master orchestrator of crimes.

01:15:27.250 --> 01:15:29.750
No one can touch him.

01:15:45.375 --> 01:15:46.875
My wife, and my child.

01:15:47.958 --> 01:15:49.208
I killed them.

01:15:50.291 --> 01:15:53.625
Instead of pleading
for my life at his mercy…

01:15:54.416 --> 01:15:57.000
Boss, I made a mistake.

01:15:57.083 --> 01:15:58.875
Please forgive me one last time.

01:16:00.708 --> 01:16:03.583
If I let you go after making a mistake,

01:16:04.208 --> 01:16:05.916
won't I look weak?

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.083
Boss, he's been shot.

01:16:12.166 --> 01:16:13.291
He would've died.

01:16:13.375 --> 01:16:14.208
Please, Boss…

01:16:14.291 --> 01:16:16.541
-If I'm weak…
-Boss, please.

01:16:16.625 --> 01:16:19.750
how can I rule such a large kingdom?

01:16:21.583 --> 01:16:23.583
Look at how peacefully they're sleeping.

01:16:24.250 --> 01:16:27.958
No one should enter my kingdom.

01:16:28.041 --> 01:16:30.916
If they do, they shouldn't live.

01:16:32.083 --> 01:16:34.333
If he survives…

01:16:43.291 --> 01:16:45.916
-Boss!
-None of you should live.

01:16:50.458 --> 01:16:51.791
I can see it.

01:16:53.041 --> 01:16:54.791
I die today.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.708
And… you die tomorrow.

01:17:01.250 --> 01:17:02.166
Hey!

01:18:14.875 --> 01:18:17.083
He was more of a son to you than me.

01:18:17.166 --> 01:18:18.791
You light the pyre.

01:18:19.791 --> 01:18:22.041
The day you kill Bagheera…

01:18:25.416 --> 01:18:26.333
that day,

01:18:26.583 --> 01:18:28.500
I'll light his pyre.

01:20:21.541 --> 01:20:22.416
Oh, no…

01:20:32.333 --> 01:20:33.291
Bagheera.

01:20:35.458 --> 01:20:37.833
He brought the entire department
to its knees.

01:20:39.541 --> 01:20:42.625
Is Bagheera on his own
or part of a gang, sir?

01:20:43.041 --> 01:20:46.708
Given how many people he's killed,
he must be part of a gang.

01:20:47.875 --> 01:20:49.291
I sense he's on his own.

01:20:49.375 --> 01:20:50.291
How can you be sure, sir?

01:20:50.375 --> 01:20:51.583
If it was a gang,

01:20:51.666 --> 01:20:54.333
they could have attacked
four or five places at a time.

01:20:54.416 --> 01:20:55.583
He attacked only one place.

01:20:55.833 --> 01:20:57.500
There's a greater chance that he's alone.

01:20:58.541 --> 01:21:02.166
If he's killing rowdies, dons,
and criminals,

01:21:02.250 --> 01:21:05.125
he wants to be
the king of the underworld.

01:21:05.458 --> 01:21:07.208
People from the underworld
often exhibit arrogance.

01:21:07.291 --> 01:21:08.875
People should know our work.

01:21:08.958 --> 01:21:10.750
They want to create fear
in people's minds.

01:21:10.833 --> 01:21:11.875
Can you see that here?

01:21:12.208 --> 01:21:16.416
Given the brutality of his killings,
he's likely a serial killer.

01:21:16.583 --> 01:21:18.458
Serial killing is a mental ailment.

01:21:18.541 --> 01:21:19.458
There's a pattern to it.

01:21:19.541 --> 01:21:21.166
I don't see that pattern here.

01:21:21.416 --> 01:21:25.666
What if a victim's family member
sought revenge on these criminals?

01:21:25.916 --> 01:21:27.708
Revenge. You have a point there.

01:21:27.875 --> 01:21:30.875
If it were revenge, he should've only
killed those who wronged him.

01:21:30.958 --> 01:21:32.291
Why did he kill so many people?

01:21:32.375 --> 01:21:35.416
He doesn't want others to suffer
the same injustice he experienced.

01:21:36.125 --> 01:21:40.375
Make a list of people who were assaulted
and killed by Bagheera.

01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:42.416
I want the details of all these people.

01:21:42.833 --> 01:21:46.291
Keep all the political, criminal,
and other cases on standby.

01:21:46.416 --> 01:21:48.583
Your focus should be
one and only Bagheera.

01:21:49.208 --> 01:21:52.458
Because I want him dead
or alive at any cost.

01:21:52.791 --> 01:21:54.375
-Did you get it?
-Yes, sir.

01:22:01.916 --> 01:22:04.000
Sir, just a minute.

01:22:05.083 --> 01:22:07.083
Bagheera is killing criminals, sir.

01:22:07.416 --> 01:22:08.625
He's doing our job.

01:22:09.250 --> 01:22:11.125
-Why should we catch him?
-What's your name?

01:22:11.583 --> 01:22:13.625
Narayan. South station.

01:22:13.791 --> 01:22:15.875
The department sent me to assist you.

01:22:16.041 --> 01:22:19.416
Even if a godlike person goes to
the temple, he can't perform the rituals.

01:22:19.750 --> 01:22:21.041
The priest has to do it.

01:22:21.291 --> 01:22:23.041
People should handle their own tasks.

01:22:23.666 --> 01:22:26.083
What were you doing as a cop
while all this was happening?

01:22:26.291 --> 01:22:28.833
When we came to know about it
and reached there,

01:22:28.916 --> 01:22:30.500
he would've killed everyone and left.

01:22:30.583 --> 01:22:32.833
Looking at your size and speed,

01:22:33.166 --> 01:22:35.333
he would've had a nice meal,
slept for half an hour, and left!

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.708
-Sir.
-Nonsense.

01:22:50.416 --> 01:22:51.333
Rana!

01:23:20.708 --> 01:23:23.041
His network spans across India.

01:23:44.791 --> 01:23:47.916
Rather than getting caught by him and
begging for the mercy of death…

01:24:23.166 --> 01:24:24.041
Sir.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.041
-Sir.
-Tell me.

01:24:26.125 --> 01:24:28.541
I need to report for duty with the CBI.

01:24:28.625 --> 01:24:29.500
CBI?

01:24:29.791 --> 01:24:30.666
Why?

01:24:30.833 --> 01:24:32.041
To catch Bagheera.

01:24:36.625 --> 01:24:38.750
There's a hacker, sir.

01:24:42.083 --> 01:24:43.208
He's a cunning fellow.

01:24:43.583 --> 01:24:46.000
He's an expert hacker.

01:24:46.333 --> 01:24:48.375
Bank accounts, company data,

01:24:48.458 --> 01:24:49.375
not just that,

01:24:49.916 --> 01:24:52.708
he hacked the police department website.

01:24:53.541 --> 01:24:57.958
Sir… we got this from him.

01:24:58.041 --> 01:24:59.666
Don't catch him, sir.

01:25:19.416 --> 01:25:20.958
Why should I work for you?

01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:23.708
I haven't worked for anyone before.

01:25:23.916 --> 01:25:26.041
What will I gain from this?

01:25:31.375 --> 01:25:35.166
If I spend just ten minutes on a system,
I'd earn more than this.

01:25:47.791 --> 01:25:49.583
I know you're Bagheera.

01:25:49.916 --> 01:25:51.125
What if I reveal it to the world?

01:25:52.166 --> 01:25:56.208
Having killed so many people,
killing one more person isn't a big thing.

01:25:57.875 --> 01:25:59.041
What should I do?

01:26:02.083 --> 01:26:03.708
Prepare me.

01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:31.208
Narayan, stay back
and inquire about Bagheera.

01:26:31.291 --> 01:26:32.166
Okay, sir.

01:26:32.250 --> 01:26:35.250
If we had Narayan with us,
he would've shown us around.

01:26:35.333 --> 01:26:38.458
He's from the police department.
He'll have some knowledge about Bagheera.

01:26:38.541 --> 01:26:41.583
Police only show us
what they want us to see.

01:26:41.666 --> 01:26:43.500
They don't observe the things we do.

01:26:45.958 --> 01:26:47.500
We talked to the residents
throughout the entire locale.

01:26:47.625 --> 01:26:49.333
No one is ready to share information.

01:26:50.500 --> 01:26:52.416
All those killed were notorious criminals.

01:26:52.708 --> 01:26:54.583
When we inquire about the killer,

01:26:54.791 --> 01:26:56.541
people see us as criminals.

01:26:56.833 --> 01:26:59.958
We didn't get any useful information.

01:27:01.458 --> 01:27:02.333
Let's go.

01:27:09.583 --> 01:27:11.375
-Keep walking!
-Sir.

01:27:11.791 --> 01:27:12.625
Why are you pushing him?

01:27:12.708 --> 01:27:15.166
He gives an electric shock
to everyone at school, sir.

01:27:15.250 --> 01:27:16.083
What? Current shock?!

01:27:16.166 --> 01:27:17.625
Yes, sir.
We get a shock with a mere touch.

01:27:17.708 --> 01:27:20.166
He looks so cute. Will he do such a thing?

01:27:20.291 --> 01:27:21.125
Is it true?

01:27:26.583 --> 01:27:28.125
Why are you giving a shock to everyone?

01:27:28.208 --> 01:27:30.250
Sir, it doesn't affect me.

01:27:30.333 --> 01:27:32.500
I told them I could pass the current
through my body.

01:27:32.708 --> 01:27:34.000
No one believed me, sir.

01:27:34.208 --> 01:27:36.666
That's why I demonstrated it to them.

01:27:36.833 --> 01:27:38.750
How did you do it?

01:27:39.375 --> 01:27:40.250
Sir,

01:27:40.333 --> 01:27:45.958
I connected 9.5 volt Lithium battery
to a booster generator.

01:27:46.041 --> 01:27:50.875
I connected a wire to the insulator
point on my hand.

01:27:50.958 --> 01:27:53.500
-DC power is generated--
-Stop it.

01:27:53.958 --> 01:27:56.625
Can we scale this up?

01:27:56.958 --> 01:27:58.750
We can do it, sir.

01:27:58.833 --> 01:28:01.625
Nine or ten volts are not sufficient.

01:28:01.708 --> 01:28:03.375
We need high voltage.

01:28:03.541 --> 01:28:06.625
We only need
premium-quality latex material.

01:28:06.708 --> 01:28:09.583
I need a lab to set all this up.

01:28:09.875 --> 01:28:12.916
What's this, sir? You're seeking
help from school kids.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.833
We'll find experts on the dark web.

01:28:16.666 --> 01:28:18.958
What? Why are you staring at me like that?

01:28:19.041 --> 01:28:21.583
This is not your regular science
experiment at school.

01:28:21.875 --> 01:28:22.708
You!

01:28:29.541 --> 01:28:32.000
-We need justice!
-As you can see viewers,

01:28:32.083 --> 01:28:34.666
people are protesting against the police.

01:28:53.875 --> 01:28:56.875
Take my complaint, sir.

01:28:56.958 --> 01:28:57.791
Go over there.

01:28:57.875 --> 01:28:59.375
-Govinda.
-Brother.

01:28:59.750 --> 01:29:00.625
What's going on?

01:29:01.166 --> 01:29:05.250
I was working in a fireworks factory, sir.

01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:07.625
They fired me.

01:29:07.708 --> 01:29:11.083
-Why?
-I drink alcohol and report to duty.

01:29:11.166 --> 01:29:13.041
If you drink and go to the office,

01:29:13.125 --> 01:29:15.833
will they make you the chairman
instead of firing you?

01:29:15.916 --> 01:29:16.833
Bloody drunkard!

01:29:16.916 --> 01:29:20.916
Don't insult me for being an alcoholic.

01:29:21.625 --> 01:29:23.500
I'm a creator.

01:29:23.583 --> 01:29:27.916
Scientist. Fireworks Scientist.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.416
-You're a fireworks scientist?!
-Scientist!

01:29:39.083 --> 01:29:41.583
-Are you a scientist?!
-Sir!

01:29:42.375 --> 01:29:45.458
You don't know what I'm capable of.

01:29:45.541 --> 01:29:47.666
If you want an atom bomb…

01:29:49.083 --> 01:29:49.916
I can make it.

01:29:50.375 --> 01:29:53.625
What sized bomb do you need
to destroy this station?

01:30:02.458 --> 01:30:04.166
-Give me a liver fry.
-Okay, sir.

01:30:04.250 --> 01:30:06.000
-What do you want?
-I won't eat liver.

01:30:06.083 --> 01:30:06.958
Hey!

01:30:07.291 --> 01:30:08.833
Your liver will be damaged
with alcohol, right?

01:30:09.041 --> 01:30:11.000
If you eat liver while drinking,
your liver will be safe.

01:30:11.833 --> 01:30:13.958
-Will you eat chicken?
-Vegetarian, sir.

01:30:14.916 --> 01:30:16.416
-Get one gobi manchurian.
-Okay, sir.

01:30:20.625 --> 01:30:21.791
-What's going on?
-Brother.

01:30:22.458 --> 01:30:23.416
-Are you good?
-Yes.

01:30:23.500 --> 01:30:25.125
-Pack the liver fry.
-Sir.

01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:29.416
Who the hell are you? Let me go.

01:30:29.791 --> 01:30:31.041
Who are you?

01:30:31.916 --> 01:30:33.291
You rascal!

01:30:33.875 --> 01:30:35.750
Both of you threw acid on the girl.

01:30:36.291 --> 01:30:38.500
Bagheera attacked him but spared you.

01:30:38.958 --> 01:30:42.083
I don't know anything, sir.

01:30:42.166 --> 01:30:44.916
He threw acid on her. I was with him.

01:30:45.041 --> 01:30:48.208
Let me go. I'm innocent.

01:30:48.291 --> 01:30:51.416
Please leave me. I haven't done anything.

01:30:51.541 --> 01:30:53.875
-Please let me go--
-Take the parcel.

01:31:07.250 --> 01:31:08.083
Sir!

01:31:08.166 --> 01:31:13.333
If this explodes when
I'm making it, will I be here?

01:31:13.541 --> 01:31:14.666
Come.

01:31:31.125 --> 01:31:34.041
Don't linger nearby
once it's all over.

01:31:34.125 --> 01:31:36.500
It could explode at any time.

01:31:36.583 --> 01:31:37.583
You!

01:31:57.791 --> 01:31:58.666
No, sir.

01:31:58.875 --> 01:32:02.875
Why use kalari when we have
high-end weapons at our disposal?

01:32:12.416 --> 01:32:14.666
Daydream and I'm thinking about you

01:32:14.750 --> 01:32:17.375
What you say, queen?
I'm not linking without you

01:32:17.541 --> 01:32:20.541
I'll pick you up at eight
It's not a date, it's a way!

01:32:20.625 --> 01:32:23.583
I'll pick you up at eight
It's not a date, it's a way!

01:32:36.291 --> 01:32:38.208
-What are you doing in this department?

01:32:39.291 --> 01:32:40.333
In your city,

01:32:40.750 --> 01:32:43.083
one person is creating havoc
and has killed many people.

01:32:43.208 --> 01:32:44.541
You're relaxing in the station.

01:32:45.250 --> 01:32:46.791
Do you know how much
they're investing in you?

01:32:46.875 --> 01:32:50.250
Academies, training centers,
such a big force. Why?

01:32:50.958 --> 01:32:52.583
Have you heard of Scotland Yard?

01:32:52.666 --> 01:32:53.791
Is it in Scotland?

01:32:54.791 --> 01:32:56.041
It's in your backyard.

01:32:56.666 --> 01:32:59.083
England's police department
is known as Scotland Yard.

01:32:59.208 --> 01:33:00.666
Have you heard about the Canadian police?

01:33:01.041 --> 01:33:02.958
French police, Italian police?

01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:06.625
They'll solve the crime
within a few hours.

01:33:07.583 --> 01:33:08.791
Learn. Understand.

01:33:08.875 --> 01:33:10.750
-Sir--
-What?

01:33:11.083 --> 01:33:13.000
You'll have a thousand excuses ready.

01:33:13.083 --> 01:33:14.166
Sir, we tried our best.

01:33:14.250 --> 01:33:16.166
He escaped. Give us another chance.

01:33:17.250 --> 01:33:20.291
Some ethical responsibility.
Some accountability.

01:33:20.375 --> 01:33:22.458
-Some moral responsibility.
-Sir.

01:33:23.541 --> 01:33:25.291
-Can I leave?
-What?

01:33:26.625 --> 01:33:27.458
Can I leave?

01:33:27.833 --> 01:33:29.875
I don't have time to
listen to morals and ethics.

01:33:30.458 --> 01:33:31.625
I'll meet you when I'm free.

01:33:32.208 --> 01:33:34.375
-Let's talk then.
-What's keeping you busy?

01:33:34.458 --> 01:33:35.625
I've booked a new car.

01:33:36.041 --> 01:33:37.000
Today is the delivery date.

01:33:37.666 --> 01:33:38.541
New car?

01:33:39.750 --> 01:33:40.666
Mr. Vedanth.

01:33:41.375 --> 01:33:42.541
I've heard a lot about you.

01:33:43.708 --> 01:33:44.833
You're very famous.

01:33:44.916 --> 01:33:45.916
For the wrong reasons.

01:33:46.333 --> 01:33:49.791
Are you here to catch Bagheera
or to inquire about me?

01:33:50.166 --> 01:33:52.000
That time will come too.

01:33:52.833 --> 01:33:55.250
Then, everyone will know about you.

01:33:55.708 --> 01:33:59.041
If you want to know who I am,
change how you see me.

01:33:59.375 --> 01:34:02.291
You handle your work,
and I'll handle mine.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:04.875
Thank you, sir.

01:34:10.041 --> 01:34:11.541
They got me here to capture Bagheera.

01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:13.625
They should've hired me
to apprehend such a corrupt officer.

01:34:14.291 --> 01:34:17.166
The system is at fault.

01:34:17.916 --> 01:34:19.250
All of you can leave. Please.

01:34:28.208 --> 01:34:30.833
Sneha, what are you doing here?

01:34:31.791 --> 01:34:32.791
Don't talk too much.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.125
Freshen up. I'll tell you everything.

01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:37.875
Dad!

01:34:37.958 --> 01:34:40.666
He went to watch a late-night movie.
There's no one at home.

01:34:40.791 --> 01:34:41.958
Only you and me.

01:34:42.083 --> 01:34:43.833
Hey! Have you gone mad?

01:34:44.666 --> 01:34:46.208
Knowing everything, why are you
acting like this?

01:34:46.583 --> 01:34:48.583
I'm crazy. So what?

01:34:50.208 --> 01:34:52.166
The atmosphere is so romantic.

01:34:52.458 --> 01:34:53.541
Don't ruin it.

01:34:53.791 --> 01:34:55.041
First, get out of here.

01:34:55.375 --> 01:34:56.875
Will you listen to me or not?

01:35:00.625 --> 01:35:02.166
Won't you understand
if I tell you in a nicer way?

01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:03.375
Please leave.

01:35:11.125 --> 01:35:12.958
Sneha, what are you doing?

01:35:13.875 --> 01:35:14.791
Let me go, Sneha.

01:35:18.125 --> 01:35:20.041
Listen to me, Sneha.

01:35:20.708 --> 01:35:21.958
Why are you doing this?

01:35:22.208 --> 01:35:23.333
Sneha, please.

01:35:24.708 --> 01:35:27.333
I'm telling you this for your own good.
Please, Sneha.

01:35:36.750 --> 01:35:38.083
Go up.

01:35:38.458 --> 01:35:39.375
Go up now!

01:35:39.458 --> 01:35:41.000
Hey, move!

01:35:41.083 --> 01:35:42.166
Hello, brother.

01:35:42.250 --> 01:35:45.875
The Azerbaijan party wants
a consignment of 2000 people.

01:35:45.958 --> 01:35:47.625
They need it delivered immediately.

01:35:47.708 --> 01:35:49.750
We'll finalize everything
if you're here.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.416
Will you come? Brother?

01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:53.333
Yes, I'll come.

01:35:53.708 --> 01:35:58.291
If we successfully deliver on this deal,
that client will be ours forever.

01:35:58.958 --> 01:36:02.541
We just have to deliver the consignment
to the Rameswaram port.

01:36:02.916 --> 01:36:04.666
They'll handle the rest themselves.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:13.541
Did you find anything in Kotian's phone?

01:36:14.375 --> 01:36:15.625
Nothing significant.

01:36:15.916 --> 01:36:17.166
There are personal details.

01:36:17.416 --> 01:36:20.333
Mobile bills, bank accounts,
and properties.

01:36:20.708 --> 01:36:23.291
Mangaluru, Kundapura, Uppala.

01:36:23.708 --> 01:36:26.125
In Uppala? Check the exact spot in Uppala.

01:36:31.916 --> 01:36:33.500
This is a slum.

01:36:33.875 --> 01:36:35.541
Why will he take a place in this slum?

01:36:35.625 --> 01:36:36.458
Right!

01:36:36.708 --> 01:36:38.833
Akash, check if you can
find something useful.

01:36:42.791 --> 01:36:43.958
I'm checking, sir.

01:36:44.583 --> 01:36:46.041
There are only electric bills.

01:36:47.083 --> 01:36:49.041
Sir, take a look. What's this?

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:51.833
Forty thousand, thirty-seven thousand.

01:36:51.916 --> 01:36:53.375
There's a bill of 60,000 too.

01:36:53.875 --> 01:36:57.416
It suggests some other
activities happening there.

01:37:17.041 --> 01:37:18.458
Hey! Move it!

01:39:33.750 --> 01:39:36.041
Don't hit me, sir.

01:39:36.500 --> 01:39:37.416
What should I do, sir?

01:39:37.541 --> 01:39:40.125
There was no other way
to save my father.

01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:44.000
Please, sir. Let me go.

01:39:45.958 --> 01:39:48.625
To protect a 75-year-old man,

01:39:49.291 --> 01:39:52.541
is it right to kill a 15-year-old girl?

01:39:52.708 --> 01:39:55.083
Please forgive me. Let me go.

01:40:05.958 --> 01:40:08.958
Hello. CB7 News. Who's talking?

01:40:09.333 --> 01:40:10.458
Who's talking?

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:11.875
Hello.

01:40:12.125 --> 01:40:13.583
We're coming live from Uppala.

01:40:13.666 --> 01:40:15.583
The border of Karnataka and Kerala.

01:40:15.666 --> 01:40:17.625
It's a mayhem created by Bagheera.

01:40:17.750 --> 01:40:19.458
Is he a maniac or a messiah?

01:40:19.541 --> 01:40:21.291
Is he a savior or a destroyer?

01:40:21.375 --> 01:40:22.916
It's left for people to decide.

01:40:23.166 --> 01:40:25.291
The very disturbing visuals
coming your way…

01:40:25.375 --> 01:40:27.791
exclusively on CB7 news.

01:40:30.916 --> 01:40:31.833
Sir.

01:40:35.583 --> 01:40:36.750
-Gopal.
-Sir?

01:40:36.833 --> 01:40:39.583
Why are people saying
the country hasn't progressed?

01:40:40.458 --> 01:40:43.041
A super specialty hospital in a slum.

01:40:43.375 --> 01:40:44.625
It's developed a lot.

01:40:45.125 --> 01:40:46.416
People are not aware of it.

01:40:50.875 --> 01:40:51.708
Hello.

01:40:51.791 --> 01:40:56.166
Boss, Bagheera has destroyed
our place in Uppala.

01:41:01.958 --> 01:41:03.166
Who saved you?

01:41:03.958 --> 01:41:04.833
What did he look like?

01:41:06.875 --> 01:41:09.291
This is the Kerala border.

01:41:09.458 --> 01:41:12.083
-They won't speak Kannada in Bengaluru.
-True, sir.

01:41:12.166 --> 01:41:14.583
Who's that?
Did anyone see him?

01:41:16.625 --> 01:41:18.750
-Which language should I speak?
-Sir…

01:41:19.333 --> 01:41:21.458
I don't understand
what you're saying, sir.

01:41:21.541 --> 01:41:23.125
Oh! You guys speak Hindi?

01:41:23.375 --> 01:41:25.250
-Where are you from?
-Haryana, sir.

01:41:25.333 --> 01:41:27.166
-Did you come here for work?
-No, sir.

01:41:27.583 --> 01:41:29.375
They kidnapped me in Haryana.

01:41:29.958 --> 01:41:31.791
-Kidnapped in Haryana?
-Yes, sir.

01:41:32.166 --> 01:41:33.708
-Where are you from?
-Kolkata, sir.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:34.833
Odisha.

01:41:34.916 --> 01:41:35.833
Nagaland.

01:41:36.041 --> 01:41:38.958
-You guys are not from here?
-No, sir.

01:41:40.333 --> 01:41:41.875
Who kidnapped all of you?

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:43.208
We don't know, sir.

01:41:43.875 --> 01:41:45.958
How did they get you here?

01:41:46.333 --> 01:41:47.625
We don't know.

01:41:48.375 --> 01:41:49.875
Who saved you?

01:41:50.416 --> 01:41:51.583
We don't know.

01:41:52.750 --> 01:41:55.125
Did one guy save you, or were there many?

01:41:55.916 --> 01:41:56.958
You don't know that as well?

01:41:58.791 --> 01:42:00.208
-Is anybody alive?
-No, sir.

01:42:00.625 --> 01:42:01.750
You guys are not blind!

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.750
At least, describe what he looked like.

01:42:12.458 --> 01:42:14.083
He looked dangerous, sir.

01:42:20.250 --> 01:42:23.833
We were able to trace multiple locations
using this hard drive.

01:42:24.416 --> 01:42:26.541
Large sums were sent
to all these locations.

01:42:27.166 --> 01:42:29.875
All transactions were carried out by
small financial societies.

01:42:30.083 --> 01:42:32.666
It's difficult for the government
to track this.

01:42:34.291 --> 01:42:37.333
Most transactions
are under one guy's name.

01:42:37.791 --> 01:42:38.666
Who's he?

01:42:40.625 --> 01:42:41.541
Yogi.

01:42:42.875 --> 01:42:43.875
Show me his details.

01:42:46.333 --> 01:42:47.833
There are no details.

01:42:48.625 --> 01:42:50.916
Facebook and Instagram are not active.

01:42:51.458 --> 01:42:53.000
We found a phone number.

01:42:53.291 --> 01:42:54.416
-Call him.
-Sure.

01:42:55.625 --> 01:42:58.416
The number you're calling
is either switched off

01:42:58.500 --> 01:43:00.541
-or not reachable at the moment.
-The phone is switched off.

01:43:00.750 --> 01:43:04.583
List all the locations
with high power consumption.

01:43:09.833 --> 01:43:12.250
We have identified several locations.

01:43:12.541 --> 01:43:14.333
Visiting these locations is highly risky.

01:43:15.166 --> 01:43:16.541
Think again.

01:43:37.166 --> 01:43:39.500
The battleground trembles
At his war cry

01:43:39.583 --> 01:43:41.791
Quicker than an arrow
He's a comet!

01:43:41.875 --> 01:43:44.083
The burning sky rumbles at his speed

01:43:44.166 --> 01:43:46.416
He's an exploding comet!

01:43:46.500 --> 01:43:48.750
The battleground trembles
At his war cry

01:43:48.833 --> 01:43:51.000
Quicker than an arrow
He's a comet!

01:43:51.083 --> 01:43:53.416
The burning sky rumbles at his speed

01:43:53.500 --> 01:43:55.583
He's an exploding comet!

01:43:55.666 --> 01:44:00.208
He's here to crush all the villains
Make them bleed

01:44:00.333 --> 01:44:02.625
He's a worthy opponent

01:44:02.708 --> 01:44:04.750
Takes everyone by storm

01:44:04.833 --> 01:44:07.875
Once he aims…

01:44:08.375 --> 01:44:10.041
Lock, load, fire!

01:44:10.416 --> 01:44:12.625
Better run, run, run!

01:44:12.708 --> 01:44:15.000
He's got a gun, gun, gun!

01:44:15.083 --> 01:44:17.375
Better run, run, run!

01:44:17.458 --> 01:44:19.291
He's got a gun, gun, gun!

01:44:19.666 --> 01:44:21.916
Better run, run, run!

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.250
He's got a gun, gun, gun!

01:44:24.333 --> 01:44:26.541
Better run, run, run!

01:44:26.625 --> 01:44:28.541
He's got a gun, gun, gun!

01:44:34.750 --> 01:44:37.208
Bagheera is rising in popularity, sir.

01:44:37.291 --> 01:44:39.833
It's just social media hype
and a few people talking.

01:44:41.166 --> 01:44:43.000
Upgrade defence for my randall

01:44:43.458 --> 01:44:45.375
Triumphing handle in the saddle

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:47.666
Thrash you, grinding my Prada

01:44:48.166 --> 01:44:50.375
Yo, I'm the mad raging monster

01:44:50.458 --> 01:44:52.791
Always first to the finish line!

01:44:52.875 --> 01:44:54.416
Appears to play when it's dawn

01:44:54.500 --> 01:44:56.291
Has the pick of the jungle

01:44:56.375 --> 01:44:59.041
And only one predator
Roars for justice!

01:44:59.125 --> 01:45:00.625
Moves with the speed of a panther

01:45:00.791 --> 01:45:02.958
Always catches his prey
He's a born hunter!

01:45:03.041 --> 01:45:07.875
He's a born hunter!

01:45:07.958 --> 01:45:09.875
Remember where you are
When you pursue him

01:45:10.041 --> 01:45:12.208
He'll bury you on the spot

01:45:12.333 --> 01:45:17.250
He's a brave warrior!

01:45:17.666 --> 01:45:19.916
He's not a wave or a whirlpool

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.166
He's a roaring tsunami!

01:45:22.291 --> 01:45:24.500
He's not easily forgiving
Won't budge an inch

01:45:24.583 --> 01:45:26.791
He's a scorching desert!

01:45:26.875 --> 01:45:29.708
Face him if you dare!

01:45:30.291 --> 01:45:32.000
Lock, load, fire!

01:45:32.375 --> 01:45:34.583
Better run, run, run!

01:45:34.666 --> 01:45:36.916
He's got a gun, gun, gun!

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.291
Better run, run, run!

01:45:39.375 --> 01:45:41.166
He's got a gun, gun, gun!

01:45:41.583 --> 01:45:43.875
Better run, run, run!

01:45:43.958 --> 01:45:46.083
He's got a gun, gun, gun!

01:45:46.166 --> 01:45:48.500
Better run, run, run!

01:45:48.583 --> 01:45:50.458
He's got a gun, gun, gun!

01:45:52.583 --> 01:45:53.500
Give me a tea.

01:45:54.625 --> 01:45:56.916
Wow, dude, look at how
Bagheera has blasted these guys!

01:45:57.041 --> 01:45:59.000
I wonder who supplies bombs to him!

01:46:05.250 --> 01:46:06.500
-Boss.
-Bagheera.

01:46:22.333 --> 01:46:23.166
Oh no!

01:46:25.375 --> 01:46:26.791
-Sir.
-What are you doing?

01:46:27.458 --> 01:46:28.458
My son is already dead,

01:46:28.750 --> 01:46:29.916
are you waiting for my death as well?

01:46:30.250 --> 01:46:31.083
Sir, I'm getting there.

01:46:31.166 --> 01:46:32.041
I need a bit more time.

01:46:32.125 --> 01:46:34.041
It's not just my son who is dead,

01:46:35.166 --> 01:46:36.916
he was more like a son to you as well.
Don't forget that.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:38.291
I know that, sir. I know that.

01:46:38.375 --> 01:46:39.833
Believe me, I'm on it, sir.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:42.125
I don't think so, Guru.

01:46:42.625 --> 01:46:43.458
I don't think so.

01:46:44.125 --> 01:46:45.833
I'm losing faith in you.

01:46:46.708 --> 01:46:47.541
Shit!

01:46:48.625 --> 01:46:49.791
Bagheera!

01:46:50.041 --> 01:46:51.625
Bagheera!

01:46:52.083 --> 01:46:53.291
This Bagheera mask costs
a hundred rupees, sir.

01:46:53.791 --> 01:46:55.750
Please buy one, sir.

01:46:55.875 --> 01:46:57.916
-Hey! Who's that Bagheera?!
-How many do you want sir?

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
-Sir!
-Bagheera it seems!

01:47:00.083 --> 01:47:02.916
-Sir, please let him go.
-Sir, I will give it to you for free.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:04.625
-Bagheera it seems!
-Sir…

01:47:04.708 --> 01:47:05.750
Let him go.

01:47:05.833 --> 01:47:07.375
Sir, please let him go.
People are watching you.

01:47:07.458 --> 01:47:08.583
-Just go!
-Leave.

01:47:19.375 --> 01:47:22.291
-No, sir, this is on 19th September--
-Wait. These are the events.

01:47:22.375 --> 01:47:23.916
-Yes.
-Check all the footage.

01:47:24.791 --> 01:47:25.625
And their…

01:47:26.500 --> 01:47:27.375
Freeze. Freeze!

01:47:27.708 --> 01:47:28.666
Yeah, there! There! There!

01:47:29.166 --> 01:47:30.625
Zoom in to that poster.

01:47:31.208 --> 01:47:32.083
Stop!

01:47:32.541 --> 01:47:35.541
Guys, can you see something here?

01:47:35.708 --> 01:47:38.083
-What is it, sir?
-Just look at the posture.

01:47:38.375 --> 01:47:39.625
Look at how he's holding the gun.

01:47:40.250 --> 01:47:41.958
He's not a normal person at all.

01:47:42.041 --> 01:47:44.375
He must be
a trained professional assassin.

01:47:44.666 --> 01:47:46.000
Trained professional meaning?

01:47:46.083 --> 01:47:47.083
Trained in the army,

01:47:47.583 --> 01:47:48.708
black cat commandos,

01:47:48.791 --> 01:47:51.625
navy seals, or even the special training
in the police department.

01:47:55.708 --> 01:47:56.666
And he--

01:47:57.625 --> 01:47:58.916
-Narayan.
-Sir.

01:47:59.125 --> 01:48:00.791
You please leave.
I will let you know if there's any work.

01:48:01.125 --> 01:48:02.000
Yes, sir.

01:48:04.791 --> 01:48:06.583
-Where is the file?
-It's on your table, sir.

01:48:07.125 --> 01:48:08.875
We're going in the wrong direction.

01:48:11.208 --> 01:48:14.416
We're investigating
the criminals killed by Bagheera.

01:48:14.666 --> 01:48:18.125
We should be asking questions
to the people who got justice instead.

01:48:18.291 --> 01:48:19.916
I'm sure we'll get something there.

01:48:21.291 --> 01:48:24.250
Open all the files on those dead criminals

01:48:24.541 --> 01:48:27.666
and the complaints registered
against them by their victims.

01:48:28.166 --> 01:48:30.583
Open them fast! Central, north,
east, everything, get on the job!

01:48:43.250 --> 01:48:44.166
Hey!

01:48:45.166 --> 01:48:46.000
Get lost!

01:48:53.041 --> 01:48:53.875
Sir…

01:48:55.791 --> 01:48:57.416
MANGALURU SOUTH SUB DIVISION PS

01:49:21.458 --> 01:49:23.083
Sir, these are the complaints, sir.

01:49:24.541 --> 01:49:25.458
How many are there in here?

01:49:25.541 --> 01:49:26.916
Overall fourteen complaints, sir.

01:49:27.333 --> 01:49:28.666
There are six complaints
in the Central station.

01:49:29.208 --> 01:49:30.583
There are four in the North.

01:49:30.875 --> 01:49:32.333
And two each in the East and the West.

01:49:32.958 --> 01:49:34.666
There are no complaints against them
at all in the South.

01:49:58.375 --> 01:50:00.375
Boss, please forgive me.

01:50:00.708 --> 01:50:01.708
There's no mistake of mine.

01:50:01.958 --> 01:50:03.541
I'm unable to make out who he is.

01:50:04.166 --> 01:50:06.500
Please don't kill me. Please, Boss.

01:50:07.500 --> 01:50:08.500
Boss!

01:50:09.708 --> 01:50:10.708
Get up.

01:50:14.208 --> 01:50:15.916
I won't kill you.

01:50:19.291 --> 01:50:20.916
You are a good worker.

01:50:21.458 --> 01:50:23.833
Until I find someone
who can surpass you at work,

01:50:25.625 --> 01:50:26.500
you're safe.

01:50:28.416 --> 01:50:30.666
I will handle Bagheera.

01:50:31.875 --> 01:50:34.083
The five thousand people consignment

01:50:34.625 --> 01:50:37.083
should reach Sri Lanka immediately.

01:50:37.458 --> 01:50:39.416
You handle that.

01:50:39.875 --> 01:50:43.041
Get in touch
with all our dealers in India.

01:50:43.333 --> 01:50:44.625
Okay, Boss.

01:50:46.083 --> 01:50:46.958
Thanks, Boss.

01:50:49.250 --> 01:50:50.250
By the way,

01:50:51.375 --> 01:50:54.041
why did Bagheera spare you anyway?

01:50:54.333 --> 01:50:56.416
He should've killed you first.

01:50:57.208 --> 01:50:59.750
I went underground
the day we got attacked.

01:51:00.166 --> 01:51:02.000
I switched off my phone and laid low.

01:51:02.500 --> 01:51:05.041
Oh, that's how.

01:51:05.791 --> 01:51:06.708
Turn on your phone.

01:51:07.416 --> 01:51:08.333
Boss?

01:51:10.708 --> 01:51:12.500
Turn on the phone.

01:51:18.500 --> 01:51:20.375
Yogi's phone has turned on, sir.

01:51:23.875 --> 01:51:25.166
Sir, his location.

01:52:27.500 --> 01:52:29.125
Bagheera!

01:52:29.666 --> 01:52:31.833
You look great!

01:52:33.041 --> 01:52:35.708
The spirit of death radiates your face.

01:52:36.208 --> 01:52:38.708
Do you think you're some kind of hero?

01:52:39.083 --> 01:52:40.750
You're a villain.

01:52:40.833 --> 01:52:42.791
I'm the hero here.

01:52:42.958 --> 01:52:45.333
The day villains start
to see themselves as heroes,

01:52:46.083 --> 01:52:48.083
heroes will also become
as ruthless as the villains.

01:52:48.583 --> 01:52:49.541
By the way,

01:52:49.666 --> 01:52:51.583
why are you getting in my way?

01:52:51.750 --> 01:52:55.583
I'm providing eyes to the blind
and kidneys to those in need.

01:52:56.083 --> 01:52:59.708
I'm saving four lives by taking one.

01:52:59.833 --> 01:53:04.291
Do you think you're God,
taking one life to save another?

01:53:04.500 --> 01:53:08.750
That's right!
I take a life to save another,

01:53:10.250 --> 01:53:11.833
I must be God!

01:53:11.916 --> 01:53:13.541
Cling to your delusion of godhood

01:53:14.041 --> 01:53:15.875
until the day dawns
when you must confront your maker.

01:53:16.875 --> 01:53:19.708
So, you want to kill me too?

01:53:20.291 --> 01:53:22.583
Do you think you came here by yourself?

01:53:22.750 --> 01:53:23.666
No.

01:53:24.333 --> 01:53:27.333
I made you come here.

01:53:27.583 --> 01:53:29.125
Your situation is like a fool

01:53:29.208 --> 01:53:31.083
who followed a trail of smoke,
only to be caught in the fire.

01:53:34.500 --> 01:53:36.375
You'll burn to death!

01:53:36.833 --> 01:53:38.958
I'm the fire engine!

01:53:39.416 --> 01:53:41.791
I don't care how big the flames get,

01:53:42.583 --> 01:53:44.333
I will douse them all.

01:53:46.125 --> 01:53:48.041
Your death stands before you!

01:53:48.416 --> 01:53:49.833
Don't you feel fear?

01:53:51.625 --> 01:53:54.875
I am not even afraid
of my own reflection in the mirror,

01:53:56.208 --> 01:53:58.583
so why the heck should I fear you?

01:54:33.666 --> 01:54:36.125
Boss, they'll finish him off anyway.

01:54:36.333 --> 01:54:37.458
Our dealers are waiting.

01:54:37.750 --> 01:54:38.708
Let's go, Boss.

01:58:17.625 --> 01:58:18.916
What will this do?

01:58:19.250 --> 01:58:23.416
If this goes from five to ten,
nobody will be able to touch you.

01:58:27.541 --> 01:58:29.500
If this goes from fifteen to twenty,

01:58:29.583 --> 01:58:32.333
you'll become invincible.

01:58:33.625 --> 01:58:36.041
But, if it goes from
twenty-five to thirty,

01:58:36.708 --> 01:58:39.291
it might get fatal for you.

01:59:30.458 --> 01:59:32.000
Boss, what is the emergency?

01:59:32.166 --> 01:59:34.083
You have summoned
all the dealers in India.

01:59:34.333 --> 01:59:36.625
I don't care what you guys do.

01:59:37.166 --> 01:59:38.958
You guys have only three days.

01:59:39.875 --> 01:59:42.375
All the consignments must be delivered.

01:59:42.541 --> 01:59:45.750
Boss, in just three days?
How is that possible?

01:59:45.833 --> 01:59:46.708
Boss?

01:59:46.833 --> 01:59:48.541
Did they manage to kill him?

01:59:48.625 --> 01:59:49.541
No, Boss.

01:59:49.916 --> 01:59:51.958
He killed them all!

02:00:02.208 --> 02:00:05.541
I'm faced with a worthy foe
for the first time!

02:00:07.458 --> 02:00:08.333
Hey.

02:00:09.250 --> 02:00:10.875
You follow up with these guys.

02:00:11.791 --> 02:00:14.166
I'll take care of him.

02:00:21.458 --> 02:00:22.500
That's why I warned you.

02:00:23.500 --> 02:00:25.125
Life with me isn't worth it.

02:00:26.083 --> 02:00:27.708
Today, I've arrived with an injury.

02:00:28.916 --> 02:00:30.666
Someday, my corpse will arrive.

02:00:31.916 --> 02:00:34.500
What joy will you find in marrying me?

02:00:41.791 --> 02:00:46.375
I can live happily with a man
who values a good home.

02:00:47.208 --> 02:00:49.916
I could be even happier
as a widow to a man

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:52.375
who sees the nation as his home.

02:01:06.666 --> 02:01:10.541
Look me in the eye

02:01:10.708 --> 02:01:13.458
Let time stand still

02:01:13.958 --> 02:01:18.916
I can't go on without you

02:01:19.291 --> 02:01:23.250
A glimpse of you gives me a thrill

02:01:23.333 --> 02:01:26.000
Sweet torture I can't bear

02:01:26.583 --> 02:01:31.500
Just kiss me, don't say a thing!

02:01:31.583 --> 02:01:36.208
My heart is gone, it's with you

02:01:36.291 --> 02:01:39.416
Please give it back, I'm missing you

02:01:39.500 --> 02:01:42.500
Things you'd never do

02:01:42.583 --> 02:01:47.208
Do them for me, I'm begging you

02:01:47.875 --> 02:01:51.583
Look me in the eye

02:01:51.750 --> 02:01:54.458
Let time stand still

02:01:55.000 --> 02:02:00.208
I can't go on without you

02:02:16.500 --> 02:02:22.333
I long for you, my dear
The warmth of your breath, so near

02:02:22.750 --> 02:02:28.333
Your kiss is a rush
Exciting and unique

02:02:29.166 --> 02:02:35.125
My fingers reach, so light and slow

02:02:35.625 --> 02:02:41.166
Waiting for your consent to let it flow

02:02:41.458 --> 02:02:44.541
It's a mystery, so enchanting!

02:02:44.625 --> 02:02:47.583
Say yes to this sweet partnership

02:02:47.708 --> 02:02:50.625
And wrap me in your warm grip

02:02:50.791 --> 02:02:55.000
All I need is your comforting embrace

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:00.916
It's not the fear of
what might happen to me.

02:03:03.500 --> 02:03:05.791
I'm afraid something might
happen to you because of me.

02:03:08.791 --> 02:03:11.083
I lived as your wife for a day.

02:03:11.791 --> 02:03:12.750
That's enough.

02:03:15.333 --> 02:03:16.625
Let anything come my way.

02:03:16.791 --> 02:03:20.541
Look me in the eye

02:03:20.708 --> 02:03:23.416
Let time stand still

02:03:24.041 --> 02:03:28.875
I can't go on without you

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:31.833
Sir.

02:03:31.958 --> 02:03:34.333
I need a comprehensive approach.

02:03:34.416 --> 02:03:36.458
-Sir, you have to look at this.
-What's this?

02:03:36.916 --> 02:03:38.541
This is South Station's FIR copy.

02:03:39.208 --> 02:03:42.000
-So what?
-Narayan took this complaint copy.

02:03:42.083 --> 02:03:44.833
Bagheera killed all the accused
on the same night.

02:03:45.583 --> 02:03:48.291
But this FIR copy
isn't available in the system.

02:03:48.708 --> 02:03:50.333
What? Wait a minute.

02:03:51.083 --> 02:03:52.000
What are you saying?

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:53.875
Oh, my God.

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:56.625
Check for similar FIR copies.

02:03:56.708 --> 02:03:57.583
Yes, sir.

02:03:58.041 --> 02:03:59.750
-Get every one of them. Fast.
-Sure, sir.

02:04:09.458 --> 02:04:13.125
Did you see the seven seas
Come together?

02:04:13.208 --> 02:04:14.666
How did you come?

02:04:14.750 --> 02:04:16.750
-Did you get the complaint copies?
-Yes, sir.

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:18.208
They've gone to get it.
They'll be here shortly.

02:04:18.333 --> 02:04:20.000
"Seven!" It's a good song, right?

02:04:20.208 --> 02:04:21.291
Super, sir!

02:04:21.500 --> 02:04:23.333
Seven seas…

02:04:23.416 --> 02:04:24.625
Which film's song is this?

02:04:24.958 --> 02:04:26.708
I don't know, sir.

02:04:27.083 --> 02:04:28.958
Seven seas seem like canals to me…

02:04:29.666 --> 02:04:31.583
-Find out about this.
-Okay, sir.

02:04:31.750 --> 02:04:34.750
I crossed them
And came over, you devil!

02:04:35.041 --> 02:04:38.458
A demon called Lankini
Is guarding the doorway to Lanka

02:04:38.541 --> 02:04:39.708
Did you get it?

02:04:39.833 --> 02:04:42.375
Sir, I don't know
which film this song is from.

02:04:43.458 --> 02:04:46.916
-I asked about the complaint copies.
-They're here, sir.

02:04:49.208 --> 02:04:50.083
Sir.

02:04:50.541 --> 02:04:52.041
We got a total of five complaint copies.

02:04:53.208 --> 02:04:56.458
First complaint… Ravi and gang
for murder and extortion.

02:04:56.791 --> 02:04:58.458
Killed by Bagheera on the same night, sir.

02:04:58.583 --> 02:05:01.208
Second copy… Ex-minister's son
acid attack case.

02:05:01.291 --> 02:05:02.750
Killed by Bagheera on the same night, sir.

02:05:02.833 --> 02:05:05.541
Next copy… Minor girl raped by
Hari and gang, sir.

02:05:05.625 --> 02:05:07.875
-And--
-And killed by Bagheera on the same night.

02:05:09.041 --> 02:05:12.375
I need a naive constable
from that station.

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.958
-Sir, Govinda. South Station constable.
-Sir.

02:05:18.041 --> 02:05:19.083
Come in. Take a seat.

02:05:19.541 --> 02:05:20.375
It's okay, sir.

02:05:20.916 --> 02:05:22.958
-I want some details from you.
-Okay, sir.

02:05:23.583 --> 02:05:24.458
Start it.

02:05:25.875 --> 02:05:29.583
He is infamous worldwide
for his corruption. Next one.

02:05:31.583 --> 02:05:32.416
How is he?

02:05:33.208 --> 02:05:34.708
Sir, what do you mean?

02:05:35.083 --> 02:05:38.583
Is he very strict, accepts bribes,
or works efficiently? Give me details.

02:05:38.666 --> 02:05:39.791
Sir, the thing is…

02:05:39.875 --> 02:05:42.083
If you answer me properly,
you'll be promoted.

02:05:42.541 --> 02:05:43.916
Otherwise, you'll be fired.

02:05:44.791 --> 02:05:47.375
Sir, he is not bothered by anything.

02:05:48.250 --> 02:05:50.250
He's happy with what he gets.

02:05:50.500 --> 02:05:51.333
Next.

02:05:51.583 --> 02:05:53.541
How's Narayan?

02:05:53.750 --> 02:05:57.666
He takes great care of everyone.

02:05:58.291 --> 02:05:59.916
He doesn't spend a single penny.

02:06:00.791 --> 02:06:01.958
Sorry, sir.

02:06:04.458 --> 02:06:05.375
What about him?

02:06:13.083 --> 02:06:13.916
Dead end.

02:06:15.375 --> 02:06:16.625
Go. I'll ask you to
come back when needed.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:17.833
Okay, sir.

02:06:18.208 --> 02:06:20.125
Sir… promotion?

02:06:20.208 --> 02:06:21.958
Assume my position after I retire.

02:06:22.791 --> 02:06:23.625
Get going.

02:06:25.833 --> 02:06:28.666
-Vedanth is the batch topper.
-Oh.

02:06:28.750 --> 02:06:29.625
Gold medalist.

02:06:29.791 --> 02:06:32.083
How can officers
like these become corrupt?

02:06:34.583 --> 02:06:37.708
Sir, he wasn't like this earlier.

02:06:39.916 --> 02:06:41.000
What do you mean?

02:06:41.875 --> 02:06:42.750
Sir.

02:06:43.166 --> 02:06:45.458
He was very strict
when he joined the force.

02:06:45.583 --> 02:06:47.166
He didn't accept a single penny in bribes.

02:06:47.291 --> 02:06:48.958
No criminal activities were going on.

02:06:49.083 --> 02:06:50.500
He cleaned up half the city.

02:06:50.875 --> 02:06:51.875
Why did he change?

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.958
The Commissioner berated him.

02:06:55.125 --> 02:06:55.958
He changed.

02:06:56.625 --> 02:06:57.500
For such a simple reason?

02:06:57.583 --> 02:07:00.875
A girl committed suicide
in front of the station.

02:07:00.958 --> 02:07:01.833
The…

02:07:01.916 --> 02:07:03.916
Yes, sir. The rape case.

02:07:04.083 --> 02:07:06.291
He didn't meddle in other's activities.

02:07:06.458 --> 02:07:08.125
He just focused on his work.

02:07:08.208 --> 02:07:10.041
-He didn't interfere in other's work.
-Wait a minute.

02:07:11.125 --> 02:07:13.791
Didn't Bagheera kill
all the rapists that day?

02:07:14.333 --> 02:07:15.166
Yes, sir.

02:07:16.666 --> 02:07:18.125
-You can leave.
-Sir.

02:07:21.541 --> 02:07:22.375
-Chethan.
-Sir.

02:07:22.458 --> 02:07:24.041
-I want the complete footage of Vedanth.
-Okay, sir.

02:07:24.125 --> 02:07:25.291
-Track all his movements.
-Yes, sir.

02:07:25.375 --> 02:07:27.541
-Especially the training videos.
-Yes, sir.

02:07:30.250 --> 02:07:33.291
I want to see Bagheera's CCTV footage
on this monitor.

02:07:33.375 --> 02:07:34.250
Okay, sir.

02:07:34.625 --> 02:07:37.750
-Freeze it right there.
-Yes, sir.

02:07:37.916 --> 02:07:40.000
Good. Now come to the CCTV monitor.

02:07:40.083 --> 02:07:42.333
Yeah. Zoom in. Stop.

02:07:43.291 --> 02:07:45.375
-Match both of them.
-Yes, sir.

02:07:45.750 --> 02:07:46.958
-Match them.
-Okay, sir.

02:07:47.375 --> 02:07:49.833
Hold it right there. Get the
face shot of both of them.

02:07:51.416 --> 02:07:52.916
That's it. Take this mask
and place it there.

02:07:53.541 --> 02:07:54.375
Okay, sir.

02:07:54.458 --> 02:07:55.708
-Just switch.
-Sir.

02:07:59.583 --> 02:08:00.916
-Hold it right there.
-Sir.

02:08:02.666 --> 02:08:04.583
Verify if they both match.

02:08:05.291 --> 02:08:06.125
Yes, sir.

02:08:06.791 --> 02:08:07.833
Yes!

02:08:10.125 --> 02:08:11.250
Yes!

02:08:19.333 --> 02:08:20.250
My God.

02:08:26.541 --> 02:08:27.375
Boss.

02:08:28.250 --> 02:08:29.541
We found Bagheera.

02:08:48.250 --> 02:08:50.791
Sir, Yogi's phone
has been traced to a port.

02:10:18.041 --> 02:10:21.333
-Yes, Sneha.
-Vedanth aka Bagheera!

02:10:24.958 --> 02:10:26.500
You toyed with us.

02:10:27.208 --> 02:10:28.875
Now, I'll play a game with you.

02:10:29.500 --> 02:10:30.791
The problem is…

02:10:31.458 --> 02:10:34.916
you'll lose no matter what.

02:10:36.041 --> 02:10:38.458
I know where you're headed.

02:10:39.500 --> 02:10:41.250
If you don't go there,

02:10:41.958 --> 02:10:43.875
fifty people will die.

02:10:48.541 --> 02:10:51.000
If you don't come here,

02:10:52.083 --> 02:10:54.083
your girl will die.

02:10:59.541 --> 02:11:03.083
Decide where you want to go.

02:11:10.541 --> 02:11:12.291
People who obstruct me,

02:11:12.416 --> 02:11:14.166
people who confront me,

02:11:14.708 --> 02:11:16.708
have died miserably.

02:11:16.791 --> 02:11:18.583
It's time you knew about it.

02:12:40.041 --> 02:12:41.708
Check if he's here.

02:12:52.833 --> 02:12:53.916
He won't come.

02:12:54.916 --> 02:12:56.666
Won't he come to save you?

02:12:57.250 --> 02:12:59.000
He would've come if he were Vedanth.

02:13:00.958 --> 02:13:02.250
But he's Bagheera.

02:13:03.958 --> 02:13:05.166
He protects them.

02:13:07.916 --> 02:13:09.416
Uncle, we're drowning.

02:13:09.500 --> 02:13:11.000
-Come and save us.
-Uncle.

02:13:11.125 --> 02:13:12.541
We're drowning.

02:13:12.666 --> 02:13:14.333
Help us.

02:13:14.583 --> 02:13:16.291
We're drowning.

02:13:17.375 --> 02:13:20.000
-Save us.
-Please, help.

02:13:21.958 --> 02:13:24.250
-Grab my hand.
-Uncle!

02:13:25.375 --> 02:13:27.916
Uncle, please save us.

02:13:32.125 --> 02:13:34.875
Unfortunately, you're dying
for such a guy.

02:13:36.125 --> 02:13:38.416
I'm not scared of dying.

02:13:39.750 --> 02:13:43.291
But I'm disappointed to be dying
without witnessing him kill you.

02:13:46.708 --> 02:13:49.666
Wow, my Rani of Jhansi!

02:13:50.500 --> 02:13:53.833
-Please save us.
-Uncle!

02:13:55.458 --> 02:13:58.208
Please save us.

02:13:58.291 --> 02:14:00.541
Help.

02:14:00.625 --> 02:14:02.416
Save us.

02:14:03.166 --> 02:14:05.166
We're drowning.

02:14:07.666 --> 02:14:09.875
Help us.

02:14:10.375 --> 02:14:12.208
Lock it now! Here.

02:14:17.791 --> 02:14:19.083
Save us.

02:14:21.875 --> 02:14:23.000
We're drowning.

02:14:30.958 --> 02:14:34.541
-Save us.
-Uncle…

02:14:37.458 --> 02:14:38.875
Help!

02:14:39.291 --> 02:14:41.041
Please save us.

02:14:42.833 --> 02:14:44.416
Help us.

02:15:05.333 --> 02:15:09.666
Look me in the eye

02:15:09.916 --> 02:15:12.916
Let time stand still

02:15:13.541 --> 02:15:19.458
I can't go on without you

02:16:42.208 --> 02:16:43.125
Bagheera.

02:16:44.458 --> 02:16:45.666
You played a nice game.

02:16:46.375 --> 02:16:48.791
For the first time in my life,
I feared I was losing.

02:16:52.958 --> 02:16:54.000
Hey!

02:16:54.458 --> 02:16:57.458
We shouldn't know
the face behind that mask.

02:16:59.416 --> 02:17:03.916
Mom, will they kill him for saving us?

02:17:06.625 --> 02:17:07.500
Sir.

02:17:38.916 --> 02:17:40.583
-Move!
-Hurry up, move.

02:17:40.666 --> 02:17:42.958
All the consignments have been loaded.

02:17:43.833 --> 02:17:46.208
Until the train reaches Rameswaram port,

02:17:46.916 --> 02:17:51.250
you should ensure no one stops the train.

02:18:04.250 --> 02:18:05.958
Such a scoundrel you are!

02:18:06.083 --> 02:18:07.333
You destroyed my household!

02:18:07.416 --> 02:18:09.875
You never said anything
despite knowing everything!

02:18:11.666 --> 02:18:12.791
Sir, don't do this.

02:18:13.333 --> 02:18:14.375
-This is wrong.
-What?!

02:18:15.125 --> 02:18:16.083
What are you even talking about?!

02:18:16.166 --> 02:18:18.208
We are going to kill Bagheera.

02:18:18.375 --> 02:18:19.208
This is wrong.

02:18:19.625 --> 02:18:21.125
How is it wrong?

02:18:21.375 --> 02:18:22.750
Hasn't he killed a lot of people himself?

02:18:22.958 --> 02:18:23.791
Isn't that wrong?

02:18:23.916 --> 02:18:26.500
Sir, he has accomplished things
we could never achieve.

02:18:26.583 --> 02:18:28.000
Sir, please think about it.

02:18:28.208 --> 02:18:30.291
Stop bugging me with your nonsense!

02:18:30.625 --> 02:18:33.750
You people got my son killed
for your own selfish reasons!

02:18:35.125 --> 02:18:37.125
Sir, it doesn't matter if you scold me
or even lay hands on me,

02:18:37.291 --> 02:18:38.708
but please don't do
what you are about to do.

02:18:39.083 --> 02:18:40.166
Will you just shut up?

02:18:42.958 --> 02:18:44.625
Sir, please!

02:18:44.708 --> 02:18:46.375
Stop! Stop the vehicle!

02:18:46.708 --> 02:18:48.625
-Sir?
-Stop the vehicle now!

02:19:13.333 --> 02:19:15.250
If you had told me that
Bagheera was my own son,

02:19:15.375 --> 02:19:17.875
I would have talked sense into him.

02:19:18.291 --> 02:19:20.125
Speak up! Why are you silent?

02:19:23.416 --> 02:19:25.833
Sir, please! Don't do this!
Please listen to me!

02:19:26.166 --> 02:19:28.125
Sir, please listen to me.

02:19:28.291 --> 02:19:29.958
Sir, this is wrong! Please don't do this!

02:19:31.333 --> 02:19:32.500
I can't believe this!

02:19:33.666 --> 02:19:34.666
What are you even saying?!

02:19:34.791 --> 02:19:36.625
Yes, sir, that is the truth.

02:19:38.875 --> 02:19:40.250
Would you have thrown him under the bus

02:19:40.500 --> 02:19:41.875
like this if he were your son as well?

02:19:42.333 --> 02:19:43.291
Speak up!

02:19:43.625 --> 02:19:44.625
Speak up, damn it!

02:19:46.500 --> 02:19:47.583
Sir, please don't do this!

02:19:50.291 --> 02:19:51.166
How can this be possible?!

02:19:51.958 --> 02:19:53.666
This concerns the honor
of our department.

02:19:54.083 --> 02:19:55.916
That is correct, sir,
but we must call a spade a spade.

02:19:56.166 --> 02:19:59.208
That is correct, sir,
but we must call a spade "a spade".

02:20:04.291 --> 02:20:06.041
I don't have a son like yours,

02:20:07.458 --> 02:20:08.958
I am not that fortunate.

02:20:10.166 --> 02:20:11.458
What do you mean by saying

02:20:11.541 --> 02:20:13.041
you're unable to apprehend
the culprit who killed my son?

02:20:23.833 --> 02:20:25.333
No matter how much you scold me,

02:20:25.875 --> 02:20:28.958
I won't get angry with you or feel upset.

02:20:29.416 --> 02:20:31.333
I tried, sir. But I failed.

02:20:33.416 --> 02:20:34.666
Then why have you come here?

02:20:34.958 --> 02:20:36.791
Sir, please give me another chance,
I will definitely nab him.

02:20:41.500 --> 02:20:42.541
Get lost!

02:20:42.791 --> 02:20:44.541
-Sir?
-Get out!

02:20:45.083 --> 02:20:45.958
Out!

02:20:49.666 --> 02:20:54.375
Sir, why did you admit defeat
in order to save him?

02:20:54.583 --> 02:20:58.000
Everyone remembers
Bhagat Singh, Subhash Chandra Bose,

02:20:59.250 --> 02:21:02.333
and the father of our nation,
Mahatma Gandhi.

02:21:02.625 --> 02:21:04.833
This defeat brings me more happiness

02:21:05.750 --> 02:21:07.250
than all the times I have won in life.

02:21:07.541 --> 02:21:13.458
But no one remembers their parents.

02:21:13.791 --> 02:21:15.916
Sir, you had said that even
if a god-like person goes to the temple

02:21:16.625 --> 02:21:20.250
he won't be allowed to perform
the rituals, only a priest has to do it.

02:21:20.375 --> 02:21:21.333
Isn't that the truth?

02:21:22.333 --> 02:21:24.708
A god-like man
won't be able to do anything,

02:21:24.958 --> 02:21:26.750
but a god can do everything.

02:21:26.833 --> 02:21:28.833
You have given birth
to such an exceptional person!

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:33.000
You are really great!

02:21:33.875 --> 02:21:34.708
You're great!

02:21:35.208 --> 02:21:36.708
He's not just a god-like person,

02:21:37.458 --> 02:21:38.416
he's a god himself.

02:21:39.666 --> 02:21:42.208
Let him do whatever he wants.

02:21:42.833 --> 02:21:43.666
Who are we to ask?

02:21:45.333 --> 02:21:49.291
In my eyes, you have become
the father of the nation.

02:22:07.833 --> 02:22:08.958
Sir, I have done as you ordered.

02:22:16.833 --> 02:22:18.125
Boss, we found Bagheera!

02:22:40.416 --> 02:22:42.250
Sorry, Vedanth,
you had to go through all this.

02:22:42.416 --> 02:22:43.708
I need another favor from you.

02:22:44.250 --> 02:22:47.083
Rana is taking two thousand people
in a freight train

02:22:47.416 --> 02:22:49.250
to the Rameswaram fishing harbor.

02:22:49.500 --> 02:22:52.625
The moment he reaches the harbor,
he will become unstoppable.

02:22:53.041 --> 02:22:54.666
Only you can stop him.

02:22:55.375 --> 02:22:58.666
I can't do anything else
other than give this information to you.

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.750
I hope to hear the good news.

02:23:11.458 --> 02:23:15.333
To the Lord who is the savior
Of all worlds

02:23:15.416 --> 02:23:19.041
To the mighty Virabhadra
The bearer of the weapon

02:23:19.375 --> 02:23:23.208
To the one who dances the tandava
To destroy arrogance and vain gatherings

02:23:23.333 --> 02:23:27.083
To Neelakanta
The fierce Rudra who protects all

02:23:27.166 --> 02:23:31.166
To the merciful yet stern one
The destroyer of Krishna's actions

02:23:31.291 --> 02:23:33.166
To the one who shatters
The intoxicated ego

02:23:33.250 --> 02:23:34.916
To the nurturer of the devotees

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:39.000
Lord Shiva!

02:23:39.125 --> 02:23:41.541
Who are you praying
to my child?

02:23:41.708 --> 02:23:44.041
Which god will come
to save us from here?

02:23:44.250 --> 02:23:45.458
Don't say that.

02:23:45.541 --> 02:23:48.958
My mom always tells me
that if I recite these verses,

02:23:49.166 --> 02:23:55.041
God will rescue us
no matter what dire situation we are in.

02:24:29.083 --> 02:24:30.458
Bagheera.

02:24:32.083 --> 02:24:32.916
Come on!

02:30:46.208 --> 02:30:50.416
Look me in the eye

02:30:50.708 --> 02:30:53.833
Let time stand still

02:30:54.416 --> 02:30:59.583
I can't go on without you

02:32:04.833 --> 02:32:08.291
What's the breaking news
for which we traveled this far?

02:32:08.750 --> 02:32:09.833
There's no one here.

02:32:10.375 --> 02:32:11.916
What breaking news
can we expect to receive at this place?

02:32:12.291 --> 02:32:13.666
Sure, sir. Okay.

02:32:16.083 --> 02:32:17.000
What is this?!

02:32:17.333 --> 02:32:18.250
Who are these people?

02:32:27.541 --> 02:32:29.458
Who are you people?
Where are you coming from?

02:32:29.666 --> 02:32:31.458
We were all kidnapped, sir.

02:32:31.541 --> 02:32:33.791
What? Who kidnapped you?

02:32:33.916 --> 02:32:35.250
We don't know.

02:32:35.375 --> 02:32:36.291
Who rescued you?

02:32:36.708 --> 02:32:37.666
God.

02:32:40.708 --> 02:32:42.166
-God?
-Yes, sir.

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:44.333
The child is telling the truth.

02:32:44.916 --> 02:32:47.416
The one who saved us
was none other than God.

02:33:15.458 --> 02:33:17.833
Sir, this kidnapping racket,
human trafficking,

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:21.125
and illegal transport
are all happening through goods trains.

02:33:22.333 --> 02:33:24.666
Many people from the railway department
are involved in this.

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:25.875
This should be stopped.

02:33:28.458 --> 02:33:29.791
I will give you full authority.

02:33:30.916 --> 02:33:32.041
Go and conduct an inquiry.

02:33:32.166 --> 02:33:33.625
Bring an end to all of them.

02:33:34.291 --> 02:33:35.625
You should be the one to end this.

02:33:38.541 --> 02:33:39.375
What?!

02:33:39.875 --> 02:33:40.791
What do you mean?

02:33:41.083 --> 02:33:44.000
We both know that
you are the one who's behind all of this.

02:33:45.166 --> 02:33:47.708
If you accept this, resign, and surrender,

02:33:48.750 --> 02:33:50.333
you will be treated like a VIP in jail,

02:33:50.500 --> 02:33:51.541
and you will be safe there.

02:33:51.875 --> 02:33:52.916
Think about it.

02:33:53.500 --> 02:33:54.458
If I refuse?

02:33:54.916 --> 02:33:56.916
What can I do?

02:33:57.541 --> 02:34:00.583
You have tied my hands in the name
of rules, regulations, and transfers.

02:34:02.041 --> 02:34:05.416
But he is not bound by any rules.

02:34:09.541 --> 02:34:10.416
Think about it.

02:34:14.166 --> 02:34:15.041
Hey!

02:34:16.041 --> 02:34:18.250
Do you know who I am?

02:34:18.916 --> 02:34:20.208
I am the Central Minister.

02:34:20.833 --> 02:34:23.958
I have seen a lot of people,
I have thrashed a lot of people.

02:34:24.125 --> 02:34:27.416
Do you have any idea how many people
I had to eliminate to reach this position?

02:34:28.666 --> 02:34:30.333
No one can touch me.

02:34:30.875 --> 02:34:32.000
Who is he?

02:34:34.041 --> 02:34:35.333
Who is he?

02:34:37.333 --> 02:34:38.333
Bagheera.

02:35:49.416 --> 02:35:52.583
I will become a superhero, Mom.
