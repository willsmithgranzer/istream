00:39.666 --> 00:41.333
<i>What are you going to sing for us today?</i>

00:41.500 --> 00:42.750
<i>This is a special one.</i>

00:43.083 --> 00:45.875
<i>And it's in my mother tongue… Telugu.</i>

00:46.166 --> 00:47.208
<i>Interesting.</i>

00:47.541 --> 00:50.166
<i>We just have to check your voice.</i>
<i>Let's see if you got it in you.</i>

00:50.375 --> 00:51.208
Thank you.

01:21.041 --> 01:23.500
<i>Just determine inside and see…</i>

01:25.166 --> 01:29.375
<i>It will be done just like that</i>

01:30.833 --> 01:33.291
<i>Your dream has to come behind…</i>

01:35.000 --> 01:39.291
<i>Following you like a shadow</i>

01:39.958 --> 01:44.166
<i>Listen to the thunders</i>

01:44.708 --> 01:49.208
<i>Stretch your hands for the raindrops</i>

01:49.666 --> 01:53.041
<i>Like seven colors</i>

01:53.125 --> 01:57.125
<i>Hundred years</i>
<i>You have to flourish</i>

01:57.208 --> 01:58.333
Yeah. Ready, guys?

02:11.583 --> 02:12.916
- Sir!
- What is tomorrow's schedule?

02:13.083 --> 02:14.541
Meeting with the cloaks at 2:00 p.m.

02:14.625 --> 02:15.791
- After lunch, right?
- Yeah, right.

02:15.875 --> 02:18.708
We have a calibration call with the
Bronocks for the upcoming fashion week.

02:18.791 --> 02:19.916
And we need templates as well.

02:20.166 --> 02:21.083
They will be ready by tomorrow.

02:21.166 --> 02:22.666
- You will receive the email.
- Okay, sir.

02:22.750 --> 02:24.708
Viraj, did you deny shooting
for the Bravokis?

02:24.791 --> 02:25.625
- Yes, I did.
- Why?

02:25.708 --> 02:27.500
It is such a big company.
We will lose our goodwill if we deny them.

02:27.583 --> 02:29.125
- When is the shoot?
- Next month… Twenty…

02:30.000 --> 02:31.666
- First!
- Hallelujah!

02:31.750 --> 02:33.958
- Send Amul. Tell them I recommended him.
- Amul?

02:34.041 --> 02:35.875
Amul won't do.

02:35.958 --> 02:37.708
Would you send a soldier
if they ask for a bishop?

02:37.791 --> 02:39.125
It is impossible.

02:39.208 --> 02:40.750
Look, I have committed.

02:41.208 --> 02:42.791
I will be screwed if you don't do this.

02:43.041 --> 02:43.875
Then get screwed.

02:44.750 --> 02:45.583
Vi…

02:45.916 --> 02:46.750
Viraj!

03:07.916 --> 03:09.625
Is it? Really?

03:10.125 --> 03:10.958
Hi!

03:16.625 --> 03:17.500
Hey.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.750
Your favorite fish.
Have at it!

04:02.833 --> 04:03.666
Thank you.

04:16.541 --> 04:18.500
What's up with the drawing on the plate?
Something must be wrong.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.458
What happened to my darling Mahi?

04:21.958 --> 04:24.666
There is a boy called Varun in my class.

04:30.125 --> 04:31.375
Is this an age to think about a boy?

04:36.750 --> 04:37.583
Who is that guy?

04:37.666 --> 04:39.916
I don't know which school he came from.

04:40.416 --> 04:42.500
He has been topping
since the last two exams!

04:43.583 --> 04:46.000
He beat me by one percent…

04:48.708 --> 04:49.625
You misunderstood.

04:53.125 --> 04:55.000
Mahi. It's okay.

04:55.083 --> 04:56.416
It's not okay, Grandpa.

04:56.500 --> 04:57.916
It's just one percent dear.

04:58.541 --> 04:59.958
One percent, Dad.

05:00.333 --> 05:02.083
With one percent,
I've lost my reputation.

05:02.666 --> 05:03.750
How can you say that?

05:05.250 --> 05:06.083
Mahi.

05:06.958 --> 05:08.041
Remember one thing.

05:08.666 --> 05:09.875
It isn't the goal,

05:09.958 --> 05:12.166
but the journey that should be amazing.

05:12.750 --> 05:13.833
Not the result,

05:14.458 --> 05:16.125
but the experience must be important.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.833
Winning and losing is God's will.

05:24.416 --> 05:26.166
Is this how you motivate
a six-year-old girl?

05:26.666 --> 05:31.583
Says the father, who assumed his
six-year-old daughter had a boyfriend.

05:35.666 --> 05:36.833
What's today's story?

05:37.125 --> 05:38.000
A brand new one.

05:38.291 --> 05:40.458
Fine, let's go!

05:41.833 --> 05:44.416
"Once upon a time, there was a king…"

05:44.500 --> 05:46.916
Wait. Who should I imagine as the king?

05:47.916 --> 05:49.250
Who else? Me!

05:50.916 --> 05:51.875
Okay, continue.

05:52.916 --> 05:56.208
"And the king had a beautiful
daughter named, Tara."

05:56.708 --> 05:58.708
That's me.

06:00.125 --> 06:00.958
Obviously.

06:01.708 --> 06:04.083
"One day, the king, his minister,
and his commander…"

06:04.166 --> 06:05.416
- Dad, wait…
- I got it.

06:06.208 --> 06:08.208
Grandpa is the minister,
and Justin is the commander.

06:08.625 --> 06:10.083
Okay, continue.

06:12.208 --> 06:13.083
So…

06:13.375 --> 06:15.458
"They all went out…"

06:35.791 --> 06:39.250
"And that's how Tara found the wand
and saved the king and the kingdom."

06:40.666 --> 06:42.583
- That's it?
- That's it.

06:42.666 --> 06:44.416
No mother in this story as well?

06:47.625 --> 06:48.458
No.

06:51.583 --> 06:52.750
You keep doing this.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.291
Do stories exist without a mother?

06:55.375 --> 06:56.250
Some do.

06:57.041 --> 06:58.958
Then I want a story with a mother.

06:59.625 --> 07:01.375
Otherwise, I'm not taking tablets.

07:02.791 --> 07:05.333
You always come up with excuses.

07:06.041 --> 07:07.083
You have to tell me now.

07:07.375 --> 07:10.416
Even my school friends
are asking about my mom.

07:14.666 --> 07:15.541
Fine, I will.

07:16.208 --> 07:17.083
But, not now.

07:18.000 --> 07:18.875
When?

07:21.041 --> 07:23.750
When you beat that Varun
and come first in class.

07:25.250 --> 07:26.125
Then, I will tell you.

07:27.791 --> 07:28.666
Your mom's story.

07:29.750 --> 07:30.833
Mother promise?

07:36.916 --> 07:37.833
Promise.

07:39.375 --> 07:40.416
Shall we take tablets now?

08:05.333 --> 08:08.666
Dad, I want a ukulele for this birthday.

08:09.250 --> 08:10.291
Sure.

08:11.625 --> 08:12.916
I love you, Dad.

08:13.166 --> 08:14.291
I love you, dear.

08:19.250 --> 08:20.208
Good night.

08:20.666 --> 08:21.500
Good night.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.125
You're narrating stories,
avoiding her mom.

08:48.833 --> 08:51.416
One day, you won't
be able to avoid the truth.

08:51.875 --> 08:52.791
Can you?

09:00.708 --> 09:01.750
There is still time for that.

09:05.250 --> 09:06.750
She has begun asking me
when you are not around.

09:07.750 --> 09:08.625
What should I say?

09:11.500 --> 09:15.125
Do you know what people
around are discussing?

09:15.208 --> 09:16.583
I don't care what people
do, think, or discuss.

09:16.875 --> 09:18.625
I only care about my daughter.

09:18.958 --> 09:21.041
But she is at a vulnerable age,
she can believe anything.

09:21.291 --> 09:24.708
You can ignore it.
But you are answerable to--

09:24.791 --> 09:25.916
What's the update on the
doctor's appointment?

09:28.791 --> 09:29.625
I spoke to her!

09:30.208 --> 09:32.666
She is an expert in 65 Roses.

09:33.041 --> 09:37.125
As per Sweden's time, 9:30 p.m.,
which is 2:00 a.m. for us.

09:37.458 --> 09:38.916
You have a video appointment.

09:44.833 --> 09:46.166
Don't stay up too late.

09:49.666 --> 09:50.500
Good night, Son.

11:28.791 --> 11:32.916
<i>Come here my dear glass doll</i>

11:33.208 --> 11:37.541
<i>I’m your father and mother</i>

11:37.625 --> 11:41.666
<i>My heart is a cradle branch to you</i>

11:41.875 --> 11:46.083
<i>This swinging hand is my love</i>

11:46.166 --> 11:49.750
<i>Lay…</i>

11:50.125 --> 11:54.666
<i>On this heart</i>

11:55.000 --> 11:58.666
<i>Play…</i>

11:59.166 --> 12:03.666
<i>In this abode</i>

12:04.750 --> 12:09.000
<i>Don’t go away from me</i>

12:25.458 --> 12:26.291
Mahi.

12:26.583 --> 12:27.583
Which one should I wear?
This one or this?

12:27.666 --> 12:28.875
I liked the green one.

12:42.875 --> 12:47.166
<i>I will bear these tiny tiny feet</i>

12:47.500 --> 12:51.458
<i>As the ground</i>

12:52.083 --> 12:56.250
<i>When you stumble while playing</i>

12:56.541 --> 13:00.208
<i>You will end up on me</i>

13:00.291 --> 13:04.875
<i>I will keep both my ears</i>
<i>With you and leave</i>

13:05.500 --> 13:12.500
<i>So that whatever you speak</i>

13:14.500 --> 13:18.375
<i>I can get back to you in a minute</i>

13:18.625 --> 13:23.166
<i>Leaving everything behind</i>

13:29.500 --> 13:32.458
<i>- Laughing all the way…</i>
<i>- Jingle bells--</i>

13:35.166 --> 13:36.083
- Hey.
- Dad?

13:37.708 --> 13:38.875
You know you can't eat this, right, Mahi?

13:38.958 --> 13:41.500
Don't worry.
We will have a pasta party.

13:46.083 --> 13:53.083
<i>I will stay as a guard</i>
<i>To your tripping breath</i>

13:55.041 --> 13:59.208
<i>I will carefully monitor your</i>

13:59.500 --> 14:03.291
<i>Every inhale and exhale</i>

14:03.375 --> 14:08.125
<i>Any kind of light rays have to cross me</i>

14:08.541 --> 14:14.291
<i>Before they reach your sight</i>

14:14.583 --> 14:21.458
<i>For that, I will become your eyelid…</i>

14:21.541 --> 14:25.916
<i>You are my eyelid!</i>

14:26.000 --> 14:27.208
What happened to her mother?

14:28.208 --> 14:29.041
Who knows?

14:29.333 --> 14:30.708
Rumor is that he left her.

14:31.791 --> 14:34.708
The poor wife must have
suffered because of Viraj.

14:39.875 --> 14:41.833
Miss Greeshma Desai, you are fired!

14:41.916 --> 14:43.791
Pack your things and leave.

14:51.541 --> 14:54.375
<i>Come here my dear glass doll</i>

14:56.041 --> 15:00.041
<i>I’m your father and mother</i>

15:00.416 --> 15:04.250
<i>My heart is a cradle branch to you</i>

15:04.666 --> 15:08.750
<i>This swinging hand is my love</i>

15:08.833 --> 15:12.541
<i>Lay…</i>

15:12.916 --> 15:17.250
<i>This on my heart</i>

15:17.791 --> 15:21.583
<i>Play…</i>

15:21.875 --> 15:26.291
<i>In this abode</i>

15:27.375 --> 15:32.041
<i>Don’t go away from me</i>

15:47.541 --> 15:48.958
Just cancel the whole goddamn event.

15:49.041 --> 15:49.916
Yes, you heard me right.

15:50.166 --> 15:52.583
It's not about money.
It's more about our reputation.

15:52.916 --> 15:55.708
- Did Mahi take her medicine?
- Yes sir. But, she isn't sleeping.

15:57.083 --> 15:57.916
Fine. You leave.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.125
I said I would talk to the client.

16:00.250 --> 16:01.125
Sir…?

16:01.500 --> 16:02.333
Okay.

16:02.625 --> 16:03.708
Just cancel the event.

16:17.416 --> 16:18.375
Haven't you slept yet?

16:32.458 --> 16:33.625
You've come first in the class.

16:33.708 --> 16:36.916
Not just one,
I beat Varun by two percent.

16:39.041 --> 16:40.333
I knew you'd do it.

16:40.666 --> 16:42.208
Congratulations, Mahi.

16:42.833 --> 16:44.041
Thank you, Dad.

16:44.333 --> 16:45.750
Dad had a very long day.

16:46.041 --> 16:47.000
I will take a shower.

16:47.083 --> 16:48.875
Alright. Come back quickly.
I'm waiting.

16:49.500 --> 16:50.958
Waiting? Why?

16:51.583 --> 16:53.041
Because I came first in class.

16:54.125 --> 16:55.750
And I congratulated you on that.

16:55.916 --> 16:57.666
Congrats are fine.
But what about Mom's story?

17:13.208 --> 17:14.125
I told you right, Mahi?

17:14.833 --> 17:15.958
Dad is exhausted.

17:17.416 --> 17:18.500
I have a lot of work to do.

17:18.875 --> 17:19.791
I will tell you some other time.

17:20.166 --> 17:22.375
But, Dad you promised me.

17:22.458 --> 17:24.375
I got the first rank as well.

17:24.458 --> 17:25.375
I know, Mahi.

17:26.958 --> 17:28.916
Please try to understand.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.625
Dad had a really bad day at the office.

17:30.708 --> 17:32.125
Some other time for sure.

17:32.208 --> 17:33.791
But, you promised me!

17:33.875 --> 17:35.000
What promise?

17:36.500 --> 17:38.375
Can't you understand?

17:43.250 --> 17:45.041
How many times have I told you,
not to come into this room?

17:45.125 --> 17:45.958
Go!

18:24.708 --> 18:25.708
Viraj! Get up!

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
Viraj!

18:27.208 --> 18:28.125
Viraj!

18:28.333 --> 18:29.166
Viraj! Get up!

18:32.666 --> 18:34.416
Viraj, Mahi is not to be seen.

18:34.500 --> 18:36.500
I got a call from her school.
She didn't turn up at school as well.

18:41.083 --> 18:44.125
I've searched everywhere.
Pluto is missing as well.

18:47.625 --> 18:48.583
I'm coming to the school now.

18:49.666 --> 18:51.250
Please let me know
if she comes there.

19:08.291 --> 19:09.375
Come quickly.

19:18.250 --> 19:19.958
Stop, Pluto, stop!

19:20.416 --> 19:22.625
Stop! Stop I say!

19:26.333 --> 19:27.541
Somebody, please help!

19:32.125 --> 19:33.666
Somebody catch him, please!

19:35.541 --> 19:37.666
Good dog. Down boy!

19:41.166 --> 19:42.083
Here you go!

19:47.833 --> 19:49.875
- Water?
- No, thank you.

19:50.541 --> 19:51.875
I don't drink outside water.

19:52.291 --> 19:54.875
Only warm water.

19:55.791 --> 19:57.875
Okay…

20:16.916 --> 20:19.333
I've got a condition called 65 Roses.

20:20.625 --> 20:23.791
Everyone says it is extremely fatal.

20:24.666 --> 20:28.250
But, Dad says that it is all a sham
and nothing will happen to me.

20:31.250 --> 20:35.000
I'm not supposed to jump,

20:35.958 --> 20:38.416
or run,

20:38.541 --> 20:43.416
or even eat that cotton candy.

20:43.875 --> 20:47.416
But, whenever I'm angry
with my Dad, I will eat.

20:50.458 --> 20:52.708
Thank you for your help. Bye.

20:53.125 --> 20:54.875
- Bye.
- Come, Pluto.

20:58.750 --> 20:59.666
Come.

20:59.750 --> 21:00.875
Come, Pluto.

21:01.375 --> 21:02.250
Pluto, come.

21:02.750 --> 21:04.625
Pluto.

21:04.791 --> 21:05.625
Pluto, come.

21:09.791 --> 21:11.125
She's nowhere to be seen.

21:11.250 --> 21:12.541
- You better go to the police station.
- Hello?

21:12.625 --> 21:13.541
Is this Mahi's father?

21:14.416 --> 21:16.500
- Yes.
- Come quickly to this location.

21:24.291 --> 21:25.250
Mahi, are you crazy?

21:27.166 --> 21:28.125
You came without telling anyone.

21:29.666 --> 21:30.541
Do you have any idea
what I went through?

21:31.083 --> 21:32.000
Do you think this is a game?

21:35.250 --> 21:36.125
My Dad.

21:38.500 --> 21:40.125
Did you even think a little?

21:40.375 --> 21:41.750
Hi, Dad. This is Yashna.

21:48.166 --> 21:50.375
- Viraj.
- Viraj.

21:51.333 --> 21:52.750
Do you know what just happened?

21:56.291 --> 21:58.250
Pluto.
Pluto, come.

21:58.583 --> 21:59.416
Pluto…

22:02.250 --> 22:04.875
The pace at which that truck barged at us…
I thought this was our last day.

22:07.625 --> 22:11.125
- Like in a flash. Everything--
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

22:11.625 --> 22:12.541
Not me.

22:12.958 --> 22:14.500
You should thank that truck driver.

22:17.791 --> 22:20.000
What is this, Mahi?
Why did you come here in the first place?

22:23.500 --> 22:24.666
To eat cotton candy.

22:25.791 --> 22:26.625
Cotton?

22:27.916 --> 22:29.000
Cotton candy!

22:30.791 --> 22:32.666
You know you aren't
supposed to eat cotton candy.

22:36.041 --> 22:37.875
Don't you know
you aren't supposed to break your promise?

22:40.666 --> 22:44.875
Just so she could hear her mother's story
she studied day and night for one month,

22:44.958 --> 22:49.416
she defeated Varun by two percent
and came first in the class.

22:49.500 --> 22:50.458
What did you do?

22:52.916 --> 22:55.916
You can break your promises.
Can't she eat cotton candy?

23:00.125 --> 23:01.291
- Ma'am?
- Yashna.

23:01.750 --> 23:02.583
Miss Yashna.

23:03.458 --> 23:05.541
I'm so grateful for your help.

23:06.500 --> 23:08.583
But, can I speak
to my daughter in private?

23:08.875 --> 23:11.125
Yeah, please.
Go ahead.

23:13.333 --> 23:14.583
Did you tell her everything?

23:18.458 --> 23:19.333
What now?

23:20.041 --> 23:23.416
You want your mom's story, right?

23:24.041 --> 23:25.916
I will tell you everything in the evening.
I promise!

23:28.791 --> 23:30.541
A mother promise didn't work!

23:30.916 --> 23:33.041
What can a normal promise do?

23:35.916 --> 23:36.750
After you reach home,

23:36.833 --> 23:40.791
what's the guarantee that you
won't come up with lame excuses?

23:41.333 --> 23:42.583
We don't trust you.

23:50.375 --> 23:51.666
Why are you intruding into our space?

23:52.625 --> 23:53.833
I will tell her whenever I wish to.

23:54.500 --> 23:55.333
Who are you?

23:55.458 --> 23:56.291
Look, Viraj.

23:56.625 --> 23:58.708
I was there today to save her.

23:59.083 --> 24:00.333
I might not be there every day.

24:00.833 --> 24:04.041
I promised Mahi
that I would ensure she got her story.

24:04.625 --> 24:07.541
I can't break my promise like you.

24:08.791 --> 24:11.291
Anyway, I'm done with my shopping.

24:11.375 --> 24:15.041
I'm free till the evening
and I have my coffee with me. And we are…

24:15.333 --> 24:16.291
all ears!

24:29.875 --> 24:31.458
We don't even know who she is.

24:31.708 --> 24:33.250
She is Yashna.
My friend.

24:44.125 --> 24:44.958
Don't I have a choice?

24:53.125 --> 24:53.958
One cappuccino.

25:03.583 --> 25:04.625
<i>Once upon a time…</i>

25:06.208 --> 25:07.250
in a small town.

25:09.125 --> 25:09.958
Steady.

25:11.291 --> 25:12.250
Right…

25:16.458 --> 25:17.333
Stop…

25:23.875 --> 25:24.791
Are you done?

25:38.291 --> 25:39.416
<i>A marvel in front of me.</i>

25:41.125 --> 25:42.000
Like a wonder.

25:44.875 --> 25:46.000
The rain was a witness.

26:06.916 --> 26:07.875
Dad, wait!

26:08.666 --> 26:10.541
- What happened?
- Whom should I Imagine?

26:11.583 --> 26:13.416
Who should I imagine as Mom?

26:23.750 --> 26:24.750
Mahi, look at me.

26:26.125 --> 26:27.083
Imagine me.

26:32.791 --> 26:34.875
Dad, continue…

26:44.083 --> 26:46.125
<i>Oh time!</i>

26:46.291 --> 26:51.208
<i>I swear you’ve helped me amazingly</i>

26:52.458 --> 26:58.125
<i>You’ve gifted my eyes with her beauty</i>

26:59.041 --> 27:01.500
<i>Isn’t it enough?</i>

27:01.583 --> 27:05.708
<i>Fine, fine don’t be hasty</i>

27:05.791 --> 27:09.458
<i>Where would this story go?</i>

27:10.041 --> 27:13.958
<i>Where do you think she is going?</i>

27:14.166 --> 27:17.833
<i>Finally, where would this end up?</i>

27:17.916 --> 27:20.083
<i>Oh time!</i>

27:20.291 --> 27:25.166
<i>I swear you’ve helped me amazingly</i>

27:26.416 --> 27:32.083
<i>You’ve gifted my eyes with her beauty</i>

27:33.125 --> 27:34.791
<i>Who is she?</i>

27:34.875 --> 27:36.791
<i>Is she a walking star?</i>

27:37.083 --> 27:38.958
<i>Is she a scintillating flow?</i>

27:39.166 --> 27:42.625
<i>I can’t sleep looking at her</i>

27:43.416 --> 27:45.333
<i>Did she speak?</i>

27:45.541 --> 27:47.541
<i>Her jauntiness is like wow!</i>

27:47.708 --> 27:52.375
<i>Is that floating beauty above her</i>
<i>What is her name?</i>

28:17.916 --> 28:21.916
<i>Your eyes have drunk</i>
<i>All the blue from the sky</i>

28:22.166 --> 28:25.833
<i>There is some magic in your glare</i>

28:26.416 --> 28:33.416
<i>The times of golden rains</i>
<i>People like us never expected</i>

28:35.041 --> 28:39.083
<i>That naughty lipline</i>
<i>Which can spin the earth</i>

28:39.166 --> 28:42.750
<i>Is showing a new dimension in you</i>

28:43.416 --> 28:47.458
<i>That jumping silence in</i>
<i>Your orange cheeks are staring</i>

28:47.708 --> 28:52.083
<i>At me and plucking my life out</i>

28:55.666 --> 28:57.250
What are you doing?

28:57.416 --> 28:58.250
Are you in love?

28:58.875 --> 29:00.125
Camera…

29:00.208 --> 29:01.791
- I'm talking to you.
- Sister, what happened?

29:02.166 --> 29:05.166
Aren't you ashamed to click
pictures of a girl you just saw?

29:06.166 --> 29:07.875
What happened, madam?
What's the problem?

29:08.541 --> 29:09.375
He…

29:11.291 --> 29:12.583
This man has been following me,

29:12.666 --> 29:14.625
and taking my photographs
without my permission.

29:15.125 --> 29:16.916
Sister, let's file a police complaint.

29:17.791 --> 29:18.666
Hi.

29:18.750 --> 29:21.875
What, brother? Are you crazy?

29:22.208 --> 29:23.041
What?

29:24.041 --> 29:24.875
Are you acting smart?

29:29.708 --> 29:31.916
He is behaving like a goon.

29:33.833 --> 29:36.000
- Camera.
- Idiot!

29:39.666 --> 29:40.875
Hello, excuse me.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.041
Why did you scold my friend?

29:42.375 --> 29:44.250
Be glad that I didn't kill him.

29:44.666 --> 29:47.916
Isn't he ashamed to follow girls
and take their pictures?

29:48.791 --> 29:50.750
- Sister, police complaint.
- Police!

29:53.208 --> 29:54.666
He is a passionate, aspiring photographer.

29:54.833 --> 29:56.041
Do you know Manish Lakhia?

29:56.625 --> 29:58.541
He is a famous photographer in Bombay.

29:58.875 --> 30:02.375
He is making a portfolio
to work under him.

30:02.625 --> 30:04.041
Look at those pictures.

30:04.333 --> 30:05.750
You won't find a single vulgar photo.

30:05.833 --> 30:06.666
Please.

30:10.833 --> 30:13.875
He was after you for his job,
not because he was in love with you.

30:15.791 --> 30:16.625
Hey, Pomeranian.

30:16.833 --> 30:19.541
If you touch him again,
I'll file a police complaint.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.208
- Hello.
- Viraj.

30:36.166 --> 30:38.500
Viraj, I was not aware of all this.

30:39.500 --> 30:40.583
I'm new to this town.

30:41.583 --> 30:43.041
We are not even friends.

30:43.416 --> 30:45.958
What would anyone else think if you
follow them like that and take pictures?

30:48.250 --> 30:50.500
- I'm really sorry.
- I love you.

30:53.833 --> 30:56.666
What are you doing?
Don't insult. Say sorry.

30:56.750 --> 30:57.833
It's love at first sight.

31:01.041 --> 31:03.583
Sister, I'm really sorry.

31:05.208 --> 31:06.625
I just found out his true colors.

31:06.833 --> 31:08.708
You can file a complaint if you want to.

31:08.916 --> 31:10.291
I'm really sorry.

31:10.625 --> 31:11.625
You…

31:11.708 --> 31:15.125
My photography mentor
used to say something.

31:15.750 --> 31:17.416
"Every photo we capture
must tell a story."

31:17.750 --> 31:20.208
I didn't understand the
meaning until I met you.

31:20.666 --> 31:21.833
Do you understand?

31:23.166 --> 31:25.583
When I clicked your picture…

31:26.416 --> 31:27.708
I found a story.

31:29.125 --> 31:29.958
My story.

31:30.500 --> 31:31.375
Our story.

31:31.875 --> 31:33.250
How I met you?

31:33.625 --> 31:35.458
How I fell in love with you?
How did we end up marrying?

31:35.666 --> 31:37.583
The story I'm going to tell
our kids and their kids.

31:41.625 --> 31:42.458
Cam…

31:42.541 --> 31:48.416
<i>I thought my first interaction</i>
<i>with her must begin with the truth.</i>

31:53.333 --> 31:54.458
Camera, dude!

31:55.041 --> 31:57.208
- It's with my wife.
- To hell with you.

32:01.208 --> 32:02.583
- 35mm.
- What's that?

32:02.833 --> 32:04.208
He will use that lens.

32:05.583 --> 32:07.833
If you don't find the
camera the girl took,

32:08.833 --> 32:10.291
he will use a 35mm rod.

32:10.833 --> 32:12.166
Give me a 35mm lens.

32:13.250 --> 32:15.291
What to do now?
I can't find her anywhere.

32:16.458 --> 32:20.541
A prime lens is a lens that has
a fixed focal length. Prime lenses are…

32:20.625 --> 32:21.750
Did you check in our studio?

32:22.041 --> 32:23.916
They offer a narrow field of view.

32:24.000 --> 32:24.916
Hi, Uncle.

32:25.291 --> 32:27.708
Hey, Varsha.
What a pleasant surprise!

32:27.791 --> 32:28.875
Why did she come here?

32:29.250 --> 32:30.166
Yes.

32:31.916 --> 32:35.000
I just wanted to come
and say hi to you and take some printouts.

32:36.458 --> 32:37.666
Seriously, are you laughing?

32:40.750 --> 32:42.458
We are done.

32:42.875 --> 32:46.166
I will go and join my uncle's tea estate.
You join Gopi's Xerox shop.

32:47.250 --> 32:48.541
You. Come here.

32:49.041 --> 32:50.666
- Me?
- You. Come

32:50.750 --> 32:51.625
He is calling you.

32:52.666 --> 32:54.000
You and I are not related.

32:54.333 --> 32:55.833
Don't reveal anything about me.

32:56.375 --> 32:57.416
- He is coming, sir.
- Sir.

32:57.666 --> 32:58.875
This fellow only, sir.

32:58.958 --> 32:59.791
Viraj.

33:00.083 --> 33:01.500
She needs a few printouts.

33:02.083 --> 33:03.125
Don't worry, Varsha.

33:03.208 --> 33:05.333
- Go with him. He will help you.
- Thank you, Uncle.

33:05.625 --> 33:06.500
See you.

33:08.833 --> 33:09.875
So, students…

33:09.958 --> 33:11.708
Prime lenses are
often used for the following…

33:11.791 --> 33:12.708
- Hey.
- This way…

33:12.791 --> 33:15.875
- Low light photography…
- Dude, tell me what happened.

33:15.958 --> 33:18.125
Hey, dude.

33:18.750 --> 33:19.583
Here.

33:25.500 --> 33:26.416
I'm sorry.

33:26.541 --> 33:28.000
I didn't know that
our boss was your uncle.

33:28.333 --> 33:30.333
Would you have spoken
that way, if you knew?

33:33.000 --> 33:34.208
You're lying, right?

33:40.666 --> 33:41.583
Take prints.

33:50.208 --> 33:51.750
I don't believe in love at first sight.

33:52.708 --> 33:53.625
Like you.

33:54.375 --> 33:55.583
Not just love at first sight.

33:57.083 --> 33:58.583
In fact, I don't believe in love,

33:59.625 --> 34:01.416
marriage, or even kids.

34:08.541 --> 34:09.500
May I know, why?

34:14.375 --> 34:15.750
Why the hell are you involving kids?

34:15.833 --> 34:17.250
They've every right to know.

34:17.500 --> 34:18.500
Where were you?

34:18.833 --> 34:20.583
You were never there for us.

34:27.708 --> 34:28.583
Varsha!

34:29.875 --> 34:31.541
Pack your luggage.

34:32.458 --> 34:34.541
You're going to Coonoor
to stay with Mahendar Uncle.

34:47.208 --> 34:48.083
Prints?

34:56.583 --> 34:58.041
My parents are getting divorced.

35:00.416 --> 35:05.458
Probably because they thought we had
enough love or because we were grown up.

35:06.500 --> 35:07.333
I don't know.

35:09.375 --> 35:13.666
They were together for us all these years,
now they're parting ways for themselves.

35:17.166 --> 35:18.375
This is the story behind me.

35:20.083 --> 35:21.833
Not as beautiful as you assumed.

35:26.083 --> 35:27.458
These are wonderful pictures.

35:29.375 --> 35:31.125
If you think they can help your career…

35:32.458 --> 35:33.333
Go ahead.

35:36.500 --> 35:37.375
All the best.

35:44.083 --> 35:45.083
You are offering them to me to use.

35:47.750 --> 35:49.208
We're not even friends, right?

35:52.041 --> 35:52.958
You don't mind?

35:54.916 --> 35:56.291
I will be here for two weeks.

35:57.125 --> 35:59.000
If you can press pause
on your love story.

35:59.708 --> 36:00.708
We could be friends.

36:08.500 --> 36:09.333
Yes!

36:10.625 --> 36:11.916
<i>Were you just friends?</i>

36:13.666 --> 36:16.708
<i>Your mom asked me</i>
<i>to pause the love story, not to end it.</i>

36:17.000 --> 36:19.875
<i>So for the time being,</i>
<i>I was in love with her friendship.</i>

36:33.500 --> 36:35.375
<i>Your mom's attachment circle is so tiny.</i>

36:36.500 --> 36:38.083
<i>I somehow managed to enter it.</i>

36:40.083 --> 36:42.583
<i>Poor Pluto, couldn't.</i>

36:43.875 --> 36:45.375
<i>Yeah, your mom didn't like dogs at all.</i>

36:58.083 --> 36:59.958
- How is it?
- Amazing food.

37:00.083 --> 37:02.458
- Yeah.
- Really nice. It's not at all spicy.

37:06.250 --> 37:07.125
Are you alright?

37:11.375 --> 37:12.291
I think…

37:17.666 --> 37:18.958
Uncle, just try this.

37:19.041 --> 37:20.875
It's so good. Delicious.

37:21.458 --> 37:22.291
Just try.

37:23.208 --> 37:24.166
It's lovely.

37:33.375 --> 37:36.125
Excuse me, I need to use the washroom.

37:36.333 --> 37:37.333
- Okay.
- I will join you.

37:45.750 --> 37:46.625
Come.

37:51.708 --> 37:52.583
What are you doing here?

37:55.875 --> 37:56.875
Did you get it?

37:58.416 --> 38:00.125
- Open it.
- Wait.

38:18.208 --> 38:20.375
One for me, one for you.

38:21.791 --> 38:24.541
<i>Just determine inside and see…</i>

38:25.958 --> 38:30.458
<i>It will be done just like that</i>

38:31.625 --> 38:34.083
<i>Your dream has to come behind…</i>

38:35.875 --> 38:40.125
<i>Following you like a shadow</i>

38:40.708 --> 38:45.000
<i>Listen to the thunders</i>

38:45.541 --> 38:50.041
<i>Stretch your hands for the raindrops</i>

38:50.375 --> 38:53.875
<i>Like seven colors</i>

38:53.958 --> 38:59.125
<i>Hundred years</i>
<i>You have to flourish</i>

39:05.958 --> 39:09.708
Performing the same song on a grand stage
will drive the audience wild!

39:10.416 --> 39:11.291
Not really.

39:11.916 --> 39:13.708
I wrote this song during my childhood.

39:15.458 --> 39:17.250
My mom doesn't like all this.

39:18.083 --> 39:19.458
Please sing for me once.

39:21.750 --> 39:23.708
If I sing again, I will fall in love.

39:27.625 --> 39:28.458
With the song.

39:32.791 --> 39:35.166
Leave me!
I said leave me!

39:36.708 --> 39:39.083
Let go of me!
Just leave me.

39:39.458 --> 39:40.291
What the hell?

39:46.500 --> 39:47.333
Damn it!

39:47.416 --> 39:49.041
You've made a scene in front of everyone.

39:49.125 --> 39:51.708
Aren't you ashamed of your behavior?
Don't you care about your reputation?

39:51.916 --> 39:53.166
What the hell did I do?

39:53.916 --> 39:55.666
I saw you flirting with that bloody woman.

39:55.916 --> 39:57.083
Do you care about that?

39:57.833 --> 39:59.625
She is just a friend of mine, damn it!

40:44.208 --> 40:46.791
Okay. Are you okay?

40:48.250 --> 40:49.166
You always lie…

40:52.625 --> 40:53.458
Who's there?

40:54.083 --> 40:55.125
Hey…

41:05.208 --> 41:06.750
Stay here. I'll see you tomorrow.

41:08.291 --> 41:11.583
Pigs travel in groups,

41:12.083 --> 41:14.333
- but the lion hunts alone.
- Come on.

41:14.958 --> 41:16.583
This way… to your right!

41:56.583 --> 42:00.750
<i>How did my attention turn on you</i>

42:00.833 --> 42:04.208
<i>Like afresh</i>

42:05.083 --> 42:10.625
<i>When did this magic happen?</i>
<i>Like really crazy</i>

42:11.291 --> 42:13.500
<i>Oh once upon a time</i>

42:13.583 --> 42:15.458
<i>It feels like a story</i>

42:15.750 --> 42:20.500
<i>And it’s just starting</i>
<i>What happens in the end?</i>

42:20.583 --> 42:21.708
<i>It won’t tell me</i>

42:21.958 --> 42:26.250
<i>It’s like a whirlpool</i>
<i>And it dragged me into it</i>

42:26.333 --> 42:31.041
<i>Even before I’m drowned in it</i>
<i>It’s tying a knot around you and me</i>

42:31.125 --> 42:35.166
<i>I won’t leave you my darling</i>

42:35.250 --> 42:39.125
<i>If I leave, can I survive?</i>

42:39.583 --> 42:43.750
<i>Shall I pair up with you without leaving?</i>

42:43.833 --> 42:48.000
<i>You won’t leave me, even if I ask you to</i>

42:54.833 --> 42:56.166
I have to tell you something.

42:56.250 --> 42:57.666
Me too. New camera.

42:58.208 --> 43:02.375
Canon 550D. Rs 45,000.
Finally, I bought it.

43:02.791 --> 43:06.541
Check the image quality, madam.
Eighteen megapixels.

43:06.625 --> 43:07.708
Single-lens reflex!

43:07.875 --> 43:10.291
If I try harder,
I can see the stars as well.

43:12.375 --> 43:14.000
I wish for all the blessings for Pluto.

43:15.041 --> 43:15.875
What does that mean?

43:16.041 --> 43:19.708
It means a rich family has taken him.

43:22.125 --> 43:23.041
Did you sell him?

43:23.250 --> 43:24.291
No, I didn't.

43:25.375 --> 43:26.333
They only paid me.

43:27.791 --> 43:30.875
Anyway,
I can't afford him in this position.

43:31.416 --> 43:33.541
There he has a big house,
and people to take care of him.

43:33.833 --> 43:34.791
He will be very happy.

43:39.166 --> 43:44.041
Big house, people, cars, money.

43:45.500 --> 43:47.125
Maybe he doesn't want all of them.

43:48.375 --> 43:49.833
Do you know how rich I am?

43:52.916 --> 43:53.791
Let's say…

43:54.833 --> 43:56.958
If I loved you and came with you.

43:57.833 --> 44:01.833
Will you leave me, just like him?

44:02.416 --> 44:03.583
By saying you can't afford me?

44:06.250 --> 44:07.666
What's the connection?

44:09.416 --> 44:10.333
Responsibility.

44:12.500 --> 44:13.916
You have love…

44:15.333 --> 44:16.333
But no responsibility.

44:17.958 --> 44:19.208
Why are you taking it personally?

44:20.000 --> 44:21.250
You don't even like him.

44:22.083 --> 44:25.500
I thought the same until I came here.

44:30.875 --> 44:32.041
What does it mean, leaving like that?

44:33.666 --> 44:34.958
It means I'm leaving.

44:36.083 --> 44:37.375
It means I won't return.

44:52.625 --> 44:54.125
<i>Mom and I had a disagreement.</i>

44:54.458 --> 44:57.625
<i>Her parents had</i>
<i>a significant disagreement.</i>

44:58.041 --> 44:59.166
<i>Mom was hurt.</i>

45:56.416 --> 45:57.375
Why did you come?

45:57.750 --> 46:00.166
Why did you come to Coonoor?

46:01.041 --> 46:04.125
Because of my ill fate.
I didn't know you'd be there.

46:04.958 --> 46:07.083
But, I came knowing
that you'd be here.

46:07.625 --> 46:08.833
Why did it take so long?

46:09.958 --> 46:11.458
Because of Pluto.

46:12.500 --> 46:16.208
I would've come earlier,
if I knew you'd hug me like this.

46:17.291 --> 46:21.166
Will you go if I let you?

46:30.666 --> 46:33.000
Is this friendship?

46:37.958 --> 46:39.083
Is this called love?

46:45.958 --> 46:46.791
No.

46:47.958 --> 46:49.208
This is called love!

47:39.416 --> 47:40.291
Sir…

47:42.875 --> 47:43.708
Thank you.

47:44.416 --> 47:45.333
Get the check.

47:52.666 --> 47:53.583
Viraj.

47:56.416 --> 47:57.416
What do you do?

47:58.083 --> 47:59.750
I'm a photographer.

48:00.541 --> 48:01.375
How much do they pay?

48:03.583 --> 48:08.125
Like for a photo or a month.
How much do they pay?

48:14.291 --> 48:15.125
What?

48:16.875 --> 48:17.791
Is it that disgraceful?

48:23.250 --> 48:24.083
Leave it.

48:25.083 --> 48:26.708
Where do you stay?

48:26.791 --> 48:28.666
At Thane.

48:29.333 --> 48:32.333
We live at Malabar Hill.

48:33.541 --> 48:36.666
How far is Thane from Malabar Hill?

48:37.583 --> 48:40.708
Roughly 35 to 40 kilometers, I assume.

48:43.208 --> 48:46.625
- And from Coonoor to our house?
- Mom!

48:46.708 --> 48:50.541
What? He should know
the distance between us, right?

48:53.041 --> 48:54.708
- Ma'am, check.
- Give it to him.

48:55.166 --> 48:56.458
- Okay, ma'am
- Mom this is too much.

48:57.333 --> 48:59.625
- You invited him. So, you should pay.
- Sir.

49:00.791 --> 49:03.791
So, he can't even afford the food we ate?

49:04.000 --> 49:05.875
I can't believe it.
What is he up to?

49:10.458 --> 49:14.875
- I will go check on Pluto once.
- Please, I need five minutes.

49:17.000 --> 49:17.916
Thank you, Viraj.

49:26.416 --> 49:28.083
What are you trying to prove?

49:28.833 --> 49:31.708
That he is after your money.

49:33.333 --> 49:35.916
Do you think love and marriage are a joke?

49:36.750 --> 49:39.333
How much should one
analyze before getting married?

49:40.541 --> 49:43.958
Without even considering his
background and financial status…

49:44.375 --> 49:47.166
You considered everything
and got married, right?

49:47.791 --> 49:49.958
Did that stop you from getting a divorce?

49:52.791 --> 49:57.375
My failed marriage doesn't become a reason

49:57.625 --> 49:59.625
for you to love someone random.

50:00.375 --> 50:03.500
At least I'm crying in a bungalow.

50:05.208 --> 50:08.333
You'd grieve on the roads
if you married him.

50:20.583 --> 50:21.500
What?

50:23.291 --> 50:24.625
He must've left long ago.

50:26.583 --> 50:27.500
Pay the bill.

50:28.541 --> 50:29.375
Let's go home.

50:34.375 --> 50:35.291
Sorry.

50:44.833 --> 50:45.666
Viraj…

50:47.916 --> 50:51.000
People tip 200 rupees in the hotel.

50:51.083 --> 50:52.083
- Thank you, sir,
- Thank you.

50:52.791 --> 50:55.000
This is a tip.
I've paid the bill already.

51:00.541 --> 51:03.541
Don't mistake me for a rich guy.

51:04.291 --> 51:06.375
I was skeptical about paying the bill.

51:06.583 --> 51:08.083
It was my monthly salary.

51:08.875 --> 51:10.833
Luckily, I received it yesterday.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.916
I managed to pay it
due to sheer luck today.

51:18.166 --> 51:19.333
But, five years later,

51:20.416 --> 51:21.833
it'll be because of my hard work.

51:26.875 --> 51:31.833
Ma'am, it is 1200 kilometers
from Coonoor to here.

51:33.958 --> 51:37.708
It took a couple of trains, one bus,
and three autos to reach here.

51:38.875 --> 51:41.250
Tomorrow, it might take just an hour.

51:43.416 --> 51:46.791
I paid today's bill
with my entire monthly salary.

51:48.708 --> 51:53.166
But after I set up my own studio,
I may earn this amount in an hour.

51:56.875 --> 52:01.916
You are measuring
our distance in kilometers.

52:03.250 --> 52:04.333
I measure it with time.

52:05.875 --> 52:07.083
Your distance will never change.

52:08.958 --> 52:11.375
But my time will.

52:16.916 --> 52:17.791
Varsha.

52:18.500 --> 52:20.458
Every single word your mom said is true.

52:22.291 --> 52:25.208
I really am a poor guy.

52:27.458 --> 52:31.416
All I have is a two-acre
farm from my father.

52:34.083 --> 52:40.041
If you come with me, I'm clueless
about how to take care of you.

52:44.875 --> 52:45.708
But…

52:48.125 --> 52:49.250
If you are with me…

52:51.166 --> 52:53.333
I feel like I can manage anything.

52:57.625 --> 52:58.541
In fact,

53:00.625 --> 53:02.166
I will win over the world.

53:06.250 --> 53:07.083
Varsha…

53:08.708 --> 53:09.583
Will you marry me?

53:16.541 --> 53:21.083
You, me, and Pluto.
That's enough!

53:27.125 --> 53:29.166
Thank you guys.
Thank you so much.

53:32.833 --> 53:35.291
Well, this song
is dedicated to my husband.

53:35.666 --> 53:37.833
It's my third anniversary.

53:38.041 --> 53:39.041
Congratulations!

53:40.291 --> 53:42.333
Thank you, but he is late as usual.

53:43.166 --> 53:45.875
This song,
I wrote in my mother tongue, Telugu.

53:46.083 --> 53:48.083
And… I hope you guys like it.

53:49.333 --> 53:50.250
Ready?

53:52.500 --> 53:53.416
Here we go.

54:03.833 --> 54:08.416
<i>Won't my life go bonkers, my dear</i>

54:09.333 --> 54:14.000
<i>If you bind beauty to yourself, my dear</i>

54:14.833 --> 54:19.875
<i>I’m still in the dream, my dear</i>

54:20.333 --> 54:27.166
<i>He keeps saying this</i>
<i>And doesn’t leave me all day</i>

54:27.250 --> 54:32.041
<i>Hey, he keeps asking for a kiss</i>
<i>And I find him cute</i>

54:33.000 --> 54:37.583
<i>When he says my feet shouldn’t touch</i>
<i>The ground, I find him cute</i>

54:38.625 --> 54:44.083
<i>When he is carrying me on his back,</i>
<i>I find him cute</i>

54:44.166 --> 54:48.333
<i>Even in anger, I find him cute</i>

55:14.041 --> 55:17.000
<i>While sleeping on your lap</i>

55:19.666 --> 55:22.708
<i>While caressing your hair</i>

55:25.208 --> 55:28.291
<i>I will become a kid</i>

55:30.708 --> 55:33.291
<i>I will smile silently</i>

55:33.375 --> 55:38.750
<i>True, I asked for half of you</i>

55:38.916 --> 55:45.500
<i>But you put the entire</i>
<i>World in front of me</i>

55:57.916 --> 55:59.666
<i>- Justin.</i>
- Tell me.

56:00.541 --> 56:01.708
<i>- You have to sell my land.</i>
- What?

56:02.791 --> 56:04.041
<i>And come to Mumbai.</i>

56:04.708 --> 56:05.708
<i>We're starting a studio.</i>

56:06.791 --> 56:07.625
What happened?

56:07.708 --> 56:09.333
<i>I will explain everything</i>
<i>after you come here.</i>

56:42.916 --> 56:45.625
<i>Eyes without tears</i>

56:48.375 --> 56:51.583
<i>Would suffice if those were yours</i>

56:53.958 --> 56:56.875
<i>Watching your smile</i>

56:59.375 --> 57:02.083
<i>My eyes are dampened</i>

57:02.166 --> 57:07.666
<i>I asked for a shoulder to lean</i>

57:07.750 --> 57:13.791
<i>You spread the sky and walked me</i>

57:14.666 --> 57:19.541
<i>Won't my life go bonkers, my dear</i>

57:20.166 --> 57:24.666
<i>If you bind beauty to yourself, my dear</i>

57:25.583 --> 57:30.625
<i>I’m still in the dream, my dear</i>

57:31.083 --> 57:37.833
<i>He keeps saying this</i>
<i>And doesn’t leave me all day</i>

57:37.916 --> 57:42.833
<i>Hey, he keeps asking for a kiss,</i>
<i>And I find him cute</i>

57:43.875 --> 57:48.458
<i>When he says my feet shouldn’t touch</i>
<i>The ground, I find him cute</i>

57:49.375 --> 57:54.916
<i>When he is carrying me on his back,</i>
<i>I find him cute</i>

57:55.000 --> 57:59.166
<i>Even in anger, I find him cute</i>

58:05.416 --> 58:06.458
What are you thinking?

58:07.291 --> 58:08.958
Nothing, just thinking about
if we'll have a boy or girl child…

58:09.541 --> 58:10.916
Will they get your nose or mine?

58:11.333 --> 58:12.166
What does that mean?

58:33.541 --> 58:34.375
What happened?

58:35.583 --> 58:37.541
I thought I was clear
about the kids, Viraj.

58:38.750 --> 58:41.333
What did you say,
when you asked me for marriage?

58:42.000 --> 58:44.625
You and I
and we don't need anyone else.

58:45.208 --> 58:47.166
- Didn't you say that?
- Yes, I did.

58:47.250 --> 58:48.541
Then, what is this now?

58:49.416 --> 58:50.500
Kids are not outsiders.

58:51.375 --> 58:52.458
They are our extension.

58:53.291 --> 58:54.666
Wow! Good one!

58:56.625 --> 58:58.791
Do you know how much I love you?

58:59.333 --> 59:05.666
I was ready to go through what
my mom went through in her marriage.

59:06.083 --> 59:07.250
But, as their child.

59:08.125 --> 59:11.916
I'm not ready to let
my children suffer like I have.

59:12.916 --> 59:13.916
What are you trying to say?

59:14.708 --> 59:15.875
That we won't stick together?

59:16.166 --> 59:17.250
Who knows?

59:17.916 --> 59:19.791
It has just been 3 years
since we got married.

59:20.458 --> 59:24.666
Can you promise me that
we will be happy always?

59:26.208 --> 59:28.500
See, you are scared to make a promise.

59:31.250 --> 59:34.291
I'm not scared to make a promise.
I'm scared of your thought process.

59:35.291 --> 59:36.458
No two people will live
without fights and differences.

59:37.291 --> 59:39.083
While I'm anticipating a beautiful future.

59:39.666 --> 59:40.958
You are anticipating troubles?

59:42.583 --> 59:44.250
Do you know what you are talking about?

59:44.541 --> 59:46.333
I'm not saying we will have trouble.

59:47.041 --> 59:49.291
Our kids will have them because of us.

59:49.916 --> 59:56.291
If something goes wrong in
the beautiful future you are foreseeing.

59:56.708 --> 59:58.791
We won't suffer, our kids will.

01:00:04.833 --> 01:00:05.750
You've gone crazy.

01:00:06.916 --> 01:00:07.833
You're mad.

01:00:08.083 --> 01:00:08.916
I…

01:00:09.666 --> 01:00:10.500
Forget it.

01:00:12.250 --> 01:00:13.708
It's my mistake
that I tried to talk to you.

01:00:15.166 --> 01:00:16.250
I made a mistake leaving the studio.

01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:17.458
I should have stayed there.

01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:20.375
Who is stopping you?
Leave!

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.500
Why did you come
if you were so bothered?

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:25.833
You are right!

01:00:26.125 --> 01:00:27.166
Because I was a fool.

01:00:27.916 --> 01:00:29.000
Do whatever you want.

01:00:29.375 --> 01:00:30.541
I made a mistake marrying you!

01:00:57.166 --> 01:00:58.000
I'm sorry.

01:00:59.708 --> 01:01:00.625
Sorry.

01:01:00.750 --> 01:01:02.583
Sorry…

01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:06.250
Was marrying me a mistake?

01:01:11.958 --> 01:01:13.083
Sorry.

01:01:14.375 --> 01:01:16.875
Fine, whatever you say.

01:01:17.250 --> 01:01:18.083
It's up to you.

01:01:18.291 --> 01:01:19.125
Even if you want to…

01:01:20.166 --> 01:01:21.000
Actually, it's up to you.

01:01:21.875 --> 01:01:24.166
Let's see whose nose the kid will get.

01:01:29.083 --> 01:01:30.791
I never believed in love, Viraj.

01:01:32.250 --> 01:01:33.625
But, you proved me wrong.

01:01:37.041 --> 01:01:38.875
I never believed in marriage as well.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.458
But, look where you've brought me.

01:01:46.166 --> 01:01:48.000
I thought of not having kids.

01:01:50.875 --> 01:01:51.750
But, I know…

01:01:52.833 --> 01:01:54.666
you will prove me
wrong once again.

01:01:56.583 --> 01:01:59.125
But, I'm scared Viraj.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:00.833
Trust me.

01:02:02.041 --> 01:02:04.291
This will be
the best decision of our life.

01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:09.375
I'm sure he or she
will bring us a lot of joy.

01:02:10.791 --> 01:02:13.208
- Promise?
- Promise.

01:02:18.416 --> 01:02:19.708
Then, let's get pregnant.

01:02:25.375 --> 01:02:26.291
Do you call this love?

01:02:30.666 --> 01:02:32.000
This is called love.

01:02:49.791 --> 01:02:50.666
And?

01:02:51.208 --> 01:02:52.166
And…

01:02:53.791 --> 01:02:55.916
My world has called me Dad.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000
What about me?

01:02:58.208 --> 01:02:59.375
What happened to me?

01:03:00.958 --> 01:03:01.791
Her!

01:03:03.583 --> 01:03:04.541
Yeah, sorry.

01:03:05.416 --> 01:03:06.250
Her.

01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:07.875
What happened to her?

01:03:15.208 --> 01:03:16.041
Singing.

01:03:17.708 --> 01:03:19.666
She was always very
passionate about singing.

01:03:20.958 --> 01:03:22.291
And she left chasing her passion.

01:03:22.375 --> 01:03:23.208
Wait.

01:03:23.708 --> 01:03:25.208
This doesn't make any sense.

01:03:25.958 --> 01:03:28.250
A girl who despised love and marriage…

01:03:28.625 --> 01:03:31.708
Left everyone for you.

01:03:32.250 --> 01:03:34.583
And when Mahi was born,
she chose her career?

01:03:35.416 --> 01:03:36.291
I don't believe it.

01:03:36.583 --> 01:03:39.041
It wasn't folklore for you
to believe it or not.

01:03:39.791 --> 01:03:41.000
It's a true story.

01:03:41.916 --> 01:03:44.166
Even then. It doesn't add up.

01:03:44.625 --> 01:03:45.791
You're hiding something.

01:03:46.291 --> 01:03:47.125
Tell me the truth.

01:03:53.875 --> 01:03:55.083
Mahi, you asked for Mom's story.

01:03:55.541 --> 01:03:56.375
I told you.

01:03:56.625 --> 01:03:58.125
We are done. Let's leave.

01:03:58.458 --> 01:03:59.291
Pluto.

01:04:07.625 --> 01:04:08.458
I got it.

01:04:08.958 --> 01:04:11.791
There was a time when
you struggled to pay the bill.

01:04:12.250 --> 01:04:15.166
Now you can afford
2000 bucks for just a coffee.

01:04:17.291 --> 01:04:20.791
So, your status might have
shifted your priorities.

01:04:23.666 --> 01:04:24.500
Mahi, let's go.

01:04:25.083 --> 01:04:25.916
Pluto!

01:04:27.583 --> 01:04:31.291
You must have left her
like you left the story.

01:04:33.208 --> 01:04:34.041
Mahi!

01:04:36.833 --> 01:04:40.083
Dad, did you leave Mom?

01:04:46.416 --> 01:04:49.875
I don't care about others,
only my daughter's opinion matters.

01:05:02.250 --> 01:05:03.208
You heard Mom's story.

01:05:04.666 --> 01:05:05.625
Should I tell you Dad's?

01:05:10.375 --> 01:05:14.750
<i>With a lot of beautiful things</i>

01:05:15.041 --> 01:05:19.791
<i>The world is waiting for you</i>

01:05:19.875 --> 01:05:22.125
<i>For your arrival</i>

01:05:22.333 --> 01:05:28.625
<i>The times are waiting with all eyes</i>

01:05:28.708 --> 01:05:33.708
<i>Hoping that someday</i>
<i>You will play tantrums</i>

01:05:34.333 --> 01:05:38.291
<i>I have prepared to shower love on you</i>

01:05:38.375 --> 01:05:43.375
<i>This wind has become my voice</i>

01:05:43.875 --> 01:05:48.750
<i>And kept humming</i>

01:06:08.708 --> 01:06:09.583
He's here…

01:06:11.375 --> 01:06:13.000
It's a baby girl.

01:06:13.666 --> 01:06:14.500
Viraj.

01:06:24.708 --> 01:06:25.625
Dr. Ranjan.

01:06:29.208 --> 01:06:32.750
<i>Your daughter was born with</i>
<i>a condition called Cystic Fibrosis.</i>

01:06:32.958 --> 01:06:34.208
<i>It is a fatal condition.</i>

01:06:34.541 --> 01:06:36.666
<i>She may not live long.</i>

01:06:37.166 --> 01:06:38.375
<i>She was put in an incubator.</i>

01:07:02.083 --> 01:07:03.041
You are here.

01:07:06.166 --> 01:07:07.166
Look at the baby.

01:07:10.125 --> 01:07:15.208
I can't figure out
if she got your nose or mine.

01:07:18.375 --> 01:07:20.541
They're saying
she has some lung disease.

01:07:21.083 --> 01:07:22.333
Apparently, she won't survive.

01:07:24.458 --> 01:07:26.041
Even if I try to feed her…

01:07:26.833 --> 01:07:28.791
they say her heart
might stop beating.

01:07:30.750 --> 01:07:32.750
They're not letting me touch her.

01:07:34.916 --> 01:07:36.666
You promised me, right?

01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:40.291
This will be the best
decision of our life.

01:07:43.083 --> 01:07:47.750
You said this kid will bring us joy.

01:07:49.916 --> 01:07:51.583
I had refused.

01:07:53.416 --> 01:07:55.208
Why did this happen?

01:07:55.916 --> 01:07:56.750
I'm sorry.

01:07:57.458 --> 01:08:02.583
<i>- I asked for beautiful raindrops</i>
- I'm sorry.

01:08:02.666 --> 01:08:06.083
<i>Without knowing a thunder would strike</i>

01:08:06.166 --> 01:08:11.041
<i>- I called the seven sparkles of colors</i>
- I'm sorry.

01:08:11.125 --> 01:08:15.791
<i>But the black has joined like destiny</i>

01:08:16.375 --> 01:08:22.625
<i>Anyways the fault is mine</i>
<i>I showed you dreams</i>

01:08:23.041 --> 01:08:25.625
<i>But I gave you sorrow</i>

01:08:26.458 --> 01:08:31.583
<i>I won’t ask forgiveness of the heart</i>

01:08:31.666 --> 01:08:36.708
<i>It won’t happen again with my knowledge</i>

01:08:36.791 --> 01:08:41.750
<i>The eyes are left with tears dried off</i>

01:08:41.833 --> 01:08:47.083
<i>White would be the correcting agent</i>

01:08:50.416 --> 01:08:51.291
Mahi, wake up.

01:08:56.458 --> 01:08:57.500
Mahi, wake up.

01:09:23.833 --> 01:09:24.666
Hey…

01:09:30.625 --> 01:09:32.250
You go home.
I will look after the baby.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.625
It's okay. I'm fine.

01:09:35.125 --> 01:09:37.583
I'm not saying it for you.
I'm saying it for her.

01:09:44.125 --> 01:09:46.250
She hasn't moved since yesterday.

01:09:46.541 --> 01:09:47.708
Talk to her

01:09:47.875 --> 01:09:50.583
She will return to normalcy
only if you talk through it.

01:09:56.416 --> 01:09:58.250
It's been four months since
you spoke to me properly.

01:10:01.416 --> 01:10:02.291
Trust me.

01:10:04.125 --> 01:10:05.041
Nothing will happen to her.

01:10:07.166 --> 01:10:08.166
I will do something.

01:10:12.875 --> 01:10:14.250
Talk to me Varsha, please!

01:10:17.083 --> 01:10:19.416
I wish I hadn't come to Coonoor.

01:10:23.583 --> 01:10:25.666
I wish I hadn't met you.

01:10:28.291 --> 01:10:31.000
I wish I hadn't fallen in love with you.

01:10:34.166 --> 01:10:36.583
I wish I hadn't married you.

01:10:38.958 --> 01:10:41.000
When you asked for kids,

01:10:42.208 --> 01:10:44.166
I wish I hadn't agreed with you.

01:10:48.166 --> 01:10:50.458
I wish Mahi hadn't been born to me!

01:10:54.958 --> 01:10:56.416
Don't tell me anymore.

01:10:57.083 --> 01:10:58.916
Let's go home, Dad.

01:11:19.958 --> 01:11:20.791
Mahi!

01:11:22.041 --> 01:11:22.875
Mahi!

01:11:22.958 --> 01:11:23.958
Mahi. Please, look at me.

01:11:26.041 --> 01:11:26.875
Mahi.

01:11:26.958 --> 01:11:28.000
- Mahi, please…
- One minute.

01:11:39.083 --> 01:11:40.583
Viraj, what did I do?

01:11:42.750 --> 01:11:44.500
Why isn't she talking to me?

01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:48.708
She imagined you as her mother.

01:11:49.416 --> 01:11:50.291
So…

01:11:50.541 --> 01:11:51.458
So…

01:11:52.750 --> 01:11:55.458
She is upset with me
because I disowned her.

01:11:57.375 --> 01:11:58.208
But…

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.875
Tell her I'm not the real mother.

01:12:02.416 --> 01:12:03.250
Don't worry.

01:12:03.375 --> 01:12:04.583
She will be fine by tomorrow.

01:12:04.833 --> 01:12:06.541
Can you please call me,
once she is alright?

01:12:06.750 --> 01:12:08.000
She has my number.

01:12:10.958 --> 01:12:11.791
Viraj…

01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:16.208
I don't know if I can ask you this.

01:12:18.625 --> 01:12:19.666
But, if you don't mind.

01:12:20.208 --> 01:12:22.041
May I know what happened later?

01:14:01.958 --> 01:14:02.875
I'm…

01:14:03.375 --> 01:14:04.958
I'm really sorry.

01:14:06.416 --> 01:14:08.000
I wasn't aware of all of this…

01:14:09.083 --> 01:14:10.208
It's okay. What can you do?

01:14:10.666 --> 01:14:11.625
Some stories are like that.

01:14:12.916 --> 01:14:14.791
I'm actually really sorry.

01:14:15.625 --> 01:14:16.583
Please, don't cry.

01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:18.708
It's been years.

01:14:19.208 --> 01:14:20.125
We moved on.

01:14:20.541 --> 01:14:21.416
Don't worry.

01:14:26.833 --> 01:14:27.666
Pluto, get in.

01:14:28.708 --> 01:14:30.291
Pluto, get in.

01:14:33.416 --> 01:14:37.541
<i>Shards of dreams</i>

01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:41.083
<i>- Now fallen apart</i>
- We should get going.

01:14:41.166 --> 01:14:42.000
Yeah.

01:14:45.208 --> 01:14:48.666
<i>Echoes of you</i>

01:14:49.375 --> 01:14:54.125
<i>Still haunt my heart</i>

01:14:54.583 --> 01:14:55.833
Surprise!

01:15:02.125 --> 01:15:06.000
<i>In the pain</i>

01:15:06.958 --> 01:15:07.791
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:15:07.875 --> 01:15:12.291
<i>Where our love used to be</i>

01:15:14.333 --> 01:15:20.625
<i>Lies the ghost of you and me</i>

01:15:27.708 --> 01:15:29.375
- What happened?
- Nothing.

01:15:29.833 --> 01:15:30.666
I'm fine.

01:15:33.375 --> 01:15:34.250
What happened to Mahi?

01:15:34.916 --> 01:15:35.750
Everything is alright.

01:15:36.125 --> 01:15:37.000
Okay…

01:16:26.208 --> 01:16:27.083
Yashna!

01:16:28.083 --> 01:16:28.958
Yashna!

01:16:30.291 --> 01:16:31.125
Ya--

01:16:32.625 --> 01:16:35.291
Everyone is asking for the bride.

01:16:38.458 --> 01:16:39.375
What are you doing?

01:16:39.958 --> 01:16:40.875
Nothing, Mom.

01:16:41.208 --> 01:16:42.083
I'm going.

01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:49.916
You can't see her.

01:16:50.416 --> 01:16:52.125
I have every right.
She is my wife.

01:16:52.208 --> 01:16:53.208
No, she is not.

01:16:53.708 --> 01:16:55.583
She doesn't even remember you.

01:16:59.541 --> 01:17:01.291
She doesn't remember
that she is married,

01:17:02.333 --> 01:17:04.500
and has a kid.

01:17:04.833 --> 01:17:08.000
In fact, she doesn't remember
that we are divorced.

01:17:10.625 --> 01:17:12.416
She forgot everything.

01:17:16.625 --> 01:17:20.625
<i>Shards of dreams…</i>

01:17:21.250 --> 01:17:22.375
<i>Traumatic amnesia.</i>

01:17:22.666 --> 01:17:24.208
<i>We didn't think she would survive.</i>

01:17:24.708 --> 01:17:25.958
<i>You should thank Dr. Aravind.</i>

01:17:26.458 --> 01:17:30.208
We do not have control over
recovering lost memories.

01:17:32.333 --> 01:17:36.166
<i>Still haunt my heart</i>

01:17:40.833 --> 01:17:41.666
Why did you do this?

01:18:05.458 --> 01:18:12.250
<i>Shards of dreams, now fallen apart</i>

01:18:12.833 --> 01:18:17.583
<i>Echoes of you still haunt my heart</i>

01:18:18.875 --> 01:18:21.166
Somebody, please help!

01:18:30.041 --> 01:18:34.875
<i>Shards of dreams, now fallen apart</i>

01:18:41.458 --> 01:18:46.333
<i>Echoes of you still haunt my heart</i>

01:18:47.375 --> 01:18:48.750
She wanted a divorce.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.666
She spoke about it two days ago.

01:18:53.833 --> 01:18:54.833
Meanwhile…

01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:05.458
<i>She has suffered enough for loving you.</i>

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.666
<i>This is another life for her.</i>

01:19:09.416 --> 01:19:11.083
<i>Leave her now at least.</i>

01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:12.333
<i>Please.</i>

01:19:12.916 --> 01:19:13.791
<i>Please.</i>

01:20:03.541 --> 01:20:05.208
I don't know which God she prayed to.

01:20:07.458 --> 01:20:09.083
But, she prayed for it firmly.

01:20:12.916 --> 01:20:15.500
I wanted to see her without tears.

01:20:18.916 --> 01:20:19.875
But, I turned into the sole
reason for those tears.

01:20:26.250 --> 01:20:28.250
We will never come into her life again.

01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:34.708
Hi, Dad.

01:20:36.250 --> 01:20:37.583
This is Yashna.

01:20:37.958 --> 01:20:41.958
<i>Shards of dreams</i>

01:20:43.125 --> 01:20:46.000
<i>Now fallen apart</i>

01:20:53.083 --> 01:20:57.833
<i>Echoes of you still haunt my heart</i>

01:21:24.750 --> 01:21:25.583
Jeez man!

01:21:26.041 --> 01:21:28.208
Does anyone in this house
intend to speak? Or…

01:21:28.791 --> 01:21:29.875
Is it entirely dumb charades?

01:21:32.583 --> 01:21:34.833
Hindi, English, Telugu?

01:21:35.458 --> 01:21:36.708
Say something.

01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:40.041
God, make someone open
their mouth in this house.

01:21:42.916 --> 01:21:44.291
That was quick.

01:21:45.041 --> 01:21:47.208
You continue with your cold war.

01:21:47.291 --> 01:21:51.083
Let it be the paperboy or the milkman,
I will make friends with them.

01:21:51.416 --> 01:21:52.583
You just keep watching.

01:21:53.166 --> 01:21:54.000
Yeah!

01:22:00.750 --> 01:22:01.875
Hallelujah.

01:22:02.666 --> 01:22:03.500
Justin?

01:22:03.958 --> 01:22:05.166
Yashna!

01:22:07.583 --> 01:22:08.916
How do you know me?

01:22:12.375 --> 01:22:13.291
How do you know me?

01:22:13.458 --> 01:22:18.333
You're exactly like I imagined
when Viraj was narrating the story.

01:22:20.416 --> 01:22:22.458
By the way, how do you know me?

01:22:22.541 --> 01:22:23.541
That…

01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:25.333
Move aside.

01:22:25.541 --> 01:22:26.500
How is Mahi?

01:23:02.833 --> 01:23:03.708
Yashna!

01:23:09.208 --> 01:23:10.083
Yashna!

01:23:10.875 --> 01:23:11.750
How do you know this address?

01:23:12.250 --> 01:23:14.666
I got this address from your office.

01:23:17.583 --> 01:23:18.666
How's Mahi?

01:23:20.708 --> 01:23:21.541
She is fine.

01:23:22.708 --> 01:23:26.416
Since last night,
I have been researching her condition.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:31.333
As I read…

01:23:32.708 --> 01:23:35.041
Mahi won't make--

01:23:35.125 --> 01:23:36.000
That's what they exactly said.

01:23:38.041 --> 01:23:39.125
They put her in an incubator.

01:23:40.375 --> 01:23:41.583
They said she couldn't leave the hospital.

01:23:42.958 --> 01:23:43.791
You know what I did?

01:23:45.666 --> 01:23:47.041
I went home and prepared her room.

01:23:48.750 --> 01:23:50.291
I believed firmly
that she would come home.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.000
In a week, she was home.

01:23:56.875 --> 01:23:58.125
They said she couldn't join the nursery.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:01.791
I got her admission
to the school till her tenth.

01:24:03.250 --> 01:24:04.250
Now, she is first in the class.

01:24:09.791 --> 01:24:11.500
They said it’ll be a miracle
if she makes it beyond three

01:24:14.458 --> 01:24:15.833
Now that miracle's age is six.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.541
Similarly, I have planned
a beautiful 65 years of her life.

01:24:22.583 --> 01:24:25.166
How will I let her go if she leaves?

01:24:40.916 --> 01:24:43.833
I got this thread for Mahi's well-being.

01:24:44.666 --> 01:24:45.666
But, I get it.

01:24:46.208 --> 01:24:47.333
This is for you.

01:24:48.416 --> 01:24:50.791
If you are safe, she remains safe.

01:24:56.208 --> 01:24:57.333
She is lucky to have you!

01:25:03.583 --> 01:25:06.333
What is 65 Roses?

01:25:06.958 --> 01:25:09.041
It’s Cystic Fibrosis!

01:25:11.916 --> 01:25:18.875
One day she overheard me
discussing her condition.

01:25:19.458 --> 01:25:20.708
She couldn't pronounce it properly.

01:25:21.291 --> 01:25:22.375
We never corrected her
and started following her.

01:25:22.875 --> 01:25:25.000
- Can I see her once?
- Not now.

01:25:25.833 --> 01:25:28.750
Please… I won't take much time.
I promise you.

01:25:28.833 --> 01:25:30.333
Please try to understand.

01:25:30.583 --> 01:25:32.083
- She is not in a state…
- Dad…

01:25:48.333 --> 01:25:49.208
Mahi!

01:25:52.375 --> 01:25:53.625
Are you still angry with me?

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:55.166
I'm sorry.

01:25:56.375 --> 01:26:00.458
- Why?
- For my rude behavior.

01:26:00.541 --> 01:26:02.125
Do friends apologize to each other?

01:26:02.541 --> 01:26:04.500
So, are we friends?

01:26:04.916 --> 01:26:05.958
I'm not sure.

01:26:06.458 --> 01:26:09.250
Friends, usually hug and kiss each other…

01:26:27.875 --> 01:26:29.958
You know what?
I have a surprise planned for you.

01:26:31.291 --> 01:26:34.291
We will go out in the evening
and we will have lots of fun.

01:26:35.291 --> 01:26:36.791
When will she return from her school?

01:26:37.458 --> 01:26:38.291
It'll be four.

01:26:38.666 --> 01:26:40.916
- Fine, I will come by five.
- Dentist appointment at five.

01:26:42.125 --> 01:26:43.458
- Then…
- Six to eight, homework.

01:26:43.541 --> 01:26:44.625
Dinner at eight, and nine her bedtime.

01:26:45.208 --> 01:26:46.041
Wow.

01:26:46.916 --> 01:26:48.791
Are you sure?
Is it not possible?

01:26:50.958 --> 01:26:53.000
Dad, tomorrow is Saturday.
Holiday!

01:26:57.666 --> 01:26:58.500
Perfect!

01:26:58.750 --> 01:26:59.833
Nine o'clock, fix.

01:27:00.083 --> 01:27:01.916
I will reserve a table in the Hyatt.

01:27:02.458 --> 01:27:03.375
Please join us.

01:27:03.958 --> 01:27:05.416
I have a surprise planned for her.

01:27:06.541 --> 01:27:08.333
Bye, Mahi.
See you in the evening.

01:27:08.625 --> 01:27:10.083
Sharp nine.
Don't forget.

01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:13.083
- Bye.
- Bye, Yashna.

01:27:13.166 --> 01:27:14.125
See you.

01:27:14.208 --> 01:27:15.166
See you. Love you.

01:27:17.666 --> 01:27:19.250
Bye.

01:27:19.333 --> 01:27:20.250
Bye.

01:27:20.458 --> 01:27:21.375
Bye.

01:27:31.875 --> 01:27:33.041
Why aren't you talking?

01:27:34.625 --> 01:27:35.541
Dumb charades?

01:27:40.375 --> 01:27:41.416
What do you want me to say?

01:27:43.791 --> 01:27:44.958
Are you taking Mahi
to meet her in the evening?

01:27:47.125 --> 01:27:48.000
No chance.

01:27:57.625 --> 01:27:59.416
Dad, my school is that way.

01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:00.583
You aren't going to school today.

01:28:01.750 --> 01:28:02.583
Did you check the schedule?

01:28:02.833 --> 01:28:03.666
What shoots do we have today?

01:28:03.916 --> 01:28:05.208
You have Maxim.

01:28:05.958 --> 01:28:07.333
Amul and I are covering the Goa shoot.

01:28:07.916 --> 01:28:08.958
I will also come to Goa.

01:28:09.208 --> 01:28:10.083
We're taking Mahi with us.

01:28:10.583 --> 01:28:11.500
Goa?

01:28:13.666 --> 01:28:14.833
What about tomorrow?

01:28:14.916 --> 01:28:16.083
Saturday is a holiday.

01:28:17.708 --> 01:28:18.541
Did you forget?

01:28:18.958 --> 01:28:19.833
But…

01:28:21.375 --> 01:28:22.333
Yashna…

01:28:24.375 --> 01:28:26.000
Surprise.

01:28:26.416 --> 01:28:27.916
Viraj, what you're doing is wrong.

01:28:37.875 --> 01:28:38.708
Wrong?

01:28:40.583 --> 01:28:43.541
<i>Because of an accident,</i>
<i>we were out of her life.</i>

01:28:45.625 --> 01:28:46.541
<i>By stopping an accident,</i>

01:28:47.416 --> 01:28:48.750
<i>she came back into our lives.</i>

01:28:49.416 --> 01:28:50.583
<i>She turned up at my house for my daughter</i>

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.750
<i>with just a brief introduction</i>
<i>in the cafe yesterday.</i>

01:28:53.791 --> 01:28:57.833
Would she have come if she knew
that it was her daughter?

01:29:01.541 --> 01:29:03.791
<i>Mahi couldn't cope just</i>
<i>imagining her as her mom.</i>

01:29:04.083 --> 01:29:06.541
<i>Can she take it, if she knew</i>
<i>she is her real mother?</i>

01:29:15.291 --> 01:29:17.041
<i>They are unable to refrain</i>
<i>from meeting each other.</i>

01:29:17.375 --> 01:29:18.916
<i>But, they cannot live together as well.</i>

01:29:25.666 --> 01:29:26.583
<i>Mahi…</i>

01:29:26.875 --> 01:29:27.708
<i>Yashna.</i>

01:29:28.875 --> 01:29:29.750
It's their fate.

01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:33.708
How far will you keep running?

01:29:36.833 --> 01:29:37.666
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:29:43.291 --> 01:29:46.666
<i>Didn't it occur to you to tell me</i>
<i>that Yashna is in Mumbai?</i>

01:29:47.750 --> 01:29:50.083
- Hi!
<i>- She is getting married in a week.</i>

01:29:51.708 --> 01:29:52.541
Hi, Yashna.

01:29:52.833 --> 01:29:55.666
I didn't know how to tell you.

01:29:59.208 --> 01:30:00.041
<i>Great!</i>

01:30:01.708 --> 01:30:02.916
<i>You just asked me how far will I run.</i>

01:30:03.916 --> 01:30:04.875
<i>Just a week.</i>

01:30:05.875 --> 01:30:07.250
<i>And our paths will never cross.</i>

01:30:08.208 --> 01:30:09.333
Brother, this is the plan.

01:30:09.708 --> 01:30:11.541
Here we are planning
for the Pediatric Division.

01:30:11.625 --> 01:30:12.458
Hello?

01:30:12.708 --> 01:30:13.541
<i>Yashna.</i>

01:30:15.375 --> 01:30:16.250
Mahi.

01:30:16.916 --> 01:30:18.375
- Where are you?
- Goa.

01:30:18.791 --> 01:30:22.166
Goa? I waited for you last night.

01:30:22.666 --> 01:30:24.333
Do you know how many
times have I called you?

01:30:24.583 --> 01:30:25.500
I don't know.

01:30:27.208 --> 01:30:28.083
Why don't you know?

01:30:28.166 --> 01:30:30.208
I don't have a phone, Yashna.

01:30:30.291 --> 01:30:32.125
<i>Not you, your Dad. Leave it.</i>
<i>Now, I am telling you to listen.</i>

01:30:32.625 --> 01:30:33.791
Happy birthday, Mahi.

01:30:34.208 --> 01:30:35.875
<i>May you get everything you wished for!</i>

01:30:35.958 --> 01:30:38.125
- Do you remember?
- Of course.

01:30:38.416 --> 01:30:40.333
How can I forget your birthday?

01:30:42.375 --> 01:30:45.000
But, Dad doesn't remember.

01:30:47.833 --> 01:30:49.500
Fine, I will call you later.

01:30:50.333 --> 01:30:51.250
<i>Mahi.</i>

01:30:55.333 --> 01:30:56.250
Is everything okay?

01:30:59.416 --> 01:31:01.541
This hospital will be
the heart of the country.

01:31:02.666 --> 01:31:04.666
In case, we leave for
the US after we get married…

01:31:07.916 --> 01:31:08.875
My brother will look after this place.

01:31:09.916 --> 01:31:11.291
He will be the managing director.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.208
Aravind, I have to leave.

01:31:15.208 --> 01:31:17.125
- Is there any problem?
- Everything is fine.

01:31:17.875 --> 01:31:18.916
But, a bit of urgent work.

01:31:19.458 --> 01:31:21.083
Are you sure?
I can drop you off.

01:31:21.166 --> 01:31:22.500
No, I have the car. Bye.

01:31:38.458 --> 01:31:39.333
Did you take my phone?

01:31:46.541 --> 01:31:47.416
Are you lying?

01:31:49.541 --> 01:31:50.375
Fine.

01:31:50.916 --> 01:31:51.750
Don't tell Dad.

01:32:45.416 --> 01:32:46.250
Yashna.

01:33:04.916 --> 01:33:07.583
I thought you forgot
my birthday for the first time!

01:33:31.166 --> 01:33:33.125
My Ukulele.
Thank you, Dad.

01:33:39.875 --> 01:33:40.750
Mahi, come…

01:33:40.958 --> 01:33:42.625
Dad got a special cake for you.

01:33:58.500 --> 01:33:59.458
Hi, Viraj.

01:34:09.375 --> 01:34:11.500
How did Yashna know Mahi's birthday?

01:34:13.041 --> 01:34:14.333
You just narrated the story.

01:34:14.625 --> 01:34:18.083
Your daughter has told her everything,
including your ATM pin.

01:34:21.083 --> 01:34:22.166
Didn't she figure that out?

01:34:22.416 --> 01:34:23.416
How can she?

01:34:23.916 --> 01:34:26.666
You changed me
as her brother in your story.

01:34:32.625 --> 01:34:35.250
Yashna didn't know that
she came to Coonoor.

01:34:36.833 --> 01:34:39.750
She didn't even know
that my parents were divorced.

01:34:42.125 --> 01:34:45.833
She thinks my dad has been
with me all these years in the U.S.

01:34:46.125 --> 01:34:47.666
He seldom meets my sister.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:49.708
I never liked you.

01:34:50.916 --> 01:34:51.875
Just like my mom.

01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:55.625
I thought she had a tragic life with you.

01:35:00.333 --> 01:35:01.166
What changed?

01:35:18.250 --> 01:35:19.958
I know a great deal about my sister.

01:35:20.916 --> 01:35:22.708
Giving birth to a daughter with you…

01:35:23.333 --> 01:35:25.208
is proof that
she must have been in a happy marriage.

01:35:28.708 --> 01:35:29.541
Please…

01:35:30.125 --> 01:35:33.208
let Yashna be with Mahi
for at least a few days.

01:35:33.750 --> 01:35:36.833
They planned a lot of shopping
and lunch for tomorrow.

01:35:39.208 --> 01:35:43.833
Dimitrov, my diva, from Russia.
Adjust your hair, baby.

01:35:44.083 --> 01:35:44.916
Yeah!

01:35:46.166 --> 01:35:48.833
Dimitrov, you're looking beautiful.

01:35:48.916 --> 01:35:50.791
One more pose.

01:35:50.875 --> 01:35:51.833
Where is Viraj?

01:35:52.083 --> 01:35:54.750
Viraj is dealing with the Gone Girl. Okay?

01:35:54.833 --> 01:35:57.041
One more shot.
One for Putin. One for me.

01:35:57.125 --> 01:35:58.000
No, I won't.

01:35:58.333 --> 01:35:59.750
You're not Viraj.
Where is Viraj?

01:36:00.375 --> 01:36:02.000
You're also not Deepika Padukone!

01:36:03.541 --> 01:36:04.708
How insensitive!

01:36:05.625 --> 01:36:06.541
Excuse me?

01:36:06.875 --> 01:36:08.208
Did you forget me?

01:36:10.875 --> 01:36:12.958
Hey, Pomeranian!

01:36:14.291 --> 01:36:15.458
How can I forget you?

01:36:16.333 --> 01:36:18.541
That reminds me…
Where is your sister?

01:36:39.583 --> 01:36:40.416
Hi, Dad.

01:36:44.500 --> 01:36:45.333
Thank you for today.

01:36:46.958 --> 01:36:50.458
I cannot fathom
how I forgot Mahi's birthday.

01:36:51.916 --> 01:36:52.958
I can never forgive myself.

01:36:55.208 --> 01:36:56.041
Viraj.

01:36:56.750 --> 01:37:01.208
I met with an accident six years ago,
just like yours.

01:37:02.750 --> 01:37:04.541
You just forgot an event.

01:37:05.875 --> 01:37:08.000
I forgot a great deal.

01:37:10.250 --> 01:37:11.708
But, I don't regret anything.

01:37:13.166 --> 01:37:14.000
Do you know why?

01:37:15.958 --> 01:37:20.458
I have my people
who will remember things for me.

01:37:22.666 --> 01:37:27.416
Same way, I remembered this time for you.

01:37:28.458 --> 01:37:30.333
So, chill!

01:37:37.791 --> 01:37:42.250
Why are you profoundly
staring at the sea?

01:37:42.833 --> 01:37:43.833
Phytoplankton Algae.

01:37:45.708 --> 01:37:46.916
Very rarely seen.

01:37:48.541 --> 01:37:50.875
You mean, will the sea glow?

01:37:50.958 --> 01:37:51.791
Apparently.

01:37:54.583 --> 01:37:55.458
No chance.

01:37:57.625 --> 01:37:58.500
What if it does?

01:37:59.958 --> 01:38:00.916
I will miss the photograph.

01:38:03.833 --> 01:38:07.916
You sat here waiting
for an unsure occurrence.

01:38:08.666 --> 01:38:12.666
But, don't you have a photograph of
your wife who shared her life with you?

01:38:13.875 --> 01:38:16.875
Shouldn't Mahi know,
what her mother looks like?

01:38:20.625 --> 01:38:21.833
I don't have any photos.

01:38:23.833 --> 01:38:28.708
What about the one you captured
for the first time, in the rain?

01:38:29.125 --> 01:38:30.833
- Don't you have that?
- Am I not telling you? I don't have them.

01:38:31.125 --> 01:38:34.041
Okay… Sorry…

01:38:34.125 --> 01:38:36.416
It's okay if you don't wish to show.

01:38:38.083 --> 01:38:38.916
Cool!

01:38:42.875 --> 01:38:45.916
At least you can
describe her looks, right?

01:38:54.333 --> 01:38:55.166
What?

01:38:55.375 --> 01:38:56.708
Did you forget her appearance?

01:38:57.333 --> 01:38:58.916
Do you even remember her face?

01:39:12.833 --> 01:39:13.916
Small eyes.

01:39:16.041 --> 01:39:19.291
Her smile would bulge her cheeks
and make her eyes even smaller.

01:39:22.291 --> 01:39:25.208
Her skin is like this sand's color.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:30.166
No matter how irked I was…

01:39:32.625 --> 01:39:34.458
she was a heart-melting sight.

01:39:38.125 --> 01:39:39.416
Sometimes she wore a sari.

01:39:40.708 --> 01:39:41.583
In a black sari…

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.291
it feels like she smeared all the
darkness on her body.

01:39:49.833 --> 01:39:50.791
A black dot on the forehead.

01:39:54.958 --> 01:39:56.958
A nose piercing…

01:40:00.125 --> 01:40:01.041
balancing all the beauty.

01:40:02.833 --> 01:40:04.916
After taking a shower,

01:40:06.833 --> 01:40:07.875
she probably intentionally
leaves her hair wet.

01:40:11.166 --> 01:40:12.291
All the hair falls on one side

01:40:13.875 --> 01:40:15.041
and it looks wavy.

01:40:17.875 --> 01:40:19.166
In one word…

01:40:22.083 --> 01:40:22.958
She looks like this.

01:40:53.333 --> 01:40:56.625
Why do you love her so much,
even after she left you?

01:40:58.958 --> 01:41:01.916
I just described her…
is this called love?

01:41:02.458 --> 01:41:03.375
No…

01:41:04.208 --> 01:41:05.458
This is called love!

01:41:35.375 --> 01:41:36.541
<i>What are you doing, Yashna?</i>

01:41:38.208 --> 01:41:39.833
<i>Are you remembering everything?</i>

01:41:40.625 --> 01:41:42.166
<i>Or am I triggering those memories?</i>

01:41:43.833 --> 01:41:46.291
<i>You wished all this hadn’t happened.</i>
<i>Even if I tell you everything…</i>

01:41:47.291 --> 01:41:50.708
<i>Would you consider this the truth?</i>
<i>Or a dream?</i>

01:41:52.083 --> 01:41:55.666
<i>Or would you assume</i>
<i>that I cooked up a story?</i>

01:41:56.625 --> 01:42:00.500
<i>If I continue to stay close to you,</i>
<i>would you pull me close like a wave?</i>

01:42:37.416 --> 01:42:42.583
<i>Like the swinging wave</i>

01:42:43.041 --> 01:42:48.458
<i>Did you flatter me</i>
<i>With that dangling hair?</i>

01:42:48.708 --> 01:42:53.458
<i>Are those the same naughty eyes?</i>

01:42:54.291 --> 01:42:58.000
<i>See the same thunder again</i>

01:42:58.208 --> 01:43:03.833
<i>Isn’t this a dream?</i>

01:43:04.583 --> 01:43:09.250
<i>To join the heart again</i>

01:43:09.416 --> 01:43:15.250
<i>Has the river walked down?</i>

01:43:15.833 --> 01:43:22.416
<i>My life has become a rock and not moving</i>

01:43:22.500 --> 01:43:29.500
<i>This is like the first time</i>

01:43:33.875 --> 01:43:40.875
<i>It’s shaking my heart</i>

01:43:44.875 --> 01:43:50.458
<i>Like a breath</i>

01:44:16.125 --> 01:44:21.500
<i>Is the skin tone, the sand’s color?</i>

01:44:21.750 --> 01:44:27.291
<i>The sari looks like</i>
<i>A dark sky during the night</i>

01:44:27.458 --> 01:44:32.458
<i>Your nose-piercing is appreciating you</i>

01:44:33.125 --> 01:44:36.750
<i>Your sectarian mark is</i>
<i>Caressing your forehead</i>

01:44:36.958 --> 01:44:42.750
<i>Memories…</i>

01:44:43.375 --> 01:44:47.958
<i>Have walked back</i>

01:44:48.416 --> 01:44:54.333
<i>And shook me</i>

01:44:54.625 --> 01:45:01.291
<i>This silence isn’t letting me speak</i>

01:45:01.375 --> 01:45:07.916
<i>This is like for the first time</i>

01:45:12.666 --> 01:45:19.666
<i>It’s shaking my heart</i>

01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:24.583
Where is she?

01:45:29.708 --> 01:45:32.500
Aravind, you know
how marriages work, right?

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.166
I think she just started to get cold feet.

01:45:37.708 --> 01:45:39.666
She said beaches calm her down.

01:45:40.666 --> 01:45:42.625
But, if I don't allow her…

01:45:43.750 --> 01:45:46.041
she said she would ask her Dad.

01:45:49.708 --> 01:45:50.916
And I don't want that.

01:45:53.541 --> 01:45:55.000
What's so special about the Goan beaches…

01:45:57.791 --> 01:45:58.958
that you can't get on Mumbai's beaches?

01:46:10.625 --> 01:46:12.041
Well, my dear friends and family…

01:46:12.958 --> 01:46:15.166
I have some good news
and some bad news.

01:46:15.833 --> 01:46:18.166
The bad news is that
Yashna won't be joining us.

01:46:20.166 --> 01:46:21.500
But the good news is…

01:46:33.208 --> 01:46:34.916
- Mahi.
- She is sleeping.

01:46:36.083 --> 01:46:37.666
- I will take her.
- Why?

01:46:37.833 --> 01:46:39.041
Let her sleep here.

01:46:40.500 --> 01:46:41.916
- It's okay.
- Viraj.

01:46:43.250 --> 01:46:44.791
Come on!
It's just one day.

01:46:48.166 --> 01:46:50.000
I'm sorry. I insist.
Don't mind.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:56.166
Why do you have to be
so adamant about this?

01:46:56.333 --> 01:46:57.708
What will happen over one night?

01:46:58.000 --> 01:46:58.833
You are there today.

01:46:59.541 --> 01:47:01.375
Tomorrow you won't.
What if she gets habituated to you?

01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:05.875
So, you will take her away this harshly?

01:47:06.041 --> 01:47:07.541
You know, how happy she was today?

01:47:07.625 --> 01:47:09.125
You don't know a girl's needs.

01:47:09.291 --> 01:47:10.708
She needs a feminine touch.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:11.833
She needs female parenting.

01:47:11.916 --> 01:47:16.958
Buying a few accessories
and clothes is not parenting

01:47:18.958 --> 01:47:21.041
I'm not in a position to hear it from you.

01:47:25.541 --> 01:47:26.500
Your vacation is over, right?

01:47:27.458 --> 01:47:28.291
Now, please leave us.

01:47:47.791 --> 01:47:48.666
Was she hurt?

01:47:49.041 --> 01:47:49.875
A lot.

01:47:54.166 --> 01:47:55.041
What do I do?

01:47:55.250 --> 01:47:56.500
Go get my sister.

01:48:16.708 --> 01:48:18.250
You have to do a shot.

01:48:18.500 --> 01:48:19.333
Come on…

01:48:23.541 --> 01:48:26.833
Can't you do one shot?
You're such a baby!

01:48:43.708 --> 01:48:48.291
<i>Bring out the comfort inside you</i>
<i>Throw out the guy inside you</i>

01:48:48.375 --> 01:48:52.041
<i>Don’t hide anything anymore</i>
<i>Your job is to freak out</i>

01:48:53.083 --> 01:48:57.583
<i>Bend and look at the sky below</i>
<i>Paint new colors to the air</i>

01:48:57.666 --> 01:49:01.416
<i>Let tomorrow swallow the yesterday</i>
<i>Why do you need it anyway?</i>

01:49:01.875 --> 01:49:06.500
<i>Pour some excitement in one shot</i>
<i>Pour some joy in one shot</i>

01:49:06.583 --> 01:49:10.666
<i>Pour some resentment in one shot and</i>
<i>Pour everything inside the body</i>

01:49:11.500 --> 01:49:15.791
<i>Oh my God, this heat, EDM-like beat</i>

01:49:16.041 --> 01:49:20.000
<i>Radium like light</i>
<i>Here and there in this party</i>

01:49:29.916 --> 01:49:34.208
<i>Oh my God, this heat, EDM-like beat</i>

01:49:34.500 --> 01:49:38.625
<i>Radium like light</i>
<i>Here and there in this party</i>

01:49:57.291 --> 01:50:01.875
<i>Feel high, feel this high</i>
<i>Join hands with me</i>

01:50:01.958 --> 01:50:05.791
<i>Why do you stare at</i>
<i>Something or someone else</i>

01:50:06.541 --> 01:50:11.125
<i>Time moves, the brain gets sloshed</i>

01:50:11.208 --> 01:50:15.708
<i>Leave and come to me!</i>

01:50:15.791 --> 01:50:20.291
<i>Pour some happiness into one glass</i>
<i>Pour some thought into one glass</i>

01:50:20.375 --> 01:50:24.666
<i>Pour some fury into one glass</i>
<i>Empty every glass</i>

01:50:25.166 --> 01:50:29.625
<i>Oh my God, this heat, EDM-like beat</i>

01:50:29.833 --> 01:50:33.958
<i>Radium like light</i>
<i>Here and there in this party</i>

01:50:48.416 --> 01:50:52.875
<i>Is it vibrant or slipping off</i>
<i>Or what happened to life?</i>

01:50:52.958 --> 01:50:57.458
<i>Did the imagination feel like truth</i>

01:50:57.541 --> 01:51:02.208
<i>Or truth feel like imagination</i>

01:51:02.291 --> 01:51:06.375
<i>Is the deja vu spinning</i>
<i>Or is it spinning me?</i>

01:51:06.458 --> 01:51:11.041
<i>Your past is an underworld</i>
<i>There is Kailash in this ebriety</i>

01:51:11.125 --> 01:51:15.583
<i>There is Vaikunth in this vibe</i>
<i>This stupor is salvation</i>

01:51:15.958 --> 01:51:20.458
<i>Oh my God, this heat, EDM-like beat</i>

01:51:20.625 --> 01:51:24.791
<i>Radium like light</i>
<i>Here and there in this party</i>

01:51:34.500 --> 01:51:38.875
<i>Oh my god, this heat, EDM-like beat</i>

01:51:39.041 --> 01:51:43.291
<i>Radium like light</i>
<i>Here and there in this party</i>

01:51:49.083 --> 01:51:54.000
I heard your love story
and imagined it as a great one.

01:51:54.208 --> 01:51:58.125
And here you're getting drunk
and dancing with heroines.

01:51:58.583 --> 01:51:59.416
Shame on you!

01:52:02.750 --> 01:52:06.625
God, I wish that kid didn't give
me that puppy back.

01:52:07.041 --> 01:52:08.791
My life would have been blissful.

01:52:10.666 --> 01:52:12.916
What kid? What did you just say?

01:52:13.333 --> 01:52:15.000
I dare you to speak loudly.

01:52:16.166 --> 01:52:18.583
Speak loudly? Then listen.

01:52:19.208 --> 01:52:21.083
Your wiring in the brain
got screwed in that accident.

01:52:27.791 --> 01:52:31.375
You don't have the
wiring in the first place.

01:52:32.416 --> 01:52:33.291
Hey!

01:52:34.666 --> 01:52:38.583
Speak about anything but my accident.

01:52:39.750 --> 01:52:42.041
What will you do?

01:52:42.125 --> 01:52:44.250
Beat me.
Come on, beat me.

01:52:44.333 --> 01:52:45.416
One minute… One minute.

01:52:46.500 --> 01:52:47.916
Why are we openly discussing things?

01:52:49.125 --> 01:52:50.541
Oh sorry, you won't
remember this by morning.

01:52:52.583 --> 01:52:54.250
So far, you deleted
everything selectively.

01:52:56.833 --> 01:52:58.458
I won't forget.

01:52:58.708 --> 01:53:00.666
I remember everything.

01:53:01.500 --> 01:53:02.833
- Is it?
- Yes.

01:53:17.083 --> 01:53:17.916
Say it again.

01:53:20.125 --> 01:53:21.833
I don't forget anything.

01:53:22.125 --> 01:53:23.000
Five seconds.

01:53:23.125 --> 01:53:26.500
One, two, three, four, five.

01:53:26.583 --> 01:53:27.750
Repeat what you just said.

01:53:28.041 --> 01:53:28.875
What?

01:53:29.125 --> 01:53:30.875
You don't remember what you just said.

01:53:32.375 --> 01:53:33.333
What did you say the other day?

01:53:35.458 --> 01:53:40.291
You have people who
will remember things for you.

01:53:40.583 --> 01:53:44.000
That's why I have no regrets.

01:53:45.208 --> 01:53:46.666
Why will you have regrets?

01:53:48.250 --> 01:53:50.708
The one next to you with all the memory…

01:53:52.541 --> 01:53:53.458
will have regrets.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.500
Regrets…

01:54:00.208 --> 01:54:03.541
You enjoy your shopping and your wedding.

01:54:03.625 --> 01:54:05.416
But, you turn a blind eye
to what others are going through.

01:54:07.791 --> 01:54:08.958
You're great!

01:54:11.625 --> 01:54:12.583
How dare you?

01:54:17.291 --> 01:54:18.166
How dare you?

01:54:18.541 --> 01:54:20.958
See, what I'll do.

01:54:21.833 --> 01:54:23.375
I shared my problems with you…
And you…

01:55:03.166 --> 01:55:04.041
Hi.

01:55:47.416 --> 01:55:48.458
Yashna.

01:55:54.208 --> 01:55:55.791
Can I ask you something?

01:56:00.666 --> 01:56:03.041
Will you stay with us forever?

01:56:28.083 --> 01:56:30.208
You seem quite confident
that we'll be blessed with a girl.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.083
What did you think about the baby's name?

01:56:34.791 --> 01:56:35.666
<i>What's your name?</i>

01:56:36.583 --> 01:56:37.458
Mahima.

01:56:40.958 --> 01:56:41.833
Mahi.

01:57:06.666 --> 01:57:08.041
Apparently, Dimitrov has a boyfriend.

01:57:08.125 --> 01:57:09.875
But, Selena doesn't have one.
But, it's--

01:57:09.958 --> 01:57:11.583
Justin, where is Viraj?

01:57:12.333 --> 01:57:13.291
<i>I just got a call.</i>

01:57:14.333 --> 01:57:16.375
<i>The lung you applied for</i>
<i>has been sanctioned.</i>

01:57:16.625 --> 01:57:17.458
That's it.

01:57:18.125 --> 01:57:19.083
We are saving her.

01:57:19.541 --> 01:57:21.166
But, it's not about the lungs.

01:57:22.250 --> 01:57:25.083
It's about Mahi's condition and her age.

01:57:25.666 --> 01:57:28.791
<i>The survival rate is just 0.1 percent.</i>

01:57:29.833 --> 01:57:32.125
<i>And no doctor will take this risk.</i>

01:57:33.083 --> 01:57:36.791
If you leave her like this,
she might survive another six years.

01:57:37.916 --> 01:57:40.083
Why are you taking her chances away?

01:57:41.333 --> 01:57:42.375
You said three once.

01:57:43.875 --> 01:57:45.250
Now you are saying six.

01:57:47.041 --> 01:57:48.125
When were you right?
Then or now?

01:57:51.250 --> 01:57:52.083
Okay, then leave.

01:57:53.541 --> 01:57:54.625
If you can't acquire a lung…

01:57:58.166 --> 01:57:59.166
If something happens to my daughter…

01:58:05.083 --> 01:58:06.333
We're getting this operation done.

01:58:07.375 --> 01:58:08.291
No matter what.

01:58:09.833 --> 01:58:11.250
Whatever the percentage may be.

01:58:12.583 --> 01:58:14.000
<i>My daughter and I will battle it.</i>

01:58:21.791 --> 01:58:22.625
Viraj.

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:26.833
Were you aware that
you will have a daughter?

01:58:29.416 --> 01:58:31.833
The girl who gave Pluto to you…
was her name Mahi?

01:58:35.500 --> 01:58:36.333
What are you saying?

01:58:37.208 --> 01:58:38.541
I'm not understanding anything.

01:58:39.250 --> 01:58:43.041
I might've imagined myself as Varsha,
more than your daughter.

01:58:44.291 --> 01:58:47.541
I'm dreaming about things
that I didn't hear in your story.

01:58:51.625 --> 01:58:54.041
I assumed all this was
because of my accident.

01:58:54.791 --> 01:58:56.375
Because of my overthinking.

01:58:56.875 --> 01:58:59.000
Because of my crazy fondness for Mahi.

01:59:11.416 --> 01:59:14.583
I like you, Viraj.

01:59:18.208 --> 01:59:19.500
I'm not assuming it.

01:59:21.541 --> 01:59:22.458
I know it already.

01:59:26.333 --> 01:59:27.208
Do you like me?

01:59:45.875 --> 01:59:46.708
Sister-in-law.

01:59:47.791 --> 01:59:50.250
There you are.
I was searching for you in the resort.

01:59:54.916 --> 01:59:56.750
What? Are you surprised to see me?

01:59:57.416 --> 01:59:58.958
There is a bigger
surprise waiting for you.

01:59:59.083 --> 02:00:00.583
Come. We're leaving.

02:00:07.458 --> 02:00:08.291
Sister-in-law.

02:00:11.208 --> 02:00:12.041
Neha.

02:00:55.458 --> 02:00:57.000
Were you scared of the wedding,
all of a sudden?

02:01:01.833 --> 02:01:03.375
I heard these beaches calm you down.

02:01:05.250 --> 02:01:07.750
So, I brought the whole
wedding here for you.

02:01:10.583 --> 02:01:11.500
You asked me, right?

02:01:13.541 --> 02:01:14.375
Yashna!

02:01:16.625 --> 02:01:17.500
My fiancée.

02:01:22.958 --> 02:01:24.125
Did she have a dream or was that true?

02:01:27.541 --> 02:01:28.541
Fine, don't tell me.

02:01:28.833 --> 02:01:30.666
But she returned
and expressed her feelings for you.

02:01:31.125 --> 02:01:32.250
At least tell her.

02:01:32.833 --> 02:01:33.666
Tell her and what…?

02:01:33.750 --> 02:01:34.916
You can get your life back.

02:01:35.625 --> 02:01:37.250
Or start a new one altogether.

02:01:38.500 --> 02:01:39.416
Start and…?

02:01:40.083 --> 02:01:44.583
Don't be stubborn.
You, Yashna, and Mahi can live happily.

02:01:50.875 --> 02:01:52.791
Me, Yashna, and Mahi.

02:02:01.875 --> 02:02:02.750
Happy?

02:02:18.916 --> 02:02:20.333
Yashna!

02:02:31.541 --> 02:02:32.791
Yashna!

02:02:48.833 --> 02:02:50.416
Yashna!

02:03:12.708 --> 02:03:15.125
Dad, Yashna!

02:03:52.208 --> 02:03:56.916
<i>All your dreams have</i>
<i>Melted in front of you</i>

02:03:57.416 --> 02:04:02.041
<i>Still you're hopeful</i>

02:04:02.500 --> 02:04:07.208
<i>What happened?</i>
<i>This love was born suddenly</i>

02:04:07.583 --> 02:04:11.708
<i>For which I have no answers</i>

02:04:11.791 --> 02:04:16.750
<i>Did you imagine things?</i>
<i>Did you love with your life?</i>

02:04:17.250 --> 02:04:20.708
<i>It pulled my heart</i>

02:04:20.791 --> 02:04:26.458
<i>It pulled my heart</i>

02:04:27.458 --> 02:04:32.333
<i>One bitter truth</i>
<i>And a haunting past</i>

02:04:32.416 --> 02:04:38.666
<i>Has distanced our dreams</i>

02:04:38.750 --> 02:04:42.500
<i>Once upon a time,</i>
<i>there was a young fairy.</i>

02:04:43.250 --> 02:04:45.791
<i>She lived in a dense forest.</i>

02:04:48.750 --> 02:04:50.166
I really need you, Dad.

02:04:55.666 --> 02:04:58.208
I loved someone.

02:05:03.916 --> 02:05:04.833
His name is Viraj.

02:05:06.166 --> 02:05:07.708
I have to meet Yashna.

02:05:13.375 --> 02:05:15.250
I have to ask her something.

02:05:17.541 --> 02:05:20.875
Mahi, you know tomorrow is her wedding.

02:05:21.541 --> 02:05:22.416
We shouldn't disturb her.

02:05:23.333 --> 02:05:24.625
Please, Dad.

02:05:25.416 --> 02:05:26.291
No, Mahi.

02:05:28.708 --> 02:05:31.000
Mahi, we're leaving for Mumbai.
We have an important appointment.

02:05:31.083 --> 02:05:31.916
Go to sleep now.

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:36.708
<i>One bitter truth</i>
<i>And a haunting past</i>

02:05:36.791 --> 02:05:41.375
<i>Has distanced our dreams</i>

02:05:41.458 --> 02:05:43.875
<i>One bitter truth</i>
<i>And a haunting past</i>

02:05:44.375 --> 02:05:45.250
Pluto.

02:05:46.791 --> 02:05:47.625
Mahi.

02:05:56.375 --> 02:05:57.291
I didn't find her.

02:06:02.083 --> 02:06:03.000
Where is Yashna's wedding?

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:12.291
You guys have to get it done.

02:06:15.458 --> 02:06:16.291
You check on that side.

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:21.875
Mahi!

02:06:23.750 --> 02:06:24.625
Hey.

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:26.041
Are you looking for someone?

02:06:26.791 --> 02:06:28.791
Yashna…
My daughter…

02:06:28.875 --> 02:06:30.041
- Yashna?
- Yes.

02:06:30.125 --> 02:06:30.958
This way.

02:06:40.416 --> 02:06:41.375
Yashna.

02:06:41.833 --> 02:06:43.583
Hi, come here…

02:06:43.708 --> 02:06:44.625
Hey…

02:07:04.291 --> 02:07:05.166
Mahi.

02:07:06.500 --> 02:07:08.208
Where are you going?
Dad is searching for you.

02:07:08.791 --> 02:07:10.666
Uncle, I have to talk to Yashna.

02:07:10.916 --> 02:07:11.791
Come now.

02:07:12.375 --> 02:07:13.291
Two minutes…

02:07:13.958 --> 02:07:16.791
- Please.
- No, Mahi. Dad is…

02:07:33.875 --> 02:07:35.958
I think there is a misunderstanding.

02:07:45.958 --> 02:07:48.250
He promised that he would never
turn up again in our lives.

02:07:48.750 --> 02:07:49.583
Is that why…

02:07:50.916 --> 02:07:53.625
he sent you and his daughter?

02:07:53.875 --> 02:07:56.458
You're worrying unnecessarily, ma'am.

02:07:56.666 --> 02:07:59.125
We're just here to take the child away.
That's it.

02:07:59.291 --> 02:08:02.833
My daughter survived the accident,

02:08:04.291 --> 02:08:05.375
not his wife.

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:07.208
No…

02:08:07.500 --> 02:08:09.458
Ma'am, please speak softly.

02:08:10.625 --> 02:08:11.750
The child doesn't know anything.

02:08:11.833 --> 02:08:14.625
Did she come this far
without knowing anything?

02:08:16.041 --> 02:08:19.458
Did they meet her without any plan?

02:08:34.791 --> 02:08:40.333
Can Yashna bear the news
that her child won't live long enough?

02:08:44.083 --> 02:08:46.541
- I'm not sure what your dad has told you.
- Ma'am.

02:08:46.833 --> 02:08:48.458
- But let me tell you.
- Please, ma'am.

02:08:48.875 --> 02:08:49.791
Please, ma'am.

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.375
Yashna forgot that you are her daughter.

02:08:55.583 --> 02:08:57.458
You can forget
that she is your mother as well.

02:09:02.625 --> 02:09:03.500
Ashok.

02:09:09.041 --> 02:09:09.875
Leave this place.

02:09:09.958 --> 02:09:11.125
Do you know what he did?

02:09:11.208 --> 02:09:12.166
Leave.

02:09:27.833 --> 02:09:28.666
Viraj, right?

02:09:31.375 --> 02:09:32.250
I know you.

02:09:34.458 --> 02:09:36.333
I'm sorry for what my brother did.
He is a bit…

02:09:38.708 --> 02:09:39.708
I'm Dr. Aravind.

02:09:40.666 --> 02:09:42.291
I'm the one marrying your ex-wife.

02:09:44.541 --> 02:09:47.416
I don't have a problem
if your arrival is a coincidence.

02:09:47.916 --> 02:09:49.291
But, if it's a plan,

02:09:50.583 --> 02:09:51.833
we both have a problem.

02:09:52.583 --> 02:09:55.208
She has suffered enough because of you.

02:09:58.416 --> 02:09:59.416
I suggest you leave.

02:10:07.291 --> 02:10:08.208
Pluto.

02:10:09.083 --> 02:10:10.875
Mahi!
Where is Mahi?

02:10:10.958 --> 02:10:11.875
Mahi!

02:10:14.083 --> 02:10:14.958
Pluto.

02:10:23.416 --> 02:10:24.291
Dad.

02:10:33.041 --> 02:10:33.958
Where did you go, Mahi?

02:10:37.083 --> 02:10:38.083
Do you know what happened to me?

02:10:42.458 --> 02:10:43.791
You left once because
I didn't tell you your mother's story.

02:10:45.958 --> 02:10:47.583
Now you are leaving in search of Yashna.

02:10:52.791 --> 02:10:54.250
Do you remember that I'm here?

02:10:59.625 --> 02:11:01.416
Did you never feel like
waiting for your dad?

02:11:08.708 --> 02:11:10.208
Where did I go so wrong?

02:11:14.666 --> 02:11:16.000
Where?

02:11:23.583 --> 02:11:25.458
Isn't my love enough, Mahi?

02:11:39.083 --> 02:11:41.708
I won't leave you again, Dad.

02:11:44.625 --> 02:11:48.166
Take me wherever you go this time.

02:11:51.458 --> 02:11:53.041
You wanted to ask Yashna something, right?

02:11:54.166 --> 02:11:55.208
Did you?

02:11:57.958 --> 02:11:58.833
Why?

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:01.416
65 Roses.

02:12:02.500 --> 02:12:04.541
Mom will cry, Dad.

02:12:05.750 --> 02:12:06.791
Sorry.

02:12:07.750 --> 02:12:08.625
I tried really hard.

02:12:10.083 --> 02:12:11.250
Aunty spilled the beans.

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:30.875
Pluto!

02:12:42.708 --> 02:12:44.000
You came for me, right?

02:12:44.708 --> 02:12:46.375
You really like me a lot, right?

02:12:48.541 --> 02:12:50.041
Just tell me you like me.

02:12:52.166 --> 02:12:53.791
I will leave everything behind
and come with you.

02:12:55.958 --> 02:12:56.958
Aren't you ashamed?

02:13:00.375 --> 02:13:01.333
You've decided to come
with a stranger like me,

02:13:02.458 --> 02:13:04.375
while you're about to get married.

02:13:05.708 --> 02:13:07.250
What kind of a character is this?

02:13:12.166 --> 02:13:14.125
I'm not sure,
why you imagined yourself as Varsha.

02:13:15.958 --> 02:13:18.625
But, you are similar in one aspect.

02:13:20.333 --> 02:13:23.625
You both tend to run away from problems.

02:13:26.708 --> 02:13:27.583
Just give up.

02:13:30.666 --> 02:13:33.375
You are insulting me for being honest.

02:13:36.750 --> 02:13:39.291
Mahi, did you hear what your father said?

02:13:40.750 --> 02:13:41.583
Mahi…

02:13:44.333 --> 02:13:45.166
Mahi…

02:13:45.833 --> 02:13:46.791
you tell me.

02:13:47.333 --> 02:13:48.875
Didn't you imagine me as your mother?

02:13:50.166 --> 02:13:51.541
I did.

02:13:52.041 --> 02:13:54.041
But, you are not my real mother.

02:14:36.583 --> 02:14:37.500
Take Mahi out.

02:14:46.625 --> 02:14:47.458
Take her out.

02:15:40.458 --> 02:15:41.458
Deal with me.

02:15:43.750 --> 02:15:44.625
I'll bear it.

02:15:47.791 --> 02:15:48.875
But dealing with Mahi…

02:15:54.875 --> 02:15:55.958
You've revealed the secret…

02:15:57.416 --> 02:15:58.625
that I hid from my daughter.

02:16:00.458 --> 02:16:03.750
Should I reveal it to your daughter?

02:16:07.958 --> 02:16:10.333
<i>One bitter truth</i>

02:16:10.583 --> 02:16:12.875
<i>And a haunting past</i>

02:16:13.041 --> 02:16:18.875
<i>Has distanced our dreams</i>

02:16:18.958 --> 02:16:20.625
<i>One bitter truth</i>

02:16:20.791 --> 02:16:23.166
<i>And a wounded past</i>

02:16:23.375 --> 02:16:29.458
<i>Has distanced our love</i>

02:16:40.375 --> 02:16:41.541
- Mahi!
- What happened?

02:16:41.833 --> 02:16:43.041
Mahi…

02:16:43.625 --> 02:16:44.500
- Mahi!
- Mahi!

02:16:44.791 --> 02:16:45.750
Mahi!

02:16:45.833 --> 02:16:46.666
Mahi!

02:16:50.041 --> 02:16:50.875
Doctor!

02:16:59.666 --> 02:17:00.583
Mahi, get up.

02:17:10.583 --> 02:17:11.583
Mahi, get up.

02:17:12.333 --> 02:17:17.041
<i>You’re no one to us</i>
<i>We don’t want you</i>

02:17:17.625 --> 02:17:22.166
<i>Why can’t you listen to them?</i>
<i>Why do you cry, my heart?</i>

02:17:22.583 --> 02:17:27.291
<i>In your imaginary palace</i>
<i>We don’t have a place for you</i>

02:17:27.708 --> 02:17:31.916
<i>Look, It has collapsed today</i>
<i>Like this</i>

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:36.833
<i>Was I delusional?</i>
<i>Or was I absent despite staying with you?</i>

02:17:37.500 --> 02:17:43.083
<i>You keep saying I’m no one to you</i>

02:17:43.166 --> 02:17:46.750
<i>While I’m losing my mind here</i>

02:17:46.833 --> 02:17:47.666
Yashna.

02:17:52.708 --> 02:17:53.916
So, you're getting married?

02:17:55.166 --> 02:17:56.125
So, you're getting married?

02:17:57.625 --> 02:17:58.833
You finally got the time?

02:17:59.958 --> 02:18:01.875
I had important work.

02:18:03.833 --> 02:18:07.291
What is more important
than your daughter's wedding, Dad?

02:18:40.833 --> 02:18:42.458
You like Viraj, right?

02:18:42.791 --> 02:18:44.416
Why are you marrying Aravind?

02:18:45.083 --> 02:18:47.250
He doesn't like me.

02:18:48.666 --> 02:18:51.125
I thought at least
his daughter would like me.

02:18:51.708 --> 02:18:54.333
But, she was worse than him.

02:18:55.708 --> 02:18:59.166
He insulted me for proposing my love.

02:19:01.333 --> 02:19:02.708
He compared me with his wife.

02:19:03.666 --> 02:19:05.875
Said that we are similar.

02:19:08.333 --> 02:19:11.625
He was right, wasn't he?

02:19:13.541 --> 02:19:14.375
Right?

02:19:20.791 --> 02:19:22.708
Don't I ever fight?

02:19:23.666 --> 02:19:25.125
When did I ever give up, Dad?

02:19:26.833 --> 02:19:27.791
Now.

02:19:28.458 --> 02:19:29.541
Not when he said so.

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:33.500
When you gave up fighting
for your love, after what he said.

02:19:34.291 --> 02:19:35.916
That's when you behaved like his wife.

02:19:39.750 --> 02:19:41.916
What else could I do, Dad?

02:19:42.416 --> 02:19:48.500
Prove that you're not like his wife
and you won't run away from problems.

02:19:51.250 --> 02:19:56.333
His daughter is admitted to the ICU.
She is battling death.

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.958
She may not make it.

02:20:01.416 --> 02:20:02.333
Yashna…

02:20:02.666 --> 02:20:04.416
Will you stand with him and fight

02:20:04.625 --> 02:20:07.041
or will you give up like his wife?

02:20:08.750 --> 02:20:11.708
It's your call.

02:20:14.250 --> 02:20:15.166
Yashna…

02:20:16.250 --> 02:20:17.708
we are running late.

02:20:19.541 --> 02:20:22.041
- You can speak to your dad later.
- Go.

02:20:22.791 --> 02:20:24.333
Everyone is waiting… Go.

02:20:24.791 --> 02:20:25.666
Dad…

02:20:26.708 --> 02:20:27.541
What?

02:20:29.375 --> 02:20:32.083
It's your life.
You loved him.

02:20:32.375 --> 02:20:34.125
You must battle.

02:20:42.083 --> 02:20:43.208
Everyone is waiting.

02:20:44.958 --> 02:20:45.791
Come, let's go.

02:20:49.875 --> 02:20:52.291
<i>One bitter truth</i>

02:20:52.375 --> 02:20:54.625
<i>And a haunting past</i>

02:20:54.708 --> 02:20:59.958
<i>Has distanced our dreams</i>

02:21:00.041 --> 02:21:01.791
<i>One bitter truth</i>

02:21:01.958 --> 02:21:04.250
<i>And a wounded past</i>

02:21:04.333 --> 02:21:09.791
<i>- Has distanced our love</i>
- Come on.

02:21:24.041 --> 02:21:24.958
What happened?

02:21:26.083 --> 02:21:27.166
Aravind, I have to go.

02:21:29.708 --> 02:21:31.791
What are you even talking about?

02:21:32.333 --> 02:21:33.166
Is it Viraj?

02:21:33.833 --> 02:21:34.958
Do you know Viraj?

02:21:35.625 --> 02:21:36.833
Do you even know Viraj?

02:21:38.208 --> 02:21:39.041
Fine.

02:21:39.375 --> 02:21:40.708
You can leave
if you don't like this marriage.

02:21:42.083 --> 02:21:44.125
But, he isn't the right guy for you.

02:21:44.833 --> 02:21:45.875
How can you say that?

02:21:46.875 --> 02:21:49.875
You don't know how much
his wife suffered because of him.

02:21:50.375 --> 02:21:52.291
He suffered a lot as well.

02:21:53.916 --> 02:21:55.250
She wanted a divorce.

02:21:59.208 --> 02:22:00.958
- No, she didn't.
- She did.

02:22:01.416 --> 02:22:02.291
She must not have.

02:22:02.375 --> 02:22:03.958
I'm telling you, she asked for a divorce.

02:22:04.166 --> 02:22:05.125
I didn't ask for it.

02:22:17.458 --> 02:22:18.333
I'm sorry.

02:22:21.166 --> 02:22:23.166
She must not have asked for it.

02:22:24.333 --> 02:22:27.791
This just doesn't add up.

02:22:29.708 --> 02:22:30.625
How could she?

02:22:31.958 --> 02:22:32.833
She didn't.

02:22:34.416 --> 02:22:35.583
She didn't.

02:22:37.500 --> 02:22:38.875
She didn't.

02:22:46.208 --> 02:22:47.083
She didn't.

02:22:52.208 --> 02:22:53.041
Go.

02:22:54.583 --> 02:22:55.416
Aravind.

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:02.583
Leave before I change my mind.

02:23:20.333 --> 02:23:22.000
Are you mad?

02:23:22.666 --> 02:23:23.708
Why did you let her go?

02:23:26.500 --> 02:23:27.375
Tell me something.

02:23:27.750 --> 02:23:30.125
Did Yashna really ask for a divorce
before the accident?

02:23:31.750 --> 02:23:32.583
Did she?

02:23:34.583 --> 02:23:35.416
I thought so.

02:23:38.500 --> 02:23:39.875
She must leave him first…

02:23:41.708 --> 02:23:43.083
to ever love me.

02:23:44.375 --> 02:23:46.166
Unnecessarily, they beat him…

02:23:48.541 --> 02:23:49.375
Ashok…?

02:23:58.250 --> 02:24:00.291
Is he more important than your family?

02:24:02.166 --> 02:24:05.208
You ruined your daughter's wedding.

02:24:06.291 --> 02:24:07.916
My daughter got married long ago.

02:24:09.333 --> 02:24:10.708
You did not attend then…

02:24:11.291 --> 02:24:12.750
And I saved it now.

02:24:13.541 --> 02:24:14.375
That's it.

02:24:14.458 --> 02:24:17.958
That's not even a marriage
and it was not even a life she led.

02:24:19.208 --> 02:24:21.208
Is tying the knot with someone…

02:24:22.208 --> 02:24:24.083
and living according to your choices
called marriage and life?

02:24:25.625 --> 02:24:29.750
It will take a lifetime
for you to get her someone like Viraj.

02:24:31.416 --> 02:24:34.041
Yes, he is more important than you.

02:24:34.875 --> 02:24:36.750
That accident proved a point.

02:24:38.041 --> 02:24:41.500
<i>I felt that he</i>
<i>and my granddaughter required me…</i>

02:24:43.541 --> 02:24:48.083
<i>more than my daughter</i>
<i>who had forgotten everything.</i>

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:52.916
That's why I went to them.

02:24:53.625 --> 02:24:54.500
I stayed with him.

02:24:56.541 --> 02:24:59.291
There is no seminar about
Mahi's condition that he didn't attend.

02:25:03.416 --> 02:25:04.750
<i>No doctor he didn't meet.</i>

02:25:07.750 --> 02:25:10.958
<i>He fought with everyone</i>
<i>who suspected her survival chances.</i>

02:25:11.416 --> 02:25:12.333
He is continuing to do so.

02:25:15.166 --> 02:25:17.750
<i>He has been the son I never asked for.</i>

02:25:20.833 --> 02:25:25.291
It won't take a second for him to demolish
the glass castle you built for Yashna.

02:25:26.541 --> 02:25:28.000
But, he won't do that.

02:25:29.083 --> 02:25:31.791
Somewhere, he loves your daughter…

02:25:32.583 --> 02:25:38.125
a bit more than he loves his own.

02:25:40.375 --> 02:25:42.958
<i>Every time, she had to bear the burden…</i>

02:25:43.416 --> 02:25:46.708
<i>He moved away all her memories.</i>

02:25:49.333 --> 02:25:51.375
<i>Yashna lost her memory</i>
<i>six years ago, right?</i>

02:25:52.166 --> 02:25:54.208
<i>She witnessed a great deal of life.</i>

02:25:55.250 --> 02:25:59.208
<i>You, me, her friends</i>
<i>and family were all there for her.</i>

02:25:59.291 --> 02:26:01.666
<i>Despite that if she ends up</i>
<i>falling in love with him again…</i>

02:26:02.625 --> 02:26:03.958
<i>What can we do?</i>

02:26:06.666 --> 02:26:07.875
Some marriages are like that.

02:26:08.791 --> 02:26:11.000
No matter how hard to keep it intact…

02:26:11.166 --> 02:26:13.416
They fail like this one.

02:26:14.250 --> 02:26:15.083
Like ours.

02:26:18.125 --> 02:26:23.000
<i>Some just find their way and reunite</i>
<i>no matter what the differences are.</i>

02:26:26.416 --> 02:26:27.250
<i>Like them.</i>

02:26:28.666 --> 02:26:29.708
We failed as a couple.

02:26:31.541 --> 02:26:34.583
Let's not fail as parents.

02:26:35.541 --> 02:26:36.375
Please.

02:26:44.291 --> 02:26:45.458
She said…

02:26:47.041 --> 02:26:48.041
she would never leave me again.

02:26:52.541 --> 02:26:54.291
She isn't answering me now.

02:26:58.791 --> 02:27:00.000
Everyone thought…

02:27:01.333 --> 02:27:03.250
Mahi survived because of me.

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:05.833
No…

02:27:07.625 --> 02:27:09.000
But the fact is,
I survived because of her.

02:27:13.583 --> 02:27:14.625
I'm scared…

02:27:34.666 --> 02:27:35.583
Look at me.

02:27:37.208 --> 02:27:44.166
I left my marriage and came for you
after seven days of acquaintance.

02:27:46.250 --> 02:27:47.458
She is your daughter.

02:27:48.375 --> 02:27:50.666
How will she leave you?

02:27:52.416 --> 02:27:54.750
If you cry, she will lose.

02:27:55.750 --> 02:27:56.625
You fight for her.

02:27:57.458 --> 02:27:58.500
She will win.

02:28:00.458 --> 02:28:01.583
Nothing will happen to Mahi.

02:28:05.791 --> 02:28:06.750
Promise?

02:28:13.958 --> 02:28:14.958
Promise.

02:28:39.583 --> 02:28:41.625
<i>I was mad at him</i>
<i>and felt like killing him.</i>

02:28:42.083 --> 02:28:42.916
<i>What did you do?</i>

02:28:43.958 --> 02:28:46.583
His daughter was in the ICU.
I didn't feel like hurting him.

02:28:48.916 --> 02:28:50.500
It's a case of Cystic Fibrosis.

02:28:52.583 --> 02:28:54.583
The survival rate is 0.1 percent.

02:28:54.750 --> 02:28:55.875
<i>Respiratory failure.</i>

02:28:56.291 --> 02:28:57.291
<i>Vitals are dropping.</i>

02:28:58.708 --> 02:28:59.625
We have a lung, right?

02:29:00.375 --> 02:29:01.416
What is stopping us?

02:29:01.708 --> 02:29:03.125
But, if we operate…

02:29:05.458 --> 02:29:06.541
the child won't survive.

02:29:06.625 --> 02:29:07.666
<i>Will she survive if we don't?</i>

02:29:07.833 --> 02:29:09.041
<i>Maybe a few hours.</i>

02:29:09.583 --> 02:29:10.666
<i>Anyhow, she is dying.</i>

02:29:11.416 --> 02:29:12.416
<i>What is stopping you, sir?</i>

02:29:14.708 --> 02:29:18.791
This hospital is not equipped with
qualified doctors to perform surgery.

02:29:19.958 --> 02:29:21.375
It has to be done under critical care,
and the the guidance of

02:29:21.625 --> 02:29:25.833
transplant pulmonologists,
and so many others.

02:29:26.791 --> 02:29:28.125
Sir, that's Arjun Srivastav.

02:29:28.375 --> 02:29:31.208
He is a senior consultant.
Pulmonologist, AIIMS, New Delhi.

02:29:31.791 --> 02:29:33.583
<i>That is Mr. Sudeep Bhattacharya.</i>

02:29:33.666 --> 02:29:36.833
<i>He is a senior consultant.</i>
<i>Critical care, Leelavathi Hospital.</i>

02:29:37.125 --> 02:29:38.916
That's Joseph and Hari.

02:29:39.041 --> 02:29:41.250
<i>Two of the best anesthesiologists.</i>

02:29:41.541 --> 02:29:44.000
That's my brother, Ashok.
He is a general surgeon.

02:29:44.458 --> 02:29:46.833
And I'm Aravind Bhatia, sir.
Neurosurgeon.

02:29:50.333 --> 02:29:51.375
It was my wedding.

02:29:52.833 --> 02:29:54.750
Not just me,
all my friends are doctors.

02:29:56.416 --> 02:29:58.416
<i>The country's best doctors are all here.</i>

02:29:59.250 --> 02:30:02.125
<i>If not us, who will save her?</i>

02:30:05.208 --> 02:30:06.458
What if something happens to that child?

02:30:07.166 --> 02:30:08.791
Our reputation will be at stake.

02:30:08.875 --> 02:30:10.208
Then let's make sure she lives.

02:30:13.833 --> 02:30:14.750
Aravind.

02:30:16.291 --> 02:30:18.166
You saved me once.

02:30:20.833 --> 02:30:23.791
Please, save my daughter now.

02:30:25.958 --> 02:30:26.791
Please…

02:30:30.083 --> 02:30:31.041
I'll try my best.

02:30:56.958 --> 02:30:57.791
Mahi.

02:31:02.291 --> 02:31:03.125
Mahi.

02:31:12.625 --> 02:31:13.875
Don't you want me?

02:31:18.958 --> 02:31:19.875
Do you want me?

02:31:27.208 --> 02:31:30.083
Can I stay with you people forever?

02:31:31.416 --> 02:31:35.708
<i>Just determine inside</i>
<i>See…</i>

02:31:37.083 --> 02:31:39.458
<i>It will be done just like that</i>

02:31:42.416 --> 02:31:44.000
Alright, tell me.

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.916
What do you want to become,
when you grow up?

02:31:50.166 --> 02:31:51.541
A singer like my mother.

02:31:51.625 --> 02:31:58.625
<i>Stretch your hands for raindrops</i>

02:31:58.916 --> 02:32:00.333
Come back smiling.

02:32:02.125 --> 02:32:04.750
I will teach you the best song ever.

02:32:06.583 --> 02:32:11.041
<i>Both the sky and earth are yours</i>

02:32:12.250 --> 02:32:13.625
I can sing as well.

02:32:13.791 --> 02:32:15.708
<i>Nothing is impossible to reach</i>

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:20.791
<i>The life inside is yours</i>

02:32:20.958 --> 02:32:23.375
<i>As long as you have that courage in you</i>

02:32:23.458 --> 02:32:25.583
<i>Your smile always accompanies you</i>

02:32:30.833 --> 02:32:33.375
I wish I met you in Coonoor.

02:32:35.625 --> 02:32:37.916
I wish I fell in love with you.

02:32:40.583 --> 02:32:42.916
I wish I married you.

02:32:48.083 --> 02:32:48.958
Mahi…

02:32:50.708 --> 02:32:52.500
I wish Mahi had been born to me.

02:32:53.083 --> 02:32:58.916
<i>Turn time into your path</i>

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:04.500
<i>Write down</i>

02:33:04.958 --> 02:33:10.791
<i>That your journey is your destination</i>

02:33:10.958 --> 02:33:15.583
<i>Like the continents are your companions</i>

02:33:15.875 --> 02:33:20.416
<i>Attract all those worlds</i>

02:33:20.625 --> 02:33:26.583
<i>Like the stars are pals with your song</i>

02:33:26.666 --> 02:33:29.625
<i>They should swing</i>

02:33:31.458 --> 02:33:36.083
<i>Both the sky and earth are yours</i>
<i>If you can believe in yourself</i>

02:33:36.166 --> 02:33:40.791
<i>Nothing is impossible to reach</i>

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:45.625
<i>The life inside is yours</i>

02:33:45.833 --> 02:33:48.250
<i>As long as you have that courage in you</i>

02:33:48.333 --> 02:33:50.708
<i>Your smile always accompanies you</i>

02:33:50.791 --> 02:33:53.291
<i>Breath turned into a string</i>

02:33:54.250 --> 02:33:58.791
<i>Swinging in the heart</i>

02:33:59.708 --> 02:34:03.208
<i>Listen to the sonorous tune</i>

02:34:05.083 --> 02:34:09.958
<i>Listen to it</i>
