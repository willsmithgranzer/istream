'My bright soul...My beloved father
Dedicate this film to you - Your Pradeep'

03:29.125 --> 03:31.333
Dr Pinto! So how's it going?

03:32.208 --> 03:34.750
Hello Mr Murphy. Come, sit.

03:36.750 --> 03:39.416
I have a bad news.
I don't think this radio will work.

03:39.458 --> 03:41.416
- What?
- All components are wet.

03:42.041 --> 03:44.625
I've spent the last three days
trying to figure it out.

03:44.708 --> 03:49.041
If I had a time machine, I'd have
prevented this radio from getting wet.

03:49.125 --> 03:51.833
So you're thinking about
time travel now, huh!

03:51.875 --> 03:53.416
What choice do I have!

03:53.458 --> 03:56.083
You're adamant about
wanting only this radio.

03:56.333 --> 03:58.250
And I don't want to disappoint you.

03:58.416 --> 04:00.166
I know you want to
give this to your father.

04:00.208 --> 04:03.166
But there are so many radios here.
Why don't you choose any of these?

04:03.250 --> 04:05.958
No...No, Doctor Pinto,
this radio is very special to him

04:06.000 --> 04:08.083
Actually, dad had bought
this with his first salary.

04:08.125 --> 04:09.166
Can you imagine?

04:09.208 --> 04:11.375
Doctor, I know you're the only
person who can fix this!

04:11.416 --> 04:12.500
Please!!

04:13.083 --> 04:15.125
So I must invent a time machine now!

04:15.208 --> 04:17.125
Sir, I didn't mean that, sir.
Come on!

04:18.708 --> 04:20.500
'Anyways, sir...'

04:20.875 --> 04:23.250
'Despite knowing it's fictitious,
I'm asking you this.'

04:23.291 --> 04:25.166
'Time machine and time travel'

04:25.208 --> 04:26.791
'What do you think about it?'

04:27.125 --> 04:30.583
Come on, Mr Murphy. Is there
anything you don't know?

04:30.875 --> 04:31.875
Einstein.

04:32.083 --> 04:35.125
Einstein himself says
that time is an illusion.

04:35.625 --> 04:39.708
I mean the past, present
and future, this won't change.

04:39.958 --> 04:43.416
They exactly play out
as they are designed to be.

04:43.833 --> 04:45.083
Like Krishna says,

04:45.125 --> 04:46.333
in the Bhagavad Gita,

04:46.500 --> 04:48.291
Kalaya Tasmai Namaha.

04:48.500 --> 04:50.541
We have to dance to the whims of time.

04:50.708 --> 04:52.083
For example, this radio.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.000
I think it's done and dusted.

04:54.041 --> 04:55.083
I tried my best.

04:55.125 --> 04:57.000
I don't think this
will work any more.

04:57.041 --> 04:58.875
Its old components are tough to get

04:59.000 --> 05:00.375
I have lost all hopes.

05:00.458 --> 05:02.666
Perhaps, you also can try fixing it?

05:09.958 --> 05:11.000
Sir

05:12.666 --> 05:14.500
Sir, it's working...

05:16.958 --> 05:19.541
Didn't you say the components are wet?

05:19.625 --> 05:21.291
How is this possible, sir?

05:22.375 --> 05:24.833
This is impossible!

05:25.791 --> 05:29.875
Sir, are the mic and transmitters
in the radio emitting this noise?

05:29.958 --> 05:33.083
'Ah, yes. Transmitters
in this are connected.'

05:33.125 --> 05:36.875
And sometimes, because of cross
connection, it makes weird noises.

05:36.916 --> 05:38.375
'Yes sir, you're right.'

05:38.666 --> 05:41.375
Sir, now that it's working,
Can I take it back?

05:42.208 --> 05:43.500
You can take this.

05:45.291 --> 05:46.750
And I'm curious to know

05:46.833 --> 05:50.333
Where and when
did your dad buy this radio?

05:50.375 --> 05:52.125
That's a long story, sir!

05:52.166 --> 05:54.125
I'll introduce him
when you come home.

05:54.166 --> 05:56.208
You can discuss this over a peg!

05:57.583 --> 06:00.125
All right.
Take it for now.

06:00.166 --> 06:01.208
- Yes, sir.
- As I said

06:01.291 --> 06:03.125
I'd like to re-examine later.

06:03.208 --> 06:05.583
Sure, sir. Bye.
Thank you so much!

06:05.875 --> 06:07.125
Welcome, bye

06:49.708 --> 06:50.750
Danny, call!

07:01.875 --> 07:03.041
I'll be back.

07:04.166 --> 07:05.291
'Papa!'

07:05.333 --> 07:07.250
Where are you?

07:07.375 --> 07:09.125
Papa, I'm still out.

07:09.250 --> 07:10.583
I'll be late.

07:10.791 --> 07:12.333
It's raining heavily.

07:12.375 --> 07:14.208
Please convince him, dad.

07:14.291 --> 07:16.875
You always have some
excuse up your sleeve!

07:17.791 --> 07:20.375
- The kids have been waiting to cut the cake.
- I know, papa.

07:20.416 --> 07:22.833
He's been asking
'When will papa come'

07:22.875 --> 07:25.250
Sorry, papa. I'll be back soon.

07:25.291 --> 07:27.666
- Okay, be safe.
- Bye.

How do you pretend like
nothing's happened, Richie?

11:32.208 --> 11:34.333
For the past 20 years
I've seen it malfunction

11:34.416 --> 11:36.458
Did you ever let me touch it, even once?

11:39.208 --> 11:40.916
Now if I want to repair it,

11:41.583 --> 11:42.958
what's your problem?

11:44.000 --> 11:45.708
I'm an electrical student.

11:46.500 --> 11:47.791
But what's the use, Richie?

11:49.833 --> 11:53.166
Richie, I'm talking to you.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.125
Please respond!

11:57.375 --> 11:58.583
I can hear you.

11:59.708 --> 12:01.041
You're right.

12:01.916 --> 12:03.291
But...

12:04.166 --> 12:05.625
I'll tell you something.

12:06.791 --> 12:09.708
What he needs is
not your electrical degree.

12:10.500 --> 12:11.666
It's love.

12:12.083 --> 12:14.291
And I am here to give him that love

12:15.541 --> 12:17.333
So don't worry about it.

12:17.791 --> 12:19.500
It's better if you
mind your own business.

12:20.750 --> 12:21.750
Correct, Richie.

12:22.500 --> 12:23.875
Why should I worry about it?

12:24.875 --> 12:26.166
To you, he's a son.

12:27.291 --> 12:28.958
But is not a father to me, isn't it?

12:36.333 --> 12:37.916
And you know what, Richie...

12:39.375 --> 12:40.666
I miss him too...

12:41.750 --> 12:43.166
I miss him too...

13:18.666 --> 13:19.833
David!

13:19.875 --> 13:22.833
How many times have I told
you not to enter this room!

13:22.916 --> 13:24.125
Why did you come here?

13:26.833 --> 13:28.500
Why are you
still standing here?

13:28.541 --> 13:29.666
Get lost!

13:33.083 --> 13:34.333
Go out!

14:31.875 --> 14:32.958
David

14:35.208 --> 14:36.250
'David!'

15:11.541 --> 15:12.583
David!

15:13.500 --> 15:16.875
You hug me despite slapping you.
How shameless of you!

15:18.375 --> 15:20.041
Go say that to someone
who has some shame.

15:20.083 --> 15:21.708
If you get to know
what I've got

15:21.791 --> 15:23.541
you will forget
that you slapped me.

15:25.250 --> 15:26.458
What's that?

15:28.666 --> 15:30.000
Radio manual.

15:30.250 --> 15:33.375
The amount of challenges
I faced to find this for you!

15:34.125 --> 15:36.541
Even if a child reads this,
it will understand the content,

15:36.583 --> 15:39.916
and assemble the radio
as easy as a toy!

15:39.958 --> 15:43.666
he's put every detail in it
with figures, Mr. Lays Charles!

15:44.416 --> 15:46.833
It's not Lays or Kurkure.
Louis Charles.

15:46.875 --> 15:48.666
Consider it a print
mistake while talking.

15:48.708 --> 15:50.083
Kindly adjust.

15:50.125 --> 15:51.291
It won't work out Alex.

15:51.333 --> 15:53.791
For 20 years, Richie hasn't even
let you touch that radio.

15:53.833 --> 15:56.458
So you're worried how
he'll allow you to repair it now.

15:56.500 --> 15:57.791
I have a plan for it.

15:57.833 --> 15:59.625
Tell me Richie's daily routine.

16:00.333 --> 16:01.875
Why? Don't you know?

16:03.625 --> 16:05.083
I want to hear it from you.

16:06.500 --> 16:07.833
What else routine will he have?

16:07.875 --> 16:10.083
At 10 am, he leaves the house.

16:10.125 --> 16:11.958
At 10:30 am, he's at Tony uncle's cafe.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.500
He leaves the cafe at 4:30 pm
and comes home at 5 pm.

16:15.625 --> 16:18.458
What if he comes
before 5 pm tomorrow?

16:19.375 --> 16:20.416
Good question.

16:21.041 --> 16:22.708
In case, Richie comes early

16:22.750 --> 16:24.541
I have an idea to avoid him.

16:24.708 --> 16:26.541
I shall park my bike
near your house.

16:26.666 --> 16:29.625
Richie has to pass your
home on the way to ours.

16:29.666 --> 16:31.833
When he spots my bike there,

16:31.875 --> 16:34.625
he will assume I'm in your
house and come there.

16:34.666 --> 16:35.875
As per the plan.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.375
The moment he comes there,
you give me information.

16:38.458 --> 16:40.958
And until I tell you,
keep Richie there.

16:41.208 --> 16:42.250
Okay?

16:42.375 --> 16:44.500
Rest will work wonders. Trust me.

16:44.583 --> 16:46.083
Okay. Done!

17:37.458 --> 17:38.500
Hello!

17:38.583 --> 17:40.708
Once you're old, that's it, my dear

17:40.875 --> 17:42.791
There won't be any pick up!

17:45.166 --> 17:46.333
Cheers!

17:47.375 --> 17:48.583
It's a joke, man

17:57.083 --> 17:58.416
Will it rain?

17:59.333 --> 18:02.375
Looks like it, Richie.

18:02.666 --> 18:05.250
- Hand me the umbrella.
- Messi, give it.

18:09.208 --> 18:12.541
- I better go before it rains.
- Yes, see you.

19:08.416 --> 19:10.541
I'm here to see Richie.
Is he there?

19:12.416 --> 19:13.583
No.

19:14.250 --> 19:17.666
I'm coming after so long,
and he's asking why I'm here. Karma.

19:19.541 --> 19:22.666
After all these days she had
to come today itself. My karma!

19:24.583 --> 19:26.000
David's bike.

19:28.291 --> 19:29.375
Okay

19:36.583 --> 19:40.291
Even if my planning goes wrong, I knew
Richie's timing won't be missed for sure.

19:40.333 --> 19:43.041
Sorry, David...mission abortion

19:49.125 --> 19:51.458
- Jessie! One moment.
- Hey, give it here

19:54.166 --> 19:56.875
'Dear Mr Murphy, congratulations.
Your plan is working out.'

19:56.916 --> 19:59.541
'As you predicted, Richie has come
to my house in search of you.'

19:59.583 --> 20:01.166
'Currently, he's batting.'

20:01.208 --> 20:04.000
'Please finish your antics fast,
or else it will be game over for you!'

20:05.750 --> 20:07.125
Richie is coming home.

20:07.166 --> 20:10.958
Jessie, the radio has to be
repaired at any cost today.

20:11.166 --> 20:14.250
Please, I'll explain later.
It might rain any moment.

20:14.291 --> 20:16.625
- David!
- You leave now, please!

20:16.666 --> 20:18.250
I just got here.
I'm not going anywhere.

20:18.291 --> 20:20.166
Jessie, please!

20:20.208 --> 20:21.750
No!

20:21.916 --> 20:23.166
Please!

20:24.291 --> 20:26.666
The umbrella is by the door.
Take it!

20:38.166 --> 20:40.208
Richie, where are you off to?
Let's watch the match.

20:40.250 --> 20:41.416
I'm not interested, man.

20:41.458 --> 20:43.166
Richie, the match...

20:44.916 --> 20:48.250
Richie, that umbrella looks like
the one you have at home.

20:48.375 --> 20:52.166
There must be 1000 such in the village.
Are they all from my home?

20:52.208 --> 20:55.666
No, Richie. Look, it is
definitely from your home.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.791
- Jessie!
- And who's holding that umbrella?

20:59.833 --> 21:01.041
That's not from your home!

21:02.291 --> 21:03.708
Is that our Jessie?

21:04.000 --> 21:05.250
Jessie!

21:06.166 --> 21:07.208
Richie

21:07.333 --> 21:09.625
There maybe many lookalikes
of our Jessie in this village!

21:09.666 --> 21:11.291
Can all Jessies be our Jessie?

21:11.333 --> 21:12.666
Ok, let it go.

21:12.750 --> 21:15.458
David's bike is here.
Where's he? At home?

21:15.708 --> 21:17.375
'This oldie asks such tough questions!'

21:17.541 --> 21:19.250
David's bike is here.

21:19.666 --> 21:21.125
Where's he? At home?

21:21.166 --> 21:22.791
I'm asking you the same!

21:22.833 --> 21:23.958
'What shall I say?'

21:24.000 --> 21:26.541
Yes. No way! No!

21:26.583 --> 21:29.291
- Either say yes. Or no.
- Jessie is home.

21:29.333 --> 21:31.041
- Don't say both!
- David isn't home.

21:31.083 --> 21:34.333
- Richie! I'll get the umbrella back for you
- Get lost!

22:54.791 --> 22:56.166
Hey, is it ready?

23:01.833 --> 23:02.916
'David.'

23:02.958 --> 23:04.333
'Tell me correctly.'

23:04.708 --> 23:07.458
Was he in the army or the CID?

23:12.958 --> 23:15.875
"Richie the tiger"

23:18.541 --> 23:21.541
"Richie the hunter"

23:24.083 --> 23:26.458
"Richie the tiger"

23:29.625 --> 23:32.666
"Richie the hunter"

23:34.166 --> 23:35.625
Hmmm...

23:39.625 --> 23:40.833
So...

23:42.541 --> 23:44.333
She had come here.

23:47.708 --> 23:48.833
Who, Richie?

23:49.416 --> 23:50.625
I know.

23:54.541 --> 23:56.666
I know you won't tell me anyway.

23:56.916 --> 24:00.583
Richie, I really don't know
who or what you're talking about.

24:00.958 --> 24:04.250
I was working in the garden
when it started to rain.

24:04.291 --> 24:08.041
And then the doorbell rang and
you both were standing there.

24:08.250 --> 24:09.416
What happened?

24:11.208 --> 24:12.875
Let me tell you something.

24:13.375 --> 24:15.541
We live in a very small town.

24:16.416 --> 24:18.375
Everyone knows everyone here.

24:19.250 --> 24:22.000
Should something go wrong,

24:23.000 --> 24:24.791
will you take responsibility for it?

24:25.958 --> 24:28.458
'Can we live with
dignity after that?'

24:28.666 --> 24:29.833
Forget about us.

24:29.875 --> 24:32.708
Have you ever thought
of that girl's future?

24:34.333 --> 24:35.958
Richie, what nonsense
are you talking?

24:36.000 --> 24:37.208
You think we're small kids?

24:37.250 --> 24:39.791
Or do you think
we're irresponsible?

24:39.958 --> 24:41.416
Richie, we're all grownups!

24:41.916 --> 24:44.041
And we very well
know what we're doing!

24:46.333 --> 24:48.000
You're all grownups now.

24:49.458 --> 24:53.500
If that girl's father gets
to know she had come here...

24:53.541 --> 24:55.916
If he does, it's fine, Richie.

24:56.458 --> 24:58.666
So what? I'll handle it.

24:58.791 --> 24:59.958
I'll do something.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
I don't see any problem here!

25:03.041 --> 25:06.500
So, she did come here!

25:09.125 --> 25:10.166
And you?

25:10.791 --> 25:12.458
'Were you waiting on them?'

25:13.333 --> 25:14.875
Are you a security guard for them!

25:14.916 --> 25:16.000
Idiot!

25:17.166 --> 25:19.208
Security guard? Me?

25:19.333 --> 25:21.541
It's useless talking to you.

25:23.083 --> 25:26.166
I know how to take
control of the situation.

25:27.125 --> 25:29.666
I shall go meet her tomorrow.

25:29.791 --> 25:32.625
Give me the duplicate
key of the house.

25:33.083 --> 25:39.666
From tomorrow, I will drop
and pick you up from college.

25:39.750 --> 25:41.083
Enough, Richie!

25:41.750 --> 25:43.000
What did you just say?

25:43.083 --> 25:44.250
You'll control everything?

25:44.291 --> 25:45.958
What do you take us for?

25:46.166 --> 25:48.250
You think I'm a radio
which you can control?

25:48.708 --> 25:50.375
He'll drop me and
pick me up it seems!

25:50.458 --> 25:54.583
I'm not a child to do that!
Nor are you my father!

25:54.875 --> 25:56.375
- You're not my father!
- 'David!'

25:56.416 --> 25:58.416
And, in fact you
can never be one!

25:59.291 --> 26:00.291
Shucks!

26:00.333 --> 26:01.458
David!

26:31.208 --> 26:32.333
Richie...

26:39.208 --> 26:40.291
Hi, David!

26:41.375 --> 26:42.708
My boy.

26:43.416 --> 26:44.625
Alex!

26:50.333 --> 26:51.583
Hi, Jessie.

26:56.708 --> 26:58.041
Sorry...

27:01.708 --> 27:03.041
What happened, David?

27:05.083 --> 27:06.291
What's the matter, dude?

27:06.333 --> 27:07.583
Just tell me!

27:07.625 --> 27:09.750
What do you call
someone who unites lovers?

27:11.958 --> 27:13.416
They call him messenger of God.

27:13.500 --> 27:15.125
Isn't it?

27:16.125 --> 27:18.708
You know what Richie
called me for uniting them?

27:18.750 --> 27:20.000
What did he say?

27:21.583 --> 27:22.875
Security guard it seems.

27:22.958 --> 27:24.708
He called me a security guard!

27:25.125 --> 27:26.708
You united them both?

27:26.750 --> 27:28.333
Yes, exactly.

27:33.500 --> 27:34.958
You are a security guard, dude!

27:35.166 --> 27:37.083
For sure a security guard!

27:38.666 --> 27:41.333
- Hey, stop it you both.
- David.

27:41.541 --> 27:42.916
Why are you so worried?

27:43.833 --> 27:45.833
You know Richie, right?

27:45.875 --> 27:48.666
You can't change
what has happened. Drop it!

27:49.250 --> 27:50.291
No, Jessie.

27:50.375 --> 27:52.291
Somehow we managed it so far.

27:52.875 --> 27:54.375
Now it's destroyed!

27:55.166 --> 27:57.958
David, look here.
Listen to me.

27:58.166 --> 28:01.250
In fact, you did all of this
to give it as a gift to Richie, right?

28:02.166 --> 28:04.708
But now, don't feel
bad about it, David.

28:05.458 --> 28:09.583
Before he discovers
that the radio is conked,

28:09.625 --> 28:11.916
it's better you apologise
and tell him the truth.

28:12.416 --> 28:14.166
'Maximum, what can happen?'

28:14.208 --> 28:16.458
He might get angry and
not talk for a few days.

28:16.833 --> 28:18.541
I'm sure he'll forgive you.

28:18.791 --> 28:23.041
Besides, there's no shame
in asking Richie for forgiveness.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.416
'The heart needs to mend quickly'

28:29.375 --> 28:31.250
'We are the blind horses'

28:31.666 --> 28:33.708
'While only memories ride our back'

28:34.583 --> 28:36.291
'Neither we are stepping back'

28:36.333 --> 28:37.916
'Nor are we lamenting'

28:38.583 --> 28:41.041
'We are just running breathlessly'

28:42.000 --> 28:43.750
'Clinging on to the bygones,'

28:43.875 --> 28:45.791
'we have forgotten
those who are here for us.'

28:46.708 --> 28:48.375
'to talk a little'

28:48.583 --> 28:50.291
'Need to equip'

28:51.833 --> 28:55.291
'The heart needs to mend quickly'

28:56.541 --> 28:58.500
'We are the blind horses'

28:59.125 --> 29:03.875
'While only memories ride our back'

29:24.791 --> 29:25.833
Richie...

31:24.041 --> 31:25.041
Richie...

31:27.416 --> 31:28.625
Richie...

32:19.166 --> 32:20.250
Shucks!

32:21.000 --> 32:22.041
Dammit!

32:33.541 --> 32:35.958
'Alex you fool! Bloody fool!'

32:39.208 --> 32:40.500
Richie will kill me

32:40.541 --> 32:42.708
'Hey! Is he crazy?'

32:42.750 --> 32:44.958
'He's switched it on and
is screaming like a mad man!'

32:45.000 --> 32:46.500
'You and your radio!'

32:46.541 --> 32:48.125
'We're getting late for practicals.'

32:48.166 --> 32:50.000
'It's the last day to submit our project.'

32:50.041 --> 32:53.583
'And today is physics practicals.
Your favourite!'

32:53.750 --> 32:54.958
'Hey, but it's not him today.'

32:55.000 --> 32:59.250
'- It's Lawrence sir today.
- If he doesn't come, will you bunk?'

32:59.291 --> 33:02.958
'Do I have to get dressed to see Lawrence?
I'm sorry. You guys go.'

33:03.000 --> 33:04.625
'Okay! Bye.'

33:05.916 --> 33:08.208
Can you hear me?

33:10.916 --> 33:12.000
Hello?

33:13.250 --> 33:14.583
'Who are you?'

33:15.083 --> 33:16.166
Hello?

33:16.416 --> 33:18.375
'I...I'm Janani.'

33:18.583 --> 33:20.583
'So did you hear
everything I said?'

33:21.125 --> 33:23.083
'Must have been a cross connection.'

33:24.416 --> 33:25.666
'Strange, isn't it?'

33:26.416 --> 33:27.500
'Who are you?'

33:27.541 --> 33:29.375
'- What's your name?
- Nanda? (mine?)

33:29.875 --> 33:31.750
Mr Nanda.

33:31.875 --> 33:34.791
- Sorry, I kept blabbering.
- No!

33:35.166 --> 33:36.875
My name is David.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.625
'Ho...Ok.'

33:38.666 --> 33:41.541
Actually, it is quite strange.

33:42.125 --> 33:46.333
'These cross connections happen
only with devices in one's area'

33:46.375 --> 33:49.541
By an chance,
are you from my area?

33:49.625 --> 33:51.833
'Your area? Which one?'

33:52.666 --> 33:53.833
Aldona.

33:54.041 --> 33:56.500
'Hey! I live in Aldona!'

33:59.000 --> 34:01.166
Really? No wonder!

34:01.500 --> 34:03.291
That's why the cross connection!

34:04.208 --> 34:06.791
In a strange way,
to get connected.

34:07.083 --> 34:08.500
Anyway

34:08.583 --> 34:10.041
By the way, what do you do?

34:10.291 --> 34:12.791
'I'm doing my Bachelors at Aloysius.'

34:15.166 --> 34:16.208
Wow!

34:16.500 --> 34:17.750
Which department?

34:17.791 --> 34:19.500
'PCM, 2ND YEAR.'

34:20.583 --> 34:23.041
Ok, I don't know what to say...

34:23.208 --> 34:24.416
You know what?

34:24.458 --> 34:25.750
I'm your senior.

34:26.041 --> 34:28.625
I'm in third year Electricals.

34:29.458 --> 34:31.833
So your name is Janani, right?

34:32.291 --> 34:34.166
Can you tell me your full name?

34:34.208 --> 34:35.791
'Janani Chandrashekhar'

34:38.708 --> 34:40.500
Miss Janani Chandrashekhar

34:40.750 --> 34:43.000
Are you sure you're from PCM?

34:43.041 --> 34:46.291
Because, I have some friends in PCM.

34:46.333 --> 34:49.083
But I've never heard
them mention you.

34:49.125 --> 34:50.416
'Really?'

34:50.791 --> 34:52.458
'Even I've never heard of you.'

34:52.583 --> 34:54.458
'Are you sure you're
from this college?'

34:54.791 --> 34:57.166
I think there's a lot of confusion.

34:57.708 --> 34:59.125
Can we catch up?

34:59.875 --> 35:01.333
Can I get your number?

35:01.708 --> 35:05.666
'I knew it the moment you asked,
'where are you from,'

35:05.708 --> 35:09.958
'which department, let's meet and
now finally phone number.'

35:10.000 --> 35:11.458
'What next? Love?'

35:11.500 --> 35:14.541
'- The moment it's a girl...'
- Hello, I have a girlfriend.

35:14.791 --> 35:16.833
She's very beautiful
and I'm sorted.

35:17.583 --> 35:20.041
I'm not looking to
make friends with you,

35:20.083 --> 35:22.083
or falling in love.

35:22.125 --> 35:23.958
Not interested!

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
It's a cross connection, yes.
And we are in the same college.

35:27.041 --> 35:31.000
So, I want to see your
radio at least once, please!

35:31.083 --> 35:32.333
If you don't mind.

35:32.541 --> 35:36.291
'Okay. At the college sitout.
Sharp 11 am.'

35:36.416 --> 35:38.083
Done! Thank you.

35:38.791 --> 35:40.875
But how do I identify you?

35:41.333 --> 35:42.333
'Bye!'

35:45.875 --> 35:48.208
Miss Janani Chandrashekhar...

35:49.500 --> 35:50.500
Hello?

35:51.666 --> 35:52.666
Hello!

36:03.833 --> 36:04.916
David!

36:06.958 --> 36:08.000
Je...Jessie!

36:08.291 --> 36:09.791
Why did you come here?

36:10.208 --> 36:13.583
Who else can come into
your life, except for me?

36:14.208 --> 36:15.333
And by the way,

36:15.375 --> 36:18.541
- Isn't your practicals next week?
- Jessie, I was waiting for a girl.

36:18.625 --> 36:20.708
So that's why I was waiting here.

36:22.875 --> 36:24.458
So there's already someone?

36:25.041 --> 36:26.166
Not bad, David!

36:26.958 --> 36:30.166
I just merely teased
you about another girl...

36:30.833 --> 36:32.416
Wow! This is news to me.

36:32.458 --> 36:33.666
- Jessie!
- Good!

36:33.708 --> 36:34.750
What am I trying to say...

36:34.791 --> 36:36.375
and what you are saying,
I have no clue.

36:36.416 --> 36:39.041
What am I talking? Me?

36:39.500 --> 36:41.625
Okay sir, what's madam's name?

36:41.791 --> 36:44.000
- Jessie!
- What's her name?

36:45.000 --> 36:46.458
Jessie, what...

36:48.833 --> 36:50.291
Her name is Janani. But Jessie...

36:50.333 --> 36:51.416
Enough!

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
I got it.

36:54.041 --> 36:55.375
Leave me!

36:55.791 --> 36:56.958
Janani, listen.

36:58.541 --> 36:59.958
Janani?

37:00.000 --> 37:02.875
- Jessie, let me explain.
- Janani? No, David.

37:02.958 --> 37:03.958
You know what?

37:07.208 --> 37:09.333
Janani. Jessie.

37:09.750 --> 37:11.958
Ah! Women!

38:02.250 --> 38:03.833
'Oh, Mr David!'

38:04.000 --> 38:05.125
'Are you here?'

38:05.250 --> 38:10.166
- I am! Don't you have any humanity?
'- Absolutely no humanity!'

38:10.208 --> 38:11.750
Just because
I respect you as a girl...

38:11.791 --> 38:14.458
You make a girl wait and play a joke!

38:14.541 --> 38:15.958
What kind of
a person are you, man?

38:16.000 --> 38:18.333
'What kind of a person
are you, Mr David!'

38:19.500 --> 38:22.208
Done? You're repeating
everything I want to say!

38:22.250 --> 38:24.875
- I've been waiting since 11 am!
'- Since 11 am,'

38:24.916 --> 38:28.041
'I've been roaming around
like a fool with this radio!'

38:28.083 --> 38:29.750
Exactly! That's my question.

38:29.875 --> 38:31.666
Actually, I'm angry for two reasons.

38:31.708 --> 38:33.208
One, for making you wait like a fool.

38:33.250 --> 38:35.958
- The other is, all your dialogues were mine!
- Yeah, whatever!

38:36.000 --> 38:37.958
Including the word "humanity."

38:38.625 --> 38:40.458
Janani, tell me correctly.

38:40.541 --> 38:42.625
- Are you really from my college or...
- No!

38:42.750 --> 38:45.791
'Definitely not! You are
not from my college!'

38:45.875 --> 38:48.125
'Because I'm studying
in St Aloysius college.'

38:48.166 --> 38:49.791
'Such a bloody liar!'

38:50.833 --> 38:51.833
I'm lying?

38:51.875 --> 38:53.583
I've been waiting since morning!
And you know what?

38:53.625 --> 38:54.791
I almost broke up with Jessie.

38:54.833 --> 38:56.791
- 'You're the bloody reason!'
- Jessie?

38:56.833 --> 38:58.000
A girlfriend, too?

38:58.041 --> 39:02.375
'You're the only one with a girlfriend.
We're all monks. We too have commitments.'

39:02.500 --> 39:05.541
'I couldn't even go to my department.
I had to meet my lecturer...'

39:05.583 --> 39:07.291
There's no need for this discussion.

39:07.375 --> 39:10.125
Just send me a picture
on Whatsapp. I'll identify it.

39:10.208 --> 39:12.041
'- Huh? What is that?'
- Whatsapp.

39:12.125 --> 39:13.875
On Whatsapp...ok, forget it.

39:13.916 --> 39:16.083
What's your ID on Instagram?
Tell me your Insta ID.

39:16.125 --> 39:17.250
'Whatsapp?'

39:17.500 --> 39:18.708
'What is that?'

39:18.833 --> 39:21.000
'Do you even know
what you're saying?'

39:21.083 --> 39:22.791
God knows what time
& age you're living in!

39:24.250 --> 39:26.458
Whatsapp. Instagram.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.833
You don't even have Whatsapp?

39:29.083 --> 39:32.041
Do one thing. Just ask the person
next to you to install it on your phone.

39:32.333 --> 39:33.375
'Sir'

39:33.458 --> 39:36.250
'I don't want any installment or loans.'

39:36.416 --> 39:39.333
'It's goodbye to you and the radio!'

39:39.500 --> 39:40.583
'Just leave me alone.'

39:40.625 --> 39:41.666
You don't have a phone?

39:41.708 --> 39:45.166
'Yes, the hostel number.
Only the warden uses it.'

39:45.250 --> 39:47.208
I'll give it to you. Have fun!'

39:47.250 --> 39:50.375
Oh god! Feels like I'm talking
to someone in the 90s!

39:50.416 --> 39:54.333
'In the 90s, obviously we'll talk
like it's the 90S. Not the Stone Age!'

39:55.250 --> 39:57.500
Yeah right! And you
want me to believe this!

39:57.541 --> 39:59.625
'Your belief doesn't matter to me!'

39:59.833 --> 40:02.416
'I've been tolerating you for long.
You speak nonsense!'

40:02.458 --> 40:04.833
Are you aware of
what you're saying?

40:05.083 --> 40:09.041
Or have you had a head injury and
woken up from a coma after 25 years?

40:09.083 --> 40:10.750
Ask somebody who is next to you!

40:10.791 --> 40:13.833
'Enough David. I have
heard enough of you.'

40:14.083 --> 40:16.875
'I want to watch the World Cup match.
I have to go. Bye.'

40:17.166 --> 40:19.125
Wait! World Cup?

40:19.291 --> 40:20.875
Betting on the highlights itself!

40:21.333 --> 40:22.666
Super, I appreciate it

40:22.750 --> 40:26.416
'David, stop bullshitting.
You're seriously irritating me!'

40:26.458 --> 40:27.958
'There's a limit to joking.'

40:28.000 --> 40:31.166
'Talking to you, I've
missed half the innings!'

40:31.208 --> 40:32.625
'Please let me go!'

40:32.708 --> 40:34.708
The team has already
won and is back home.

40:34.791 --> 40:36.583
What will you do watching
the highlights now?

40:36.625 --> 40:40.833
Hello, even I know they'll win...
But I want to see my Sachin making us win.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.041
Tendulkar?

40:47.333 --> 40:49.458
He retired in 2013!

40:49.541 --> 40:52.291
Why will he come now and
win the World Cup for you?

40:55.041 --> 40:56.250
Do one thing,

40:56.333 --> 40:58.958
I think you need to
get mentally checked!

41:08.333 --> 41:09.875
- Janani...
- How could you?

41:10.416 --> 41:11.708
Are you crying?

41:11.833 --> 41:13.041
'How could you?'

41:14.375 --> 41:16.333
Okay, listen.

41:16.791 --> 41:17.875
I'm sorry.

41:18.166 --> 41:21.750
'You're making
fun of me, it's okay.'

41:22.875 --> 41:24.541
'But my Sacchu?'

41:24.791 --> 41:26.083
Sacchu?

41:26.500 --> 41:27.750
'Enough.'

41:28.291 --> 41:31.041
'- I can't bear this pain.'
- Janani, listen.

41:31.208 --> 41:33.083
I'm so sorry! Correct.

41:33.875 --> 41:35.250
Whatever you're saying is correct.

41:35.291 --> 41:36.791
Actually, I'm unable to understand.

41:37.708 --> 41:38.791
Okay.

41:38.833 --> 41:40.083
You're watching the match, right?

41:40.125 --> 41:42.583
At least, can you tell
me which one it is?

41:42.875 --> 41:47.125
'World Cup semi finals.
India vs Sri Lanka.'

41:49.000 --> 41:50.250
India vs Sri Lanka.

41:50.708 --> 41:52.000
Highlights, right?

41:52.250 --> 41:55.500
13th March 1996 and it is live!

41:57.500 --> 41:59.041
- Live?
- 'Yes'

41:59.125 --> 42:01.041
'And thanks for making me cry!'

42:01.708 --> 42:02.750
Look

42:02.916 --> 42:04.000
I'm sorry.

42:04.250 --> 42:07.583
Janani, I'm finding it so
hard to believe this...

42:07.666 --> 42:09.625
As much as you being in 1996 is true,

42:09.708 --> 42:11.750
me being in 2024 is just as true.

42:11.791 --> 42:13.291
And I can prove that to you.

42:13.583 --> 42:15.208
'Oh! New story!'

42:15.458 --> 42:17.291
'Let's get it aired
on Surabhi (90s TV programme)'

42:17.333 --> 42:20.291
'For your kind information,
it was not so nice to speak to you, bye'

42:20.333 --> 42:23.250
Janani! One moment, please!

42:23.583 --> 42:27.000
You can erase these 10 minutes
from your life, later. Please!

42:27.125 --> 42:28.583
One last chance, okay?

42:30.291 --> 42:31.416
Janani?

42:32.666 --> 42:33.833
'Yeah...'

42:33.875 --> 42:35.333
Okay, yeah.

42:37.208 --> 42:38.750
'How much longer?'

42:39.625 --> 42:41.291
One moment. The Net speed...

42:41.875 --> 42:44.791
'talking about internet
speed with a pager, karma'

42:46.166 --> 42:47.583
'I have to go'

42:48.416 --> 42:49.916
'David, I can't wait.'

42:52.166 --> 42:53.541
I'm extremely sorry.

42:55.125 --> 42:56.250
In the 34th over,

42:56.291 --> 42:57.583
a fight breaks out.

42:57.875 --> 42:59.041
And the audience

42:59.083 --> 43:00.458
begin to throw bottles.

43:01.791 --> 43:04.500
Keeping all the safety &
security issues in mind,

43:05.041 --> 43:06.458
based on the run rate,

43:06.750 --> 43:08.833
Sri Lanka is declared as the winner.

43:08.875 --> 43:11.166
'What? To hell with you, man!'

43:11.666 --> 43:13.458
What? To hell with me?

43:17.416 --> 43:18.541
Okay.

43:19.458 --> 43:20.708
Miss Janani

43:21.083 --> 43:23.916
Tomorrow same place, same time

43:24.500 --> 43:26.291
you will be back for sure.

43:26.333 --> 43:28.083
And agree to everything I said.

43:29.333 --> 43:30.458
Wanna take a bet?

43:30.500 --> 43:32.625
'Yeah, I'll come running.'

43:32.833 --> 43:34.041
'Keep dreaming.'

43:35.625 --> 43:36.791
I'll be waiting!

43:48.375 --> 43:51.375
'Is she lying or am I delusional?'

44:52.458 --> 44:53.875
Wow!

45:28.250 --> 45:31.000
'In the 34th over, a fight breaks out.'

45:32.541 --> 45:34.875
'The audience will begin throwing bottles.'

45:37.958 --> 45:40.708
'Keeping all safety and
security issues in mind,'

45:41.208 --> 45:42.666
'based on the run rate,'

45:42.916 --> 45:45.166
'Sri Lanka is declared as the winner.'

46:26.500 --> 46:27.583
'David...'

46:51.708 --> 46:54.291
'Richie, good morning.
Where are you? What you upto?'

46:54.333 --> 46:59.125
'I'll be anywhere I want and with whoever
I want. That is none of your business.'

46:59.166 --> 47:00.666
Richie, why are you
getting angry now?

47:00.708 --> 47:03.458
'Are you my father to ask me all this?
You're not my father.'

47:03.500 --> 47:05.708
'In fact, you can never be one.'

47:05.750 --> 47:06.875
Oh! Counter dialogue.

47:32.500 --> 47:33.625
'Janani...'

47:37.541 --> 47:39.083
David, are you there?

47:39.125 --> 47:40.166
'Yeah'

47:40.791 --> 47:42.250
Did you watch the match?

47:44.375 --> 47:45.833
Sri Lanka won, isn't it?

47:46.291 --> 47:47.833
There was a fight, too.

47:48.333 --> 47:50.333
'- Kambli was crying.'
- Yes, I told you!

47:50.750 --> 47:52.250
But, how David?

47:52.291 --> 47:53.958
Because I'm from the future.

47:55.625 --> 47:57.666
But I'm unable to believe you.

47:58.375 --> 47:59.750
I'm scared.

48:00.000 --> 48:01.833
'Janani, why should you be scared?'

48:02.291 --> 48:05.250
Something unique is
happening between us.

48:05.458 --> 48:06.833
Don't you think this is magical?

48:06.875 --> 48:09.541
Don't you think there
is a greater purpose to it?

48:09.666 --> 48:11.500
Whatever the purpose may be,

48:11.625 --> 48:13.875
I'm having a hard
time believing it.

48:14.750 --> 48:18.666
Is this even real
or a mere illusion?

48:19.708 --> 48:20.875
But how?

48:22.125 --> 48:23.125
Janani

48:23.208 --> 48:25.625
How and why it happened is
something even I don't know.

48:25.833 --> 48:27.000
But the fact is that

48:27.041 --> 48:28.375
this has happened.

48:28.541 --> 48:32.833
There's a saying that one must
never question the origins of a monk.

48:32.916 --> 48:36.250
Likewise, let's not
get into the details.

48:36.333 --> 48:38.875
'Even we don't know how long
this radio will function this way.'

48:39.875 --> 48:41.750
'So until it lasts,
let's happily talk!'

48:42.000 --> 48:43.416
The day it stops working,

48:44.583 --> 48:47.291
we will think of it as
a miracle and cherish it.

48:47.333 --> 48:49.625
'Also, there's a terror in my house.'

48:49.666 --> 48:52.250
'It's my grandpa & he should never
get to know about this radio.'

48:52.291 --> 48:53.833
'So we talk between
11 am & 4 pm, okay?'

48:53.875 --> 48:55.708
- 'Okay...'
- Okay...

48:56.875 --> 48:58.125
What next?

48:58.958 --> 49:02.375
Every day, conversations from
the past to the future will be on.

49:02.708 --> 49:04.291
I'll introduce my friends to you.

49:05.166 --> 49:07.583
And you introduce your
friends to me, that's it.

49:09.083 --> 49:10.375
David...

49:10.416 --> 49:13.875
To be honest, I don't have
friends who will believe all this.

49:14.541 --> 49:18.083
And no close friends at all.

49:19.791 --> 49:21.416
I'm actually an orphan.

49:23.083 --> 49:25.416
'Think of me as a lone soul.'

49:25.666 --> 49:26.916
That's okay!

49:26.958 --> 49:28.916
I have a very good bunch of friends

49:28.958 --> 49:30.500
I'll introduce you to them.

49:30.541 --> 49:33.541
And now on you must never
think you have no friends.

49:33.583 --> 49:35.208
That's how I'll treat you!

49:35.250 --> 49:36.541
Let's talk everyday!

49:37.041 --> 49:38.125
What say?

49:39.541 --> 49:40.625
Okay!

49:42.500 --> 49:43.791
So tell me

49:43.833 --> 49:45.333
Is Jessie your girlfriend?

49:48.125 --> 49:49.166
Yeah.

49:49.250 --> 49:51.291
Jessie is my girlfriend.

50:01.041 --> 50:04.083
"O mind, like a flower"

50:04.125 --> 50:07.125
"Journey forth"

50:08.958 --> 50:14.375
"Journey forth with joy"

50:17.000 --> 50:18.791
"O gentle breeze"

50:18.833 --> 50:20.083
"Convey the message"

50:20.125 --> 50:23.750
"convey it softly"

50:25.125 --> 50:30.541
"Journey forth with joy"

50:32.416 --> 50:35.875
"Every day a newness"

50:36.333 --> 50:39.916
"An embrace, again and again"

50:40.541 --> 50:44.291
"Why stand so far away, my dear"

50:44.333 --> 50:47.000
"when I sing?"

50:47.291 --> 50:49.000
'This poem is so beautiful!'

50:49.208 --> 50:50.541
Specially this line

50:52.125 --> 50:54.791
'Nanna Preetige
Ninna Bennu Sothiralu'

50:56.208 --> 50:57.416
So romantic.

50:57.833 --> 50:59.000
Where was this?

50:59.166 --> 51:01.000
I have never seen this before.

51:01.625 --> 51:02.625
I know.

51:02.875 --> 51:04.000
It's beautiful.

51:04.875 --> 51:07.250
Actually, I found it
while cleaning my room.

51:07.333 --> 51:08.833
I didn't want to discard it.

51:08.875 --> 51:10.000
So I have kept it.

51:12.125 --> 51:14.125
Have you ever written a poem for me?

51:17.541 --> 51:18.583
Tell me.

51:19.125 --> 51:21.125
Where should I write it?
On paper or...

51:23.708 --> 51:25.583
"Time..."

51:25.666 --> 51:27.541
"Oh time..."

51:27.583 --> 51:29.583
"remember"

51:29.666 --> 51:31.458
"my friend"

51:31.708 --> 51:33.583
"Time..."

51:33.666 --> 51:35.625
"Oh time..."

51:35.666 --> 51:37.666
"soothe"

51:37.708 --> 51:39.500
"this heart"

51:52.541 --> 51:53.583
- David
- Yes.

51:53.958 --> 51:55.291
I'll tell you something

51:55.791 --> 51:57.958
- 'Hmm...!'
- You will not tell anyone else, right?

51:58.708 --> 51:59.750
Dumbo!

51:59.833 --> 52:02.291
What difference will it make
to you if I tell anyone about it?

52:02.791 --> 52:03.875
You're right.

52:04.208 --> 52:05.333
- David
- 'Hmm...!'

52:06.041 --> 52:07.625
There's a person called Joe.

52:07.666 --> 52:08.666
'Hmm...!'

52:08.833 --> 52:10.500
The first time I saw him,

52:11.125 --> 52:13.166
I could feel some
strong connection.

52:13.958 --> 52:16.000
I approached him
wanting to talk but,

52:17.625 --> 52:19.208
I can't summon
the courage to do so.

52:19.333 --> 52:21.458
Yet, whenever he's around

52:21.875 --> 52:23.541
I feel so happy!

52:27.583 --> 52:28.958
Don't know, David

52:29.833 --> 52:30.875
Okay...

52:30.958 --> 52:35.708
So this great man Joe,
may I know who is he exactly?

52:36.791 --> 52:38.166
Physics

52:38.291 --> 52:39.416
Guest

52:40.041 --> 52:41.083
Lecturer.

52:41.541 --> 52:43.000
Physics lecturer?

52:43.041 --> 52:44.333
Are you serious?

52:44.708 --> 52:47.708
I keep going to him with
an excuse of having doubts,

52:47.875 --> 52:49.208
but I'm unable to.

52:49.833 --> 52:52.291
Because I can't figure
even the P in Physics!

52:52.375 --> 52:54.250
So, Miss Janani

52:54.833 --> 52:59.166
now is your problem Physics,

52:59.291 --> 53:01.583
or the Chemistry with him?

53:01.625 --> 53:07.583
If I flunk in Physics, forget chemistry,
my love story will remain a mystery.

53:08.875 --> 53:12.666
Joe and your love story will not
become a mystery, but create history!

53:12.708 --> 53:14.625
I bet you! Watch out.

53:14.791 --> 53:16.708
David, please David!

53:16.791 --> 53:18.791
Oh my Issac Newton Janani!

53:18.916 --> 53:21.416
I can easily find
the 1996 question paper!

53:21.458 --> 53:24.125
Because I am in the future!
Think about it!

53:24.166 --> 53:25.208
Yes!

53:55.875 --> 53:59.375
"The stars in the sky"

53:59.875 --> 54:01.208
"like us"

54:01.833 --> 54:03.458
"again and again"

54:03.958 --> 54:07.750
"Like the ever-shining love,
we are forever"

54:07.875 --> 54:10.333
"Isn't it beautiful?"

54:12.583 --> 54:14.458
"Time..."

54:14.500 --> 54:16.375
"Oh time..."

54:16.458 --> 54:18.458
"remember"

54:18.541 --> 54:20.333
"my friend"

54:20.500 --> 54:22.375
"Time..."

54:22.416 --> 54:24.291
"savoring every moment"

54:24.458 --> 54:26.458
"soothe"

54:26.541 --> 54:28.333
"my friend"

54:28.625 --> 54:31.250
"O mind, like a flower"

54:31.583 --> 54:34.583
"Journey forth"

54:36.583 --> 54:41.791
"Journey forth with joy"

54:44.541 --> 54:46.208
"O gentle breeze"

54:46.250 --> 54:47.666
"Convey the message"

54:47.750 --> 54:50.791
"Convey it softly"

54:52.583 --> 54:57.875
"Journey forth with joy"

55:00.500 --> 55:02.375
"Time..."

55:02.416 --> 55:04.291
"Oh time..."

55:04.375 --> 55:06.375
"remember"

55:06.416 --> 55:08.208
"my friend"

55:08.500 --> 55:10.375
"Time..."

55:10.458 --> 55:12.333
"savoring every moment"

55:12.375 --> 55:14.375
"soothe"

55:14.500 --> 55:16.291
"my friend"

55:23.833 --> 55:24.875
David...

55:26.083 --> 55:27.416
David, are you there?

55:29.666 --> 55:31.083
'Can you hear me?'

55:32.416 --> 55:33.833
'David, speak!'

55:36.208 --> 55:37.958
'David, I know you're here.'

55:41.208 --> 55:42.333
'Sorry, David.'

55:43.416 --> 55:45.250
'I know you're angry with me.'

55:45.333 --> 55:49.250
'But, I was not in a place
to explain anything to you.'

55:49.833 --> 55:51.541
'I was extremely tensed.'

55:52.500 --> 55:54.041
'However tensed you might be,'

55:54.083 --> 55:55.541
just one small information.

55:55.625 --> 55:57.958
You have no idea about
what I went through!

55:58.291 --> 56:02.333
Except for this radio, I have
no means to talk or even see you!

56:02.916 --> 56:04.375
'How can you
just disappear like that!'

56:04.416 --> 56:05.625
'What should I conclude?'

56:05.666 --> 56:07.625
Joe met with an accident, David.

56:12.458 --> 56:13.875
'But he's fine now.'

56:15.208 --> 56:16.958
'I...I am really sorry.'

56:17.458 --> 56:19.791
'I just blabbered without
knowing the facts.'

56:21.708 --> 56:23.041
It's okay, David.

56:23.083 --> 56:24.375
It's you after all.

56:24.625 --> 56:26.875
Probably if I were in this situation,

56:27.083 --> 56:29.208
my reaction would
have probably been worse.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.416
But, how did all of
this happen, Janani?

56:33.958 --> 56:36.833
All of a sudden, I got to know
Joe is leaving the college.

56:37.500 --> 56:39.958
'We organised a farewell
and gave him a send-off.'

56:40.791 --> 56:43.166
Just after he left college,

56:43.500 --> 56:45.583
I got to know
he met with an accident.

56:49.833 --> 56:51.791
I felt so bad for him.

56:52.416 --> 56:56.666
Before the accident, everyone had
gone to click photos with him.

56:57.250 --> 57:01.416
But I didn't have the guts to
approach him with a sad face.

57:01.875 --> 57:03.958
So I stood behind
a pillar and cried.

57:04.500 --> 57:06.875
'I think he waited for me'

57:07.416 --> 57:08.833
'But I didn't go.'

57:10.208 --> 57:12.291
Had I gone to him then,

57:12.416 --> 57:14.541
he'd have probably
escaped the accident.

57:16.791 --> 57:18.250
It's all my mistake.

57:18.458 --> 57:21.333
Janani, please don't say that.

57:21.875 --> 57:23.416
It's not in your hands!

57:24.375 --> 57:26.291
Okay.
Where is he now?

57:26.375 --> 57:29.791
We took him to the hospital.

57:29.833 --> 57:31.458
Tried calling his parents.

57:31.500 --> 57:33.125
But they weren't in town.

57:34.750 --> 57:36.625
So it was my responsibility.

57:37.625 --> 57:39.333
I had to stay there
and look after him.

57:40.166 --> 57:42.416
- 'You know how it feels...'
- I'm sorry to say this, but

57:43.000 --> 57:47.041
I feel luck took a U-turn
to work in your favour!

57:48.125 --> 57:49.208
So tell me.

57:50.166 --> 57:52.750
Was it just taking care or...!

57:53.666 --> 57:54.750
Shut up!

57:55.416 --> 57:57.375
Nothing of that sort happened.

57:58.791 --> 58:00.875
'I've written a poem for him.'

58:01.958 --> 58:04.541
I've expressed my feelings in it.

58:06.000 --> 58:07.875
I hope he reads it...

58:09.583 --> 58:11.500
Wow! Interesting!

58:11.958 --> 58:16.041
I see that the chemistry has
worked out in your love story!

58:17.708 --> 58:20.666
Okay. Recite your poem.
I'll listen.

58:20.958 --> 58:22.750
I'm feeling shy...

58:23.083 --> 58:24.958
What if you laugh
after listening to it?

58:25.750 --> 58:28.125
I'll try to use it in my love story.

58:28.791 --> 58:29.875
Are you sure?

58:30.125 --> 58:32.708
'If it's nice, I'll definitely use it.'

58:33.041 --> 58:34.333
'David! Come on!'

58:34.875 --> 58:36.083
Sorry! Ok,

58:36.583 --> 58:37.708
Please recite.

58:41.500 --> 58:43.333
"The roaring whispers"

58:44.166 --> 58:45.916
"While I watch over thee,"

58:46.041 --> 58:48.041
"when will thou lead me,"

58:48.125 --> 58:50.541
"asked the roaring whispers."

58:50.958 --> 58:53.833
"Like a shadow that never questions"

58:54.000 --> 58:57.166
"when will I follow thee,
asked the roaring whispers."

58:57.750 --> 58:59.916
"Can I be the melody
of thy laughter"

59:00.125 --> 59:04.166
"for a diminutive epoch
asked the roaring whispers"

59:05.500 --> 59:08.083
"You would shy away at
the very glimpse of his ear mole"

59:08.625 --> 59:13.500
"when will you mutter thy love,
smirked the roaring whispers."

59:15.375 --> 59:18.291
"While I am lost in thy love,"

59:19.250 --> 59:23.833
"when will you lose yourself to me,
asked the roaring whispers"

59:26.000 --> 59:29.291
"When will thee, like every
membrane of thou heart,"

59:31.500 --> 59:35.875
"endear me asked
the roaring whispers"

59:36.916 --> 59:40.125
"When will I like the melting dew,"

59:41.625 --> 59:46.166
"at the ray of dawn flux
asked the roaring whispers."

59:46.875 --> 59:48.916
"Gushing and roaring"

59:49.291 --> 59:50.958
"Paving into the heart"

59:51.833 --> 59:53.458
"Beaming into a smile
Fighting the blush"

59:53.500 --> 59:55.083
"Trembling and tiptoeing"

59:55.791 --> 59:58.333
"Just before returning "

59:59.833 --> 01:00:01.666
"Shied away beautifully"

01:00:03.125 --> 01:00:05.125
"The roaring whispers"

01:00:07.083 --> 01:00:08.208
David

01:00:11.958 --> 01:00:13.208
'How do you...'

01:00:15.083 --> 01:00:16.125
Janani...

01:00:17.625 --> 01:00:18.791
'David'

01:00:24.208 --> 01:00:25.541
By any chance

01:00:26.708 --> 01:00:27.833
is your Joe

01:00:28.541 --> 01:00:29.333
Is

01:00:29.375 --> 01:00:30.958
Joseph Richard Murphy?

01:00:33.125 --> 01:00:34.166
'Yes...'

01:00:34.625 --> 01:00:35.708
'But...'

01:00:36.625 --> 01:00:38.250
'David, how do you know this?'

01:00:38.958 --> 01:00:40.041
'Joe.'

01:00:41.458 --> 01:00:42.958
'And...and the poem?'

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
'I wrote this two days ago!'

01:00:49.666 --> 01:00:51.333
'How do you already know it?'

01:00:52.583 --> 01:00:53.625
'Oh god!'

01:00:54.458 --> 01:00:55.541
'I'm confused.'

01:00:55.833 --> 01:00:57.000
'David'

01:00:57.375 --> 01:00:59.583
'Please say something!'

01:00:59.791 --> 01:01:02.041
'I'm not understanding
what's happening,'

01:01:02.166 --> 01:01:03.958
'Don't be quiet, please!'

01:01:04.041 --> 01:01:05.041
Janani

01:01:05.875 --> 01:01:07.500
The poem you've written

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:11.958
- Is in my hand
- David...

01:01:14.666 --> 01:01:17.958
And Joseph Richard Murphy

01:01:23.041 --> 01:01:24.083
is my father.

01:01:57.375 --> 01:01:59.625
Joseph Richard Murphy is my father.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.041
'David...'

01:02:27.541 --> 01:02:29.500
'David, please say something!'

01:02:29.958 --> 01:02:32.291
'I am unable to understand
what's happening!'

01:02:32.541 --> 01:02:34.125
'Don't be quiet, please!'

01:02:34.416 --> 01:02:35.416
Janani...

01:02:36.208 --> 01:02:37.916
The poem you've written...

01:02:39.791 --> 01:02:42.250
- Is in my hand
- David...

01:02:44.958 --> 01:02:48.125
And Joseph Richard Murphy

01:02:53.416 --> 01:02:54.500
...is my father.

01:03:02.958 --> 01:03:04.041
David...

01:03:05.083 --> 01:03:06.666
By saying such things

01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:08.958
Please don't pull my leg

01:03:10.625 --> 01:03:12.041
You're scaring me.

01:03:14.625 --> 01:03:16.416
I'm not pulling your leg, Janani.

01:03:18.833 --> 01:03:20.500
Joseph Richard Murphy

01:03:22.166 --> 01:03:23.541
...is my father.

01:03:39.166 --> 01:03:43.166
Is this the greater purpose
you were talking about?

01:03:44.666 --> 01:03:47.083
'Every time I spoke to you,'

01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:50.000
I didn't even imagine

01:03:50.416 --> 01:03:53.041
that such a day would come!

01:03:55.125 --> 01:03:58.250
Why was I so comfortable
while talking to you?

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:01.750
Why did I feel so connected to you?

01:04:03.083 --> 01:04:05.041
Why did all of this happen...

01:04:07.833 --> 01:04:09.458
I've got the answer today.

01:04:10.041 --> 01:04:13.916
'Are you speechless ever since
you got to know you're my son?'

01:04:17.583 --> 01:04:18.625
Sorry.

01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:22.416
This is how I am when I'm happy.

01:04:22.625 --> 01:04:25.666
I keep blabbering nonsense

01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:27.333
Janani, you're not my mom.

01:04:33.791 --> 01:04:35.583
You're not my mother, Janani.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.500
Enough with your jokes.

01:04:42.791 --> 01:04:44.000
I know...

01:04:45.416 --> 01:04:47.375
I didn't speak to you
for three days, so...

01:04:48.666 --> 01:04:50.083
you must be angry.

01:04:50.958 --> 01:04:52.541
'I cannot take it.'

01:04:53.208 --> 01:04:56.541
I'm damn serious, there's no way
I'm not your mother!

01:04:56.583 --> 01:04:59.958
I know this David!
You're goddamn lying!

01:05:04.333 --> 01:05:05.500
Please, David.

01:05:07.416 --> 01:05:09.250
You're lying, isn't it?

01:05:11.625 --> 01:05:12.708
Okay.

01:05:15.083 --> 01:05:16.375
I won't get angry.

01:05:17.458 --> 01:05:18.541
Please

01:05:19.166 --> 01:05:20.250
Tell me

01:05:21.458 --> 01:05:23.041
Her name was Rachel.

01:05:23.791 --> 01:05:24.791
My mother.

01:05:27.583 --> 01:05:29.416
It was not a happy marriage.

01:05:30.875 --> 01:05:32.500
When I was 3 years old,

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.333
she left papa and
me for someone else.

01:05:37.041 --> 01:05:40.958
Papa looked after me so well and made sure
I never felt the absence of a mother.

01:05:42.666 --> 01:05:44.083
All was well.

01:05:44.458 --> 01:05:46.375
Me, papa and Richie.

01:05:47.625 --> 01:05:49.458
On that day, it was
Richie's and my birthday.

01:05:49.958 --> 01:05:52.333
When papa was
returning home with a gift,

01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:56.083
he met with an accident.

01:05:59.666 --> 01:06:00.833
And he's no more!

01:06:03.958 --> 01:06:05.166
He's no more.

01:06:08.375 --> 01:06:09.583
He's no more.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.458
I'm sorry Janani.

01:06:19.583 --> 01:06:20.625
I'm sorry...

01:06:21.625 --> 01:06:22.666
Janani...

01:06:26.041 --> 01:06:27.875
Janani...Janani...

01:06:29.583 --> 01:06:33.833
"Breath..."

01:06:38.541 --> 01:06:42.541
"you tell me now"

01:06:50.916 --> 01:06:56.500
"Oh breath..."

01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:06.083
"Where is your place?"

01:07:15.458 --> 01:07:19.291
"I stood still, crying,"

01:07:19.583 --> 01:07:23.416
"before the sea"

01:07:24.958 --> 01:07:32.916
"I lost the tears
of my eyes"

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.208
"As the sun set"

01:07:39.208 --> 01:07:44.041
"The waves were crashing relentlessly"

01:07:44.208 --> 01:07:49.750
"Oh breath..."

01:07:50.708 --> 01:07:54.833
"you tell me now"

01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:02.750
If they loved each other so much,

01:08:02.833 --> 01:08:06.625
Didn't she express
her feeling to Joe at all, David?

01:08:06.791 --> 01:08:09.583
What would have happened
after they left the college?

01:08:10.041 --> 01:08:14.125
And moreover,
why did he marry Rachel?

01:08:14.250 --> 01:08:18.250
"The heaviness in the heart, like a cloud"

01:08:18.666 --> 01:08:19.708
David!

01:08:19.750 --> 01:08:22.541
"Every drop of melody
is filled with worry."

01:08:22.583 --> 01:08:23.708
David!!!

01:08:23.833 --> 01:08:25.166
What are you upto?

01:08:25.333 --> 01:08:28.208
How many times have I told
you not to enter this room!

01:08:28.250 --> 01:08:29.833
Why did you come here?

01:08:29.958 --> 01:08:33.291
"Like a forsaken boat adrift"

01:08:33.333 --> 01:08:35.166
Why are you
still standing here?

01:08:35.416 --> 01:08:36.541
Go out!

01:08:36.708 --> 01:08:37.750
Get lost!

01:08:42.375 --> 01:08:49.291
"When the door of the heart's
dwelling is unlatched"

01:08:53.041 --> 01:08:58.750
"when the light fades ahead"

01:09:03.833 --> 01:09:07.791
"when the calling voice grows tired"

01:09:08.083 --> 01:09:11.000
"and weeps"

01:09:14.375 --> 01:09:21.458
"the hand that once wiped away tears
is no longer near"

01:09:24.250 --> 01:09:28.625
"as long as I exist"

01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:34.250
"the desire to live"

01:09:34.958 --> 01:09:39.625
"Before I depart"

01:09:40.333 --> 01:09:45.000
"a path that is differ

01:09:45.291 --> 01:09:50.000
"Breath..."

01:09:51.750 --> 01:09:55.875
"you tell me now"

01:10:01.333 --> 01:10:06.291
"Oh breath..."

01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:13.000
"Where is your place?"

01:10:18.083 --> 01:10:22.916
"The heaviness in the heart, like a cloud"

01:10:23.375 --> 01:10:28.041
"Every drop of melody is filled with worry"

01:10:28.541 --> 01:10:32.166
"Standing in the scorching wind"

01:10:33.916 --> 01:10:36.750
"Like a forsaken boat adrift"

01:10:37.250 --> 01:10:41.083
He never confided in me
about this matter.

01:10:46.958 --> 01:10:48.916
I too never asked him.

01:10:53.708 --> 01:10:54.958
Just once.

01:10:57.250 --> 01:10:58.791
Only once,

01:10:59.291 --> 01:11:04.541
had he spoken about it to me,

01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:09.791
today, he'd have been alive.

01:11:11.875 --> 01:11:13.916
He'd have been with us.

01:11:14.708 --> 01:11:18.125
I wish I can go back in time,

01:11:18.916 --> 01:11:21.125
And change everything!

01:11:26.166 --> 01:11:27.583
I miss him a lot!

01:11:28.791 --> 01:11:30.083
I miss him, Richie!

01:12:33.916 --> 01:12:34.958
Hi...

01:12:57.250 --> 01:12:59.416
'Janani...Janani, listen'

01:12:59.916 --> 01:13:01.666
'I have a big surprise for you.'

01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:05.708
'if you listen to that,
I'm sure you'll die out of happiness!'

01:13:06.833 --> 01:13:08.666
'Janani, are you listening?

01:13:11.875 --> 01:13:12.916
Yes...

01:13:13.958 --> 01:13:15.041
I'm listening.

01:13:18.666 --> 01:13:21.875
Your surprise is
already killing me, David,

01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:25.541
Every time I see him,

01:13:27.416 --> 01:13:30.625
the thought that he
won't survive, that is killing me.

01:13:31.916 --> 01:13:33.000
His smile

01:13:35.291 --> 01:13:39.541
His soul that keeps
everyone around him happy,

01:13:41.333 --> 01:13:44.041
A heart that loves everyone.

01:13:44.416 --> 01:13:47.000
I know that it's all short lived now.

01:13:47.125 --> 01:13:48.916
That is killing me!

01:13:51.541 --> 01:13:52.916
Should I be scared...

01:13:55.208 --> 01:13:56.333
Should I cry...

01:13:58.916 --> 01:14:01.958
or should I accept it as
my fate and stay quiet?

01:14:03.708 --> 01:14:06.833
There's a lot of
unexpected rains these days.

01:14:09.041 --> 01:14:10.583
It's the same in my life, too.

01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:13.541
Unexpected incidents
keep occurring.

01:14:14.458 --> 01:14:16.625
Like the accident and you.

01:14:18.208 --> 01:14:19.875
I hadn't thought of this Janani,

01:14:21.125 --> 01:14:22.875
I've got a placement elsewhere.

01:14:24.541 --> 01:14:26.083
I'm going to miss this place.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.625
Feels rather heavy, Janani.

01:14:33.625 --> 01:14:36.000
All these days, I wondered
why I didn't get a job there.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.125
But today...

01:14:39.791 --> 01:14:41.666
I don't feel like
leaving all of this behind.

01:14:42.833 --> 01:14:44.666
Maybe, because of you.

01:14:46.833 --> 01:14:49.416
'The fear that I will lose everything'

01:14:50.041 --> 01:14:54.291
'But, now that I know
I will lose it for sure...'

01:14:55.208 --> 01:14:56.791
'That is killing me.'

01:15:00.416 --> 01:15:01.708
Why...?

01:15:04.583 --> 01:15:07.041
Why, David?

01:15:08.375 --> 01:15:09.708
Why...?

01:15:15.375 --> 01:15:16.583
'All this...'

01:15:16.875 --> 01:15:18.000
'It's killing me'

01:15:21.291 --> 01:15:22.333
Sorry

01:15:22.791 --> 01:15:24.750
I got carried away
by my emotions.

01:15:28.666 --> 01:15:30.625
It's okay if I am not with him,

01:15:32.416 --> 01:15:34.708
We must ensure that he's safe.

01:15:37.916 --> 01:15:39.083
'David...'

01:15:40.041 --> 01:15:42.333
Please help me, David.

01:15:46.666 --> 01:15:50.583
I just need one...
one ray of hope!

01:15:54.083 --> 01:15:55.875
'I have decided, David'

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.416
'if he's not there, I'll live
in the orphanage I grew up in.'

01:16:01.916 --> 01:16:04.791
- 'I'll live all my life in his memories.'
-Janani.

01:16:05.708 --> 01:16:06.791
Listen.

01:16:07.375 --> 01:16:08.791
There is a solution for this.

01:16:10.791 --> 01:16:13.500
'Have you ever heard
of the Domino Effect?'

01:16:15.916 --> 01:16:16.916
What does it mean?

01:16:16.958 --> 01:16:19.000
Like a small incident.

01:16:19.958 --> 01:16:21.166
A very small move.

01:16:21.541 --> 01:16:24.583
Can prevent an incident
beyond your wildest imagination.

01:16:25.166 --> 01:16:27.333
If I have to elaborate this theory,

01:16:27.416 --> 01:16:31.208
Just imagine,
playing cards are all lined up,

01:16:31.833 --> 01:16:34.125
And if we slightly push the first card,

01:16:34.416 --> 01:16:36.750
all the cards will fall in a row.

01:16:36.833 --> 01:16:38.208
One after the other.

01:16:38.708 --> 01:16:42.791
But if we keep aside
three cards in the same row?

01:16:43.375 --> 01:16:45.916
It will stop falling.

01:16:46.291 --> 01:16:47.375
Exactly!

01:16:47.875 --> 01:16:49.416
Now, this is Domino Effect.

01:16:50.583 --> 01:16:51.666
And

01:16:52.250 --> 01:16:53.666
to prevent Joe from dying,

01:16:54.041 --> 01:16:55.541
we must use this theory.

01:16:56.083 --> 01:16:57.750
And only you can do it, Janani.

01:16:57.833 --> 01:16:58.833
David...

01:17:01.291 --> 01:17:03.041
How is it even possible?

01:17:04.291 --> 01:17:05.625
- Besides...
- Janani...

01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:07.041
How can I?

01:17:08.291 --> 01:17:09.333
Okay

01:17:09.375 --> 01:17:10.875
Let me explain this to you.

01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:14.500
You said Joe met with an accident
soon after he exited the college.

01:17:14.625 --> 01:17:16.125
Do you know how it happened?

01:17:17.416 --> 01:17:19.791
He was exiting the gate of the college,

01:17:20.166 --> 01:17:23.541
on his scooter, when a car hit him.

01:17:24.333 --> 01:17:25.666
Janani, just imagine,

01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:27.541
why did the car driver come there?

01:17:27.875 --> 01:17:31.458
Let's insert a small reason
why the accident occurred.

01:17:31.916 --> 01:17:33.625
Janani, just imagine.

01:17:35.125 --> 01:17:39.708
At the farewell party, as he is getting
pictures taken with the staff and students,

01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:41.541
Joe searches for you.

01:17:41.958 --> 01:17:48.500
After clicking pictures, he waits for you,
but you don't show up, so he leaves.

01:17:51.041 --> 01:17:54.166
Janani, instead of
hiding behind the pillar,

01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:59.083
had you gone and stood
beside him while clicking pictures,

01:17:59.416 --> 01:18:03.250
He'd not have spent time searching for you
and would've left the college early.

01:18:03.833 --> 01:18:05.416
Did you understand, Janani?

01:18:07.458 --> 01:18:08.833
Just your one move,

01:18:09.125 --> 01:18:10.583
as mentioned by you that day,

01:18:10.708 --> 01:18:12.666
could have prevented Joe's accident.

01:18:13.333 --> 01:18:15.291
Similarly, if you are with him,

01:18:15.958 --> 01:18:18.125
you can prevent the accident
that will happen in future,

01:18:18.458 --> 01:18:20.541
and avoid his death, isn't it Janani?

01:18:21.416 --> 01:18:22.541
Yes

01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:24.791
He will not die.

01:18:27.125 --> 01:18:28.375
Exactly!

01:18:29.375 --> 01:18:32.333
You can stop all the mishaps
from happening to him.

01:18:33.583 --> 01:18:34.833
Yes, David.

01:18:35.625 --> 01:18:38.708
Then he will have a happy and

01:18:39.541 --> 01:18:41.083
beautiful life.

01:18:42.625 --> 01:18:43.708
Yes.

01:18:46.875 --> 01:18:48.916
That's why, he must be with you.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.666
You must propose to him.

01:18:51.833 --> 01:18:53.333
You must marry him.

01:18:53.583 --> 01:18:55.666
And you should stay with him forever.

01:18:58.500 --> 01:18:59.666
Forever...

01:19:00.958 --> 01:19:02.041
Forever!

01:19:02.916 --> 01:19:05.166
Yes! Forever.

01:19:13.125 --> 01:19:14.166
Janani...

01:19:14.666 --> 01:19:15.916
Why are you quiet?

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.333
I've made a huge mistake, David.

01:19:21.125 --> 01:19:22.291
I'm a mess!

01:19:25.708 --> 01:19:27.375
What are you trying to say, Janani?

01:19:29.250 --> 01:19:30.875
Joe met me in the morning.

01:19:31.750 --> 01:19:33.958
It seemed like
he wanted to say something.

01:19:38.541 --> 01:19:41.083
I'm leaving, Janani.
Going to Hyderabad.

01:19:42.125 --> 01:19:43.916
I don't know when I'll be back.

01:19:44.750 --> 01:19:46.458
Is there anything
you want to say?

01:19:47.250 --> 01:19:48.583
About us...

01:19:55.833 --> 01:19:56.833
Janani...

01:19:57.583 --> 01:20:00.250
I'll be taking the last ferry
at 5:30 pm today.

01:20:01.208 --> 01:20:02.625
I'll see you there.

01:20:07.750 --> 01:20:08.791
Joe...

01:20:10.791 --> 01:20:11.833
Janani!

01:20:17.166 --> 01:20:18.333
Jacket.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.333
I'll be waiting, Jenny...

01:20:34.583 --> 01:20:35.666
Jenny!

01:20:37.041 --> 01:20:38.333
You will come, right?

01:20:42.458 --> 01:20:43.541
But

01:20:43.583 --> 01:20:45.291
I just didn't realise it.

01:20:46.166 --> 01:20:48.333
Pained by the thought of losing him,

01:20:49.541 --> 01:20:51.833
I didn't even realise
what he was saying.

01:20:53.875 --> 01:20:55.916
He was next to me, David!

01:20:57.041 --> 01:20:58.416
I'm such a fool!

01:20:58.666 --> 01:21:00.666
Janani, all is not lost!

01:21:00.750 --> 01:21:02.041
You still have time.

01:21:02.333 --> 01:21:03.625
You just go to him.

01:21:05.125 --> 01:21:06.333
No, David.

01:21:07.291 --> 01:21:08.375
No.

01:21:10.708 --> 01:21:12.125
How can I go?

01:21:13.041 --> 01:21:15.500
The way I treated him this morning,

01:21:16.541 --> 01:21:17.583
he...

01:21:18.625 --> 01:21:19.958
what if he rejects me?

01:21:21.666 --> 01:21:24.083
'Janani, you have no idea
how much he loves you!'

01:21:24.708 --> 01:21:28.458
'I've read so many letters that
he wrote and couldn't give you!'

01:21:28.583 --> 01:21:29.875
It was all you.

01:21:30.708 --> 01:21:32.583
It was you everywhere!

01:21:32.916 --> 01:21:35.458
you were the only one in his heart!

01:21:37.583 --> 01:21:38.916
He was madly in...

01:21:40.333 --> 01:21:42.500
He's madly in love with you, Janani!

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.583
So Janani, there is a hope.

01:21:48.666 --> 01:21:50.250
And you are that hope, Janani.

01:21:50.833 --> 01:21:53.750
Go right now and confess
your love to Joe, Janani!

01:21:54.083 --> 01:21:55.291
Please go, Janani!

01:21:56.625 --> 01:21:57.875
Janani, please go.

01:21:59.416 --> 01:22:00.458
Please...

01:23:52.375 --> 01:23:54.541
Joe!!!

01:24:52.250 --> 01:24:53.458
'Jenny...!'

01:24:54.750 --> 01:24:57.750
"Oh cloud"

01:24:58.833 --> 01:25:02.666
"to come together as rain"

01:25:04.791 --> 01:25:07.708
"You"

01:25:09.666 --> 01:25:14.750
"For me, for me, for me alone..."

01:25:16.291 --> 01:25:18.416
"You"

01:25:20.666 --> 01:25:24.375
"Oh, Janani..."

01:25:24.791 --> 01:25:28.833
"You are my boon"

01:25:32.583 --> 01:25:35.750
"You are my love"

01:26:27.916 --> 01:26:32.583
"As the rain descends gently"

01:26:33.833 --> 01:26:38.625
"My heart descends with it"

01:26:39.416 --> 01:26:42.416
"It melts..."

01:26:45.375 --> 01:26:48.208
"It melts..."

01:26:51.333 --> 01:26:54.125
"The sky has melted"

01:26:54.166 --> 01:26:56.416
"it has melted"

01:26:57.208 --> 01:27:01.875
"A tender bud has blossomed"

01:27:03.166 --> 01:27:09.000
"To touch the shores where sky meets sea"

01:27:09.083 --> 01:27:14.916
"Come, let us ascend the bridge of breath"

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:20.833
"To pen the poetry of these droplets"

01:27:20.958 --> 01:27:26.791
"The language of longing stands shy"

01:27:27.458 --> 01:27:32.125
"As the rain descends gently"

01:27:33.416 --> 01:27:38.500
"My heart descends with it"

01:28:57.416 --> 01:28:58.666
Good morning, papa.

01:29:13.208 --> 01:29:14.250
Here's your coffee.

01:29:16.750 --> 01:29:17.958
Breakfast is ready

01:29:18.916 --> 01:29:20.291
I have to go to work.

01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:22.375
No need, stay back for a while.

01:29:24.458 --> 01:29:26.583
Please keep some extra breakfast.

01:29:27.125 --> 01:29:28.791
The prospective bride's
family is visiting us.

01:29:28.833 --> 01:29:33.208
It's best we find you a bride before you
roam the streets with another girl.

01:29:36.041 --> 01:29:37.250
(Doorbell rings)

01:29:38.500 --> 01:29:39.666
Excuse me, papa.

01:29:43.541 --> 01:29:44.625
Yes, coming.

01:29:54.166 --> 01:29:59.583
"To regain the time that slipped away"

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.083
"need no world's embrace"

01:30:03.166 --> 01:30:05.958
"but yours alone"

01:30:06.041 --> 01:30:11.333
"A hand stretched forth
to touch the sky's glowing lamp"

01:30:12.125 --> 01:30:17.666
"and the heavens bent to reach this hand"

01:30:18.083 --> 01:30:23.958
"To touch the shores where sky meets sea"

01:30:24.083 --> 01:30:29.666
"Come, let us ascend
the bridge of breath"

01:30:30.041 --> 01:30:35.791
"To pen the poetry of these droplets"

01:30:35.875 --> 01:30:41.625
"The language of longing stands shy"

01:30:42.416 --> 01:30:47.000
"Oh cloud, to come together as rain..."

01:30:48.625 --> 01:30:51.583
Joe, you should be
hugging her, not me!

01:30:53.041 --> 01:30:54.250
And listen.

01:30:55.416 --> 01:31:01.500
Because I made you a lecturer,
you found such a nice girl.

01:31:01.791 --> 01:31:04.583
So Richard Murphy

01:31:04.875 --> 01:31:06.083
is always right!

01:31:07.083 --> 01:31:08.375
Mark that.

01:31:25.291 --> 01:31:28.208
You should have seen Joe!
He was surprised!

01:31:29.083 --> 01:31:30.125
Jenny!

01:31:31.875 --> 01:31:32.875
Joe!

01:31:33.875 --> 01:31:35.500
What are you doing here?

01:31:36.250 --> 01:31:39.375
Richard Murphy asked me to hug you.

01:31:40.375 --> 01:31:41.375
Oh really?

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:43.500
What else did he tell you?

01:31:43.583 --> 01:31:46.291
He didn't but I'm saying,

01:31:47.166 --> 01:31:48.250
I love you!

01:31:52.125 --> 01:31:53.583
Will you marry me?

01:32:23.541 --> 01:32:24.666
David.

01:32:25.291 --> 01:32:26.375
Who am I?

01:32:27.083 --> 01:32:29.208
And for my sake, you...

01:32:31.125 --> 01:32:33.375
I am not finding the words
to express my happiness!

01:32:33.875 --> 01:32:36.583
when the life
I dreamt of is in front of me

01:32:36.625 --> 01:32:41.125
I don't even know
if it is real or an illusion.

01:32:43.333 --> 01:32:48.791
like the words of a wonderful poem
is dancing on the empty canvas,

01:32:48.833 --> 01:32:50.750
My heart is dancing with joy!

01:32:53.666 --> 01:32:55.666
My life looks complete now.

01:32:58.041 --> 01:33:00.666
'And the reason for all this is you, David'

01:33:00.750 --> 01:33:01.833
'Not me.'

01:33:02.958 --> 01:33:06.708
I've never seen him this happy.

01:33:08.166 --> 01:33:11.791
Every time he smiled.
his smile was incomplete.

01:33:12.625 --> 01:33:13.833
But today...

01:33:14.625 --> 01:33:17.166
'I could see his smile reaching his eyes!'

01:33:20.208 --> 01:33:21.500
'Thank you, David.'

01:33:21.708 --> 01:33:23.000
You're the best!

01:33:24.208 --> 01:33:25.666
Thank you so much.

01:33:30.083 --> 01:33:32.000
- Janani.
- Hmm...!

01:33:32.458 --> 01:33:34.583
I only have one memory with papa...

01:33:37.416 --> 01:33:39.500
Of playing with him at the beach.

01:33:40.708 --> 01:33:42.375
Even that memory has faded

01:33:46.250 --> 01:33:48.916
Like somebody is calling me from far...

01:33:51.750 --> 01:33:54.458
A feeling like I'm drowning in water...

01:33:55.541 --> 01:33:58.750
And just as I am drowning,
papa runs to me and reaches out to my hand

01:34:01.541 --> 01:34:03.375
And by the time he holds it,

01:34:06.583 --> 01:34:07.708
'I wake up.'

01:34:10.500 --> 01:34:13.166
Every time, even in my dreams,
I lose him Janani.

01:34:17.291 --> 01:34:20.541
You say he's really happy today.

01:34:22.375 --> 01:34:24.750
But I'm not lucky enough to see it.

01:34:26.375 --> 01:34:27.416
Janani...

01:34:30.875 --> 01:34:32.208
If you don't mind,

01:34:33.708 --> 01:34:35.000
just once,

01:34:40.166 --> 01:34:42.875
only once can I listen to his voice?

01:34:44.041 --> 01:34:45.041
Please...

01:34:47.416 --> 01:34:48.416
Please?

01:34:50.833 --> 01:34:51.875
David.

01:34:53.875 --> 01:34:55.375
Just give me a minute.

01:35:09.333 --> 01:35:10.750
One moment, please.

01:35:11.250 --> 01:35:14.333
Janani, what are upto?
I'm not supposed to be coming here.

01:35:23.875 --> 01:35:26.083
David. David.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.125
David again.

01:35:28.791 --> 01:35:32.000
'So many posters by the name David?'

01:35:32.125 --> 01:35:33.833
'Interesting. Jenny...'

01:35:34.333 --> 01:35:35.541
Who is this, David?

01:35:37.041 --> 01:35:42.583
It looks like some 'David' is getting
more importance than me!

01:35:43.166 --> 01:35:45.458
'Do I need to be worried about him?'

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.708
'I like the name David.'

01:35:50.333 --> 01:35:51.416
So much?

01:35:52.625 --> 01:35:54.333
Yes, you can say that.

01:35:55.125 --> 01:35:58.791
You too will like the name
since you're with me.

01:36:00.958 --> 01:36:02.500
Do I have any option?

01:36:03.625 --> 01:36:04.833
'I will like it.'

01:36:13.041 --> 01:36:14.041
'Jenny'

01:36:15.208 --> 01:36:16.541
'Had you not been there,'

01:36:18.416 --> 01:36:20.583
I can't even imagine my life.

01:36:22.625 --> 01:36:25.750
I didn't imagine that papa would
accept you so easily!

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.500
I just realised one thing.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:30.500
'That he loves me a lot.

01:36:32.333 --> 01:36:34.541
I had never asked him
for anything in life.

01:36:35.583 --> 01:36:36.750
The mistake is mine.

01:36:37.458 --> 01:36:40.875
Before I even asked,
he'd have everything ready for me.

01:36:41.791 --> 01:36:42.833
'For me'

01:36:42.916 --> 01:36:44.583
'he's always been a hero.'

01:36:48.958 --> 01:36:52.500
And on how a good father should be,
he has set the best example.

01:36:57.083 --> 01:36:58.333
Janani, trust me.

01:36:58.833 --> 01:37:02.333
The love and friendship
I will give to our little one,

01:37:03.416 --> 01:37:06.416
'and more than all, the faith.'

01:37:06.750 --> 01:37:08.958
'That I have got his back.'

01:37:13.041 --> 01:37:15.416
'Jenny, my kids are going to
love me more than you!'

01:37:15.541 --> 01:37:17.416
'And I'm already in love with them!'

01:37:25.375 --> 01:37:26.708
I love you so much.

01:37:26.750 --> 01:37:28.375
For making this happen.

01:37:52.833 --> 01:37:54.208
I heard that.

01:37:58.666 --> 01:37:59.833
Hello

01:38:00.375 --> 01:38:02.291
That was him, isn't it?

01:38:47.250 --> 01:38:49.000
I heard him.

01:38:51.208 --> 01:38:52.958
I heard him.

01:38:54.375 --> 01:38:55.875
It was him, right?

01:39:01.625 --> 01:39:02.666
Sorry, Richie.

01:39:04.583 --> 01:39:07.750
I wanted to surprise you
on your birthday.

01:39:10.500 --> 01:39:13.416
but I never thought that
the surprise would be like this.

01:39:17.333 --> 01:39:19.208
I didn't believe it at first.

01:39:20.958 --> 01:39:25.125
Me being in 2024 is as
true as you being in 1996.

01:39:26.541 --> 01:39:28.666
'The roaring whispers'

01:39:29.708 --> 01:39:32.666
Beaming into a smile,
fighting the blush.

01:39:37.666 --> 01:39:39.041
Who is this David?

01:39:41.291 --> 01:39:42.416
Grandpa...

01:39:48.958 --> 01:39:51.250
Why did you hide all this from me?

01:39:54.041 --> 01:39:56.833
Fear grandpa...Fear...

01:39:58.125 --> 01:40:00.583
That you might shout at me
if you get to know.

01:40:00.666 --> 01:40:01.916
I was scared.

01:40:04.916 --> 01:40:05.791
Sorry.

01:40:05.833 --> 01:40:09.291
Sorry. He is sorry apparently!

01:40:10.583 --> 01:40:12.750
Does as he pleases and says sorry!

01:40:17.166 --> 01:40:20.208
If I'm alive till date,

01:40:23.875 --> 01:40:28.000
it's because I see him in you.

01:40:30.958 --> 01:40:32.500
Yes, I get angry.

01:40:33.250 --> 01:40:34.291
I'm elder.

01:40:35.875 --> 01:40:36.958
I will scold you

01:40:37.333 --> 01:40:38.333
I hit you

01:40:38.916 --> 01:40:41.291
I stop talking
when I'm angry with you.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:47.375
But have I ever loved you any less?

01:40:50.875 --> 01:40:53.666
I don't know what fear he had for me,

01:40:55.125 --> 01:40:57.500
He would never share
anything with me.

01:41:00.125 --> 01:41:02.750
And now, you too...

01:41:05.625 --> 01:41:08.500
I could never tell him this.

01:41:09.666 --> 01:41:11.375
Now, I can't even tell him.

01:41:13.958 --> 01:41:15.208
But please

01:41:17.958 --> 01:41:23.166
Forgive me
if I've done anything wrong.

01:41:26.583 --> 01:41:29.875
But never hide anything
from me from now on.

01:41:31.083 --> 01:41:32.083
Never.

01:41:33.416 --> 01:41:36.291
Who else do I have, except you?

01:41:42.833 --> 01:41:45.500
Will Joe really come back?

01:41:45.833 --> 01:41:46.875
Yes, grandpa.

01:41:47.583 --> 01:41:48.916
He's going to come back.

01:41:55.625 --> 01:41:57.708
He is coming back!

01:41:59.666 --> 01:42:03.166
Richie, happy birthday to you!

01:42:06.500 --> 01:42:09.500
Happy birthday to you too!

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:39.666

01:46:40.083 --> 01:46:42.666
'A surprise or Joy?'

01:46:43.875 --> 01:46:46.416
'aeon of riddles
is about to reveal.'

01:46:47.791 --> 01:46:49.125
'What would I get?'

01:46:50.583 --> 01:46:51.625
'Answers?'

01:46:52.666 --> 01:46:53.750
'Or questions?'

01:46:57.500 --> 01:46:59.208
'I have no time to think'

01:46:59.958 --> 01:47:01.541
'The guest is here'

01:47:02.125 --> 01:47:03.583
'Very close'

01:47:04.666 --> 01:47:06.250
'but yet a Stranger'

01:47:08.916 --> 01:47:10.375
'but yet a stranger!'

01:48:26.750 --> 01:48:27.750
Jenny.

01:48:28.375 --> 01:48:29.541
You know what?

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.416
I just can't wait to start
my life with you.

01:48:33.250 --> 01:48:34.625
My family with you.

01:48:36.250 --> 01:48:38.125
You seem to have thought far ahead.

01:48:38.166 --> 01:48:39.208
Of course.

01:48:40.041 --> 01:48:43.416
Remember we spoke
about David in your room?

01:48:47.208 --> 01:48:49.625
since that day, that name
has been lingering in my mind.

01:48:53.208 --> 01:48:55.000
Can we name our son David?

01:49:01.375 --> 01:49:03.041
Somehow from that day,

01:49:03.250 --> 01:49:07.250
I feel he's been around
us like a cute cupid!

01:49:07.791 --> 01:49:12.750
And he's trying really
hard to bring us together.

01:49:15.375 --> 01:49:17.416
I'm just looking forward
to this, Jenny.

01:49:21.250 --> 01:49:22.416
Yes.

01:49:31.291 --> 01:49:32.708
You've come alone?

01:49:34.916 --> 01:49:35.958
Richie?

01:49:38.125 --> 01:49:39.250
He's out.

01:49:43.750 --> 01:49:45.041
Sorry.

01:49:48.916 --> 01:49:51.166
He says he can't bear
to see you like this.

01:49:52.791 --> 01:49:53.833
Jessie...

01:49:55.708 --> 01:49:57.333
In case I die,

01:49:57.833 --> 01:49:59.833
what will you
wear to the funeral?

01:50:00.625 --> 01:50:02.750
Gown or a frock?

01:50:05.458 --> 01:50:07.541
- What nonsense are you talking?
- Gown.

01:50:08.583 --> 01:50:10.958
Wear a gown,
you'll look good.

01:50:17.416 --> 01:50:18.833
You'll look good.

01:50:20.083 --> 01:50:21.375
You know what?

01:50:22.791 --> 01:50:27.958
Actually, you're the most...
most beautiful woman in the world!

01:50:29.250 --> 01:50:31.125
Especially when you're decked up.

01:50:38.041 --> 01:50:39.708
'Jessie, can you come closer?'

01:51:14.458 --> 01:51:17.166
What happened, Jessie?

01:51:17.291 --> 01:51:19.041
Jessie, please don't cry.

01:51:19.875 --> 01:51:21.416
He acts like that sometimes,

01:51:21.791 --> 01:51:23.291
Don't you know that?

01:51:24.083 --> 01:51:27.958
Only thing he had
in his mind was that radio!

01:51:28.666 --> 01:51:29.958
now, this has happened.

01:51:30.958 --> 01:51:33.041
Why did he have to bother
about such things?

01:51:34.375 --> 01:51:37.666
He wants to change a story
that happened 20 years ago!

01:51:37.791 --> 01:51:38.958
Is he mad?

01:51:39.958 --> 01:51:43.125
Does he want to get them married
and then play with their kids?

01:51:44.500 --> 01:51:46.791
First of all, if they get married,
how will this guy...

01:51:48.666 --> 01:51:50.166
'How will this guy be born?'

01:51:54.750 --> 01:51:55.875
'Janani...'

01:51:56.166 --> 01:51:58.041
'Finally, it's the day for you, man!'

01:51:58.500 --> 01:52:00.333
'I'm so happy for you both.'

01:52:00.625 --> 01:52:02.958
'Richie proudly declared last night,'

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:06.000
that his daughter-in-law is
a strong and determined girl.

01:52:06.125 --> 01:52:08.166
'As though he found
you for Joe!'

01:52:08.250 --> 01:52:09.958
'I'm so happy for my boy!'

01:52:12.333 --> 01:52:14.375
Had Richie himself
found a bride for Joe,

01:52:15.208 --> 01:52:17.041
he'd not have been
able to find a girl like you.

01:52:17.083 --> 01:52:18.916
That's for sure, Janani.

01:52:20.208 --> 01:52:22.208
Tony...thank you!

01:52:22.625 --> 01:52:23.875
Leave that aside.

01:52:24.500 --> 01:52:27.583
I heard that in the future,
a name for a baby boy has been decided.

01:52:28.666 --> 01:52:30.208
Joe was talking about it.

01:52:30.250 --> 01:52:31.375
What is that?

01:52:32.791 --> 01:52:33.791
David.

01:52:33.875 --> 01:52:35.500
Yes! David.

01:52:36.708 --> 01:52:38.833
'David Joseph Murphy'

01:52:40.500 --> 01:52:42.750
So you knew everything all along.

01:52:42.791 --> 01:52:43.875
Right?

01:52:45.125 --> 01:52:47.791
Yes. Do you think
I'm a fool like you, Jessie!

01:52:47.833 --> 01:52:49.125
But why David?

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:51.000
Joe.

01:52:53.166 --> 01:52:54.208
Please!

01:52:55.166 --> 01:52:57.500
They won't even know the sacrifice
you're about to make!

01:52:57.583 --> 01:52:59.208
Stop this right now!

01:53:01.541 --> 01:53:02.583
'Jessie...'

01:53:03.333 --> 01:53:05.166
'What's your dad's salary?'

01:53:08.625 --> 01:53:10.583
'Do you know your college fee?'

01:53:12.416 --> 01:53:16.208
'Add to this your daily
expenses, funds for the future'

01:53:16.250 --> 01:53:19.041
'your marriage expense.
All this has to be kept'

01:53:21.291 --> 01:53:23.666
Tell me what are they left
with in the end after all this?

01:53:24.833 --> 01:53:30.583
'Yet, till the end, all they want is
their daughter's happiness.'

01:53:31.666 --> 01:53:33.458
'How selfless they are!'

01:53:35.583 --> 01:53:37.541
All parents are like that, Jessie.

01:53:38.291 --> 01:53:41.958
They make sacrifices,
but never think twice about it.

01:53:44.166 --> 01:53:46.083
When they don't think twice,

01:53:47.208 --> 01:53:49.541
why should we give it
a second thought, Jessie?

01:53:49.875 --> 01:53:52.500
Do you know the consequences
of what you're going to do?

01:54:01.708 --> 01:54:03.958
I will be completely
wiped out of everyone's memory.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
'Actually, I'm not bad at physics.'

01:54:06.041 --> 01:54:07.083
Isn't it?

01:54:07.125 --> 01:54:08.250
Shut up!

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:10.875
I have an old, conked radio at home.

01:54:10.916 --> 01:54:12.875
Why doesn't that radio
talk to me like yours?

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:16.291
Shall I give you that manual?

01:54:16.333 --> 01:54:17.666
Which one?

01:54:18.041 --> 01:54:19.208
Lays Charles.

01:54:19.291 --> 01:54:20.916
He's Loose Charles.

01:54:20.958 --> 01:54:23.250
What you're doing and for whom?

01:54:24.291 --> 01:54:27.750
if I don't understand all this,
then who will?

01:54:40.875 --> 01:54:43.375
Even I have known
the pain of losing a father.

01:54:43.416 --> 01:54:45.125
I know what it feels like!

01:54:46.958 --> 01:54:48.625
Whenever I missed him,

01:54:48.666 --> 01:54:50.625
I'd take strength from the fact,

01:54:50.666 --> 01:54:52.291
that I have you.

01:54:53.625 --> 01:54:55.791
What will I do without you!

01:54:55.833 --> 01:54:57.833
What's this drama, dude!

01:54:57.916 --> 01:54:59.416
I'm going now...

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.291
So I'll convey
it to your dad.

01:55:04.333 --> 01:55:05.541
My father...

01:55:05.583 --> 01:55:07.833
would have already
found someone there by now.

01:55:07.875 --> 01:55:08.916
Shut up.

01:55:09.291 --> 01:55:11.416
Is he also like you?

01:55:12.791 --> 01:55:14.291
He's not like me.

01:55:14.375 --> 01:55:15.791
I'm exactly like him.

01:55:16.250 --> 01:55:18.916
You're like no one.
You're like a security guard!

01:58:46.541 --> 01:58:48.000
I'm asking you again, Richie.

01:58:48.250 --> 01:58:49.666
Where is the radio, tell me!

01:58:49.958 --> 01:58:52.416
If I'm alive, it means the wedding
hasn't taken place there!

01:58:53.875 --> 01:58:55.416
Richie say something, please!

01:58:55.708 --> 01:58:57.208
What do you
want me to say?

01:58:58.416 --> 01:59:00.458
I'm least bothered about
what's happened there.

01:59:04.541 --> 01:59:08.000
You're there with me today
and that's enough for me.

01:59:09.166 --> 01:59:11.750
Nobody will mention
that radio again.

01:59:13.250 --> 01:59:14.541
That is final.

01:59:16.041 --> 01:59:17.208
Shucks!

01:59:25.625 --> 01:59:27.041
I failed miserably, Jessie.

01:59:28.458 --> 01:59:30.125
They should've got married.

01:59:33.125 --> 01:59:34.166
Yes.

01:59:34.583 --> 01:59:36.458
They should have got married.

01:59:38.375 --> 01:59:40.083
But had they done so,

01:59:41.041 --> 01:59:42.541
David wouldn't have existed.

01:59:44.333 --> 01:59:46.625
And without David,

01:59:48.458 --> 01:59:50.000
there's no Jessie too.

01:59:53.625 --> 01:59:55.791
I had decided
in the hospital itself.

01:59:57.500 --> 01:59:58.875
If you're not in my life,

01:59:58.958 --> 02:00:01.583
I'll do service
at some orphanage,

02:00:02.750 --> 02:00:05.333
and dedicate my life
to your memory.

02:00:08.083 --> 02:00:09.291
Because,

02:00:13.083 --> 02:00:15.083
I'm the happiest only
around you, David.

02:00:17.375 --> 02:00:20.916
'If he isn't in my life, I'll live the rest of
my life in the orphanage I grew up in.'

02:00:22.291 --> 02:00:25.250
'I'll live the rest of
my life in his memory.'

02:00:25.708 --> 02:00:26.916
Jessie.

02:00:27.083 --> 02:00:30.083
Will you really join
an orphanage, if I'm not there?

02:00:31.583 --> 02:00:33.541
Loving you makes me
feel complete, David.

02:00:33.666 --> 02:00:35.541
I don't want anything
if you're not there!

02:00:38.291 --> 02:00:39.750
- How could I miss this!
- Huh?

02:00:43.333 --> 02:00:44.791
How could I miss this!

02:00:50.041 --> 02:00:51.791
Jessie, you know what?

02:00:52.458 --> 02:00:54.875
Your love makes me the best.

02:00:56.916 --> 02:00:59.000
Neither can I imagine
my life without you.

02:00:59.083 --> 02:01:01.875
I'll bring back all
the joys we've lost.

02:01:03.083 --> 02:01:04.500
Just give me some time.

02:01:07.833 --> 02:01:09.000
'The path is old'

02:01:09.416 --> 02:01:10.958
'But the step is new'

02:01:11.166 --> 02:01:13.333
'The horizon is about
to touch my hands'

02:01:14.125 --> 02:01:16.416
'While the dream has just manifested'

02:01:16.916 --> 02:01:18.375
'The wind is old'

02:01:18.500 --> 02:01:19.958
'The fragrance is new'

02:01:20.250 --> 02:01:22.541
'Every noise is harmonious now,'

02:01:22.791 --> 02:01:25.041
'Every minute is a aeon now'

02:01:25.458 --> 02:01:26.875
'These words are old'

02:01:27.250 --> 02:01:28.583
'But it feels novel.'

02:01:28.875 --> 02:01:31.041
'And the longing has
crossed its limits'

02:01:31.583 --> 02:01:33.875
'While life somewhere awaits me'

02:01:34.500 --> 02:01:35.791
'The path is old'

02:01:36.166 --> 02:01:37.625
'But the step is new'

02:01:37.958 --> 02:01:40.166
'The horizon is about
to touch my hands'

02:01:40.458 --> 02:01:43.625
'While the dream has
just manifested'

02:02:02.041 --> 02:02:03.166
Sir, Janani...

02:02:03.375 --> 02:02:05.458
- Is there anybody called Janani here?
- No, I don't know.

02:02:05.500 --> 02:02:07.625
- Sir, are you sure?
- There's no one, dude!

02:02:08.375 --> 02:02:12.083
- Janani Chandrashekhar!
- I don't know who that is, go away!

02:02:20.833 --> 02:02:21.958
'Jenny!'

02:02:23.375 --> 02:02:25.666
Jenny! Sir, Jenny.

02:02:25.875 --> 02:02:27.791
Jenny madam, at this hour?

02:02:28.666 --> 02:02:30.333
She already must be
at the bridge by now.

02:02:30.416 --> 02:02:32.458
The Ferry Point bridge, my man!

02:03:39.916 --> 02:03:40.958
Janani...

02:04:47.333 --> 02:04:48.416
Joe...

02:04:49.250 --> 02:04:50.416
David.

02:05:38.875 --> 02:05:41.416
'Janani, why did you do this?'

02:05:41.833 --> 02:05:43.833
'Everything was going well, isn't it?'

02:05:43.916 --> 02:05:45.333
'At the last moment'

02:05:45.791 --> 02:05:46.875
'Why?'

02:05:47.333 --> 02:05:50.000
'Do you know what a fine job
Joe did by selecting you!'

02:05:50.083 --> 02:05:53.416
'Because he's someone who
listens to Richie all the time!'

02:05:53.708 --> 02:05:56.333
If you guys were
not this determined,

02:05:57.750 --> 02:05:59.375
'you would have been in some corner'

02:05:59.458 --> 02:06:00.875
'and Joe in another.'

02:06:01.875 --> 02:06:03.041
And we...

02:06:03.125 --> 02:06:04.791
...would have no dreams in our eyes!

02:06:05.375 --> 02:06:07.416
'Relationships are so strange.'

02:06:07.791 --> 02:06:10.500
'For a David to arrive,
Joe and Janani had to unite!'

02:06:18.833 --> 02:06:21.375
'See, I am so dull in Physics!'

02:06:22.416 --> 02:06:26.083
'It's only when Tony spoke
to me that I realised'

02:06:26.875 --> 02:06:28.625
'that if I marry Joe,'

02:06:29.041 --> 02:06:30.708
'how will you be born?'

02:06:32.041 --> 02:06:34.166
It's ok if I don't get Joe,

02:06:34.916 --> 02:06:36.666
I wanted to save him from death,

02:06:38.416 --> 02:06:40.916
and ensure that you live.

02:06:44.083 --> 02:06:46.541
But I couldn't save
him from dying...

02:06:50.375 --> 02:06:52.916
'The brief time I spent with Joe'

02:06:53.416 --> 02:06:55.708
'is enough for my lifetime.'

02:06:59.083 --> 02:07:00.666
Even today for his sake,

02:07:01.541 --> 02:07:03.666
I come to the spot
where we lost him.

02:07:04.458 --> 02:07:05.666
I don't know...

02:07:06.750 --> 02:07:08.791
I wait for him like a mad person.

02:07:10.083 --> 02:07:12.416
always in the hope that
he'll appear in some form,

02:07:12.916 --> 02:07:15.083
and talk to me!

02:07:16.125 --> 02:07:18.166
'Even though you're
not born to me'

02:07:18.833 --> 02:07:21.416
The son born just for me
had to live

02:07:22.958 --> 02:07:26.708
The wish that I'll
see you, cuddle you

02:07:27.666 --> 02:07:29.666
has finally been fulfilled today.

02:07:32.833 --> 02:07:33.875
See?

02:07:34.666 --> 02:07:36.625
Life does come full circle, right?

02:07:41.500 --> 02:07:43.333
Then why didn't
you come all these days?

02:07:46.916 --> 02:07:48.458
'How would I, David?'

02:07:48.500 --> 02:07:50.125
'I didn't have
the courage to do so!'

02:07:52.083 --> 02:07:56.125
'I was the one who left him
at the altar and insulted him.'

02:07:56.333 --> 02:08:00.583
'Had I come back, how
would he accept me?'

02:08:00.833 --> 02:08:03.875
'And after Tony
spoke to me, I realised'

02:08:04.208 --> 02:08:07.875
'The reason David is born is not
because of Joe and Janani,

02:08:08.875 --> 02:08:10.666
'It was because of Joe and Rachel.'

02:08:11.333 --> 02:08:14.416
'So had I gotten married then,
you wouldn't have been born.'

02:08:15.041 --> 02:08:20.833
'And it would've been impossible
to convince everyone about this matter.'

02:08:26.708 --> 02:08:28.000
Okay, forget all that.

02:08:28.541 --> 02:08:31.458
But I was very confident
about one thing.

02:08:33.416 --> 02:08:34.708
I waited for you.

02:08:36.041 --> 02:08:38.041
To come someday,

02:08:38.875 --> 02:08:40.125
and see me.

02:08:41.625 --> 02:08:43.416
and then,
I'll cuddle you

02:08:44.666 --> 02:08:48.416
And you'll call me "mom."

02:08:49.333 --> 02:08:50.500
That was my wish...

02:08:53.291 --> 02:08:55.416
That hope isn't a lie, right?

02:09:08.333 --> 02:09:09.458
Mom...

02:10:07.208 --> 02:10:08.416
'Janani...'

02:10:10.666 --> 02:10:11.708
'Thank you.'

02:10:13.750 --> 02:10:14.791
'Joe...'

02:10:16.250 --> 02:10:17.500
'I love you.'

02:10:18.083 --> 02:10:20.250
'Murphy'
