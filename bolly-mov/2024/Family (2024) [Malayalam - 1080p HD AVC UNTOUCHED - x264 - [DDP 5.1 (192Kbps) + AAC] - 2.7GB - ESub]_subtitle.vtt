00:51.375 --> 00:52.459
Don't worry.

00:52.959 --> 00:54.626
Leopard won't come this way.

00:56.626 --> 00:57.709
Are you sure?

00:59.459 --> 01:03.000
It won't hurt you unless
it felt threatened.

01:26.876 --> 01:28.709
The movie got over late.

01:28.876 --> 01:30.626
I figured you might have slept.

01:30.667 --> 01:33.792
Roy had told him to get back
as soon as it gets over.

01:34.042 --> 01:35.167
Where is Roy uncle?

01:35.209 --> 01:37.250
He has gone for some meeting.

01:38.209 --> 01:39.792
Have breakfast with us, Sony!

01:39.918 --> 01:41.459
We have already eaten.

01:41.751 --> 01:43.876
Dad will be waiting to go
to the farm.

01:45.209 --> 01:47.125
Sony, Have you got
any poetry books?

01:47.751 --> 01:50.584
He has entered a poetry
recitation at school

01:50.959 --> 01:52.083
When is it?

01:52.125 --> 01:54.709
21st, next Tuesday.

01:55.918 --> 01:57.042
We don't need a book.

01:57.083 --> 01:58.751
I'll come this Saturday
and teach him.

02:04.500 --> 02:05.584
Subin

02:06.542 --> 02:07.959
Sony is leaving.

02:10.751 --> 02:11.918
Subi

02:12.918 --> 02:14.250
See you on Saturday.

02:20.459 --> 02:21.417
Alright.

03:24.959 --> 03:26.542
Heard that you've resumed old habits.

03:26.626 --> 03:27.751
What habits?

03:27.959 --> 03:29.083
Smoking and Drinking.

03:29.292 --> 03:30.542
Who told you all this?

03:30.999 --> 03:34.042
You don't have to convince me.

03:34.918 --> 03:36.083
Then why do you ask?

03:36.125 --> 03:37.417
My questions are the problem now?

03:39.500 --> 03:40.918
Do you talk to Sony nowadays?

03:41.918 --> 03:43.334
Any idea what's in his mind?

03:43.375 --> 03:45.542
When I ask him anything
he turns mute.

03:45.999 --> 03:47.626
That's because he
is afraid of you.

03:47.792 --> 03:49.918
He talks properly to others.

03:50.542 --> 03:52.375
We let him study for a
year as he wanted.

03:54.459 --> 03:57.667
And when I ask him to look for
another job, he doesn't like it.

03:57.918 --> 04:00.125
He used to run
a tuition center,right?

04:00.959 --> 04:02.292
It was of no use.

04:02.334 --> 04:04.834
If it's a salaried job,
he could be at ease.

04:05.542 --> 04:08.000
I'll have a word with
the Vicar General

04:08.500 --> 04:10.334
Give me a couple of months.

04:11.125 --> 04:13.999
I'll figure out something by Easter.

04:15.250 --> 04:16.999
If there is an expense,
we'll take care of it.

04:18.125 --> 04:19.751
They will take it from his salary.

04:19.792 --> 04:21.751
You stop drinking if you can.

04:23.125 --> 04:25.125
Stop making an alcoholic out of me.

04:30.417 --> 04:31.667
Dear Everyone,

04:31.876 --> 04:34.626
Our dear son Ditto,

04:34.959 --> 04:38.375
Is being welcomed by his
rightful brother-in-laws,

04:48.042 --> 04:50.792
Next is the beautification ritual,

04:51.542 --> 04:53.999
For which we invite the barber on stage.

04:56.751 --> 05:01.792
All men above the age of seventeen,

05:02.751 --> 05:04.709
Shall I beautify the groom?

05:05.125 --> 05:06.667
Can't hear you!

05:07.375 --> 05:11.999
All men above the age of seventeen,

05:12.250 --> 05:14.792
Shall I beautify the groom?

05:15.292 --> 05:16.834
Can't hear you!

05:17.999 --> 05:22.250
I'm asking the men above
seventeen years

05:22.918 --> 05:26.250
Shall I beautify the groom, Ditto?

05:26.626 --> 05:28.125
Yes, you may!

07:23.999 --> 07:29.959
"The season has come"

07:30.042 --> 07:34.500
"On your children who roam"

07:34.667 --> 07:38.959
"Protect them keenly"

07:38.999 --> 07:43.209
"With your showers of mercy, St. Thomas"

07:43.250 --> 07:46.959
"Silk and homespun fabrics"

07:46.999 --> 07:49.667
"Pearl necklaces"

07:49.709 --> 07:52.667
"On decorated marquee"

07:52.709 --> 08:00.125
"Come help us, St Thomas"

08:00.209 --> 08:04.500
"On decorated marquee,
come bless us"

08:11.834 --> 08:15.375
"Wood, Stones, Gold, and Silver"

08:15.459 --> 08:18.959
"Copper and Iron, ever filling the mind"

08:18.999 --> 08:24.042
"Works to be done ever and more"

08:28.209 --> 08:32.250
"In pride, the dear
ones would do it"

08:42.042 --> 08:44.959
"In unity, the dears ones
in front of you"

08:44.999 --> 08:47.083
"This way it goes"

10:48.959 --> 10:49.834
What's happening?

10:49.876 --> 10:51.334
It's the old lady's cow.

10:51.876 --> 10:52.709
Where?

10:52.792 --> 10:53.834
In the pit.

11:01.459 --> 11:02.459
Here

11:03.042 --> 11:03.999
Hold

11:04.417 --> 11:05.626
Lift up

11:05.876 --> 11:09.834
Though it's for the leopard,
an elephant can fit in here.

11:12.125 --> 11:13.792
I think that its spine is fractured.

11:14.083 --> 11:15.751
We'll pull it up somehow.

11:19.250 --> 11:21.042
There's a rope at Pilla's house

11:22.125 --> 11:23.792
We'll send someone.

11:24.250 --> 11:26.876
Unni must have some
stuff with him.

11:26.918 --> 11:27.999
I'll try calling him.

12:15.709 --> 12:18.999
Pull it up!

12:21.542 --> 12:23.125
Bring it here!

12:26.209 --> 12:31.042
[Indistinct chatters]

12:31.083 --> 12:33.999
Wait

12:39.167 --> 12:41.042
Okay, let it loose.

12:41.417 --> 12:43.125
Slowly release it now.

13:02.334 --> 13:04.292
[Indistinct chatters]

13:11.375 --> 13:14.667
[Indistinct chatters]

13:29.792 --> 13:32.417
Did you close down your
tuition centre?

13:32.459 --> 13:33.709
Yeah, I did.

13:34.459 --> 13:36.876
Stephy finds maths a bit difficult.

13:37.542 --> 13:40.125
She can manage other subjects.

13:40.500 --> 13:41.792
But math is not easy.

13:42.709 --> 13:44.250
That can be taken care of.

13:45.125 --> 13:49.542
If you can take two classes per week,
it will be good right?

13:50.626 --> 13:52.375
Yeah, they'll be fine.

13:53.626 --> 13:55.125
How much do you charge?

13:55.834 --> 13:58.667
I don't set fees for my acquaintances.

13:58.959 --> 14:00.959
You may set an amount yourself.

14:00.999 --> 14:02.751
Shall we start next week?

14:02.792 --> 14:03.375
Yeah,

14:04.792 --> 14:05.959
I'll come by.

15:54.292 --> 15:55.667
Leave it there, Aunty!

15:56.459 --> 15:57.751
That's alright.

15:58.125 --> 15:59.876
You won't be here every day.

15:59.999 --> 16:01.250
I'll have to do it myself.

16:04.459 --> 16:05.500
Let me do it.

16:07.959 --> 16:09.459
Alright, then you
scoop this up.

16:09.999 --> 16:11.167
I'll make a coffee.

16:56.167 --> 16:57.959
Grandpa, do you feel cold?

16:59.292 --> 17:00.417
As usual.

17:01.999 --> 17:04.375
Saji uncle buys alcohol for
you, doesn't he?

17:06.876 --> 17:08.292
Right!

17:10.751 --> 17:18.125
Ask your father to bring some of his
home-brewed arrack.

17:18.167 --> 17:19.959
As if that's so necessary now!

17:20.876 --> 17:23.500
His Cholesterol and Uric acid
levels are high, already.

17:53.959 --> 17:55.792
I'm not allowed to drink
Coffee either.

17:56.999 --> 17:58.792
How can one live without
anything at all?

18:01.500 --> 18:03.375
After a certain age,

18:04.500 --> 18:06.999
This level of caution
is unnecessary.

18:08.751 --> 18:12.999
Without eating or drinking
to one's content,

18:14.834 --> 18:16.959
What is the use of
living a long life?

18:22.792 --> 18:25.042
Kurian brought a bottle for me.

18:25.999 --> 18:27.792
She has hidden it somewhere.

18:28.959 --> 18:30.292
Easter is around the corner,

18:30.834 --> 18:33.999
Drinking too much is not good
for your kidney or liver.

18:34.751 --> 18:36.918
Hospital bills will cost a lot.

18:38.417 --> 18:39.709
That's also true.

18:40.375 --> 18:41.834
I have become old.

18:43.292 --> 18:47.999
It is pointless to spend
money on me now.

18:49.375 --> 18:54.209
Those who love you would like to
see you around for a little longer.

18:57.459 --> 18:59.334
How innocent does he act with you!

18:59.751 --> 19:01.709
Sometimes he's entirely different.

19:02.209 --> 19:03.709
Gets too adamant.

19:05.083 --> 19:06.999
The eldest son has got
the same genes.

19:07.667 --> 19:09.542
As soon as I get out of sight,

19:09.626 --> 19:11.375
He starts yelling 'Rani...Rani'.

19:12.834 --> 19:14.375
Sometimes I feel bad for him.

19:14.792 --> 19:16.125
He's like a child.

19:17.334 --> 19:20.334
Who knows what we would
turn into as age hits us?

19:21.500 --> 19:24.417
Your mother-in-law used to
be even more intense.

19:24.876 --> 19:26.626
Jaya has told me about her.

19:27.250 --> 19:29.334
Luckily she died before I came.

19:30.834 --> 19:33.500
Look, I'm just blabbering away.

19:33.542 --> 19:34.500
I know.

19:35.999 --> 19:38.959
Papa doesn't bad mouth, at least!

19:40.250 --> 19:41.999
His face reflects what's
in his mind.

19:44.167 --> 19:45.792
Not really!

19:46.334 --> 19:49.042
He complained to me that you
don't let him drink.

19:50.292 --> 19:52.125
He asks me sometimes.

19:52.667 --> 19:54.542
I'm very strict with him
in this matter.

19:55.083 --> 19:56.250
Then he stops.

19:58.667 --> 19:59.999
See if this is crispy enough,

20:10.500 --> 20:12.626
Have you gone home recently?

20:13.959 --> 20:15.375
It's been two months.

20:19.292 --> 20:21.500
I'll ask Jaya or Celine.

20:21.542 --> 20:23.125
To stay here for a day or
two so that I can go.

20:24.125 --> 20:26.209
Mamma's legs are too weak.

20:27.459 --> 20:29.167
Now Aneeta is home too.

20:29.876 --> 20:31.959
She wants to do her
Masters at Bangalore.

20:31.999 --> 20:33.125
Mamma is stressed about it.

20:34.459 --> 20:35.834
I have an uncle,

20:36.709 --> 20:38.959
He's the one who
stresses mamma out.

20:39.918 --> 20:42.959
He says that the girls who go
to Bangalore turn into sluts.

20:43.709 --> 20:45.876
When a decision is
being made at home,

20:45.918 --> 20:47.834
Keep such idiots out of it.

20:47.876 --> 20:49.250
It is easier said than done.

20:49.959 --> 20:52.542
If Pappa was alive,
he would've let her study anywhere.

20:53.999 --> 20:55.667
She cries saying the same.

20:55.999 --> 20:57.334
We talked yesterday as well.

20:58.999 --> 21:01.292
Pappa used to give
her a special care!

21:02.792 --> 21:04.334
He hasn't beaten her even once.

21:10.999 --> 21:13.709
Bangalore is not such
a problematic place.

21:13.751 --> 21:15.792
That way, trouble can be
found anywhere.

21:17.542 --> 21:19.918
I know a few people in Bangalore.

21:19.959 --> 21:22.209
There was one Sister Maria
who did B.Ed with me.

21:22.667 --> 21:23.959
I shall ask her.

21:25.999 --> 21:27.542
If she's with Nuns,

21:28.083 --> 21:29.417
Mamma would also be relieved.

21:31.918 --> 21:32.959
It's okay.

21:33.500 --> 21:34.834
We can take care of this.

21:36.292 --> 21:39.334
Saji wouldn't proactively help
me with these things.

21:42.959 --> 21:45.417
Saji uncle is an introvert, right?

21:45.459 --> 21:46.459
Yeah,

21:46.500 --> 21:47.417
He must be!

21:50.042 --> 21:51.918
But, sometimes I feel bad for him.

22:26.209 --> 22:27.792
You've got it wrong again, my dear.

22:28.999 --> 22:30.250
You're inattentive.

22:32.792 --> 22:33.999
Have you read the Wings of fire?

22:35.167 --> 22:36.292
You haven't?

22:37.834 --> 22:39.999
If we set our mind on it,
anything is possible!

22:41.250 --> 22:43.083
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

22:44.375 --> 22:45.709
Read carefully.

22:45.751 --> 22:46.667
Try again.

22:48.918 --> 22:50.626
Do you understand where
you're making mistakes?

22:51.999 --> 22:53.292
No?

22:53.459 --> 22:55.542
That's what I've been
telling you repeatedly.

22:56.250 --> 22:57.751
Read carefully now.

23:01.999 --> 23:03.876
You should read
the book I mentioned.

23:04.209 --> 23:05.083
Okay?

23:05.125 --> 23:06.667
It's said in that book,

23:06.709 --> 23:09.250
'If you truly believe that we can,
anything is possible.'

23:09.334 --> 23:12.209
Don't work mindlessly like a donkey.

23:12.626 --> 23:13.999
What should we do?

23:14.792 --> 23:16.334
Smart work is the key!

23:21.999 --> 23:22.999
Focus,

23:27.250 --> 23:28.542
Yeah, give it a try.

23:37.834 --> 23:38.876
Wrong again!

24:19.626 --> 24:22.667
"Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee
Blessed art thou amongst women"

24:22.709 --> 24:24.751
"And blessed is the fruit of thy womb"

24:24.792 --> 24:26.999
"Jesus, Holy Mary,

24:27.042 --> 24:29.292
"...sinners now and at the
hour of our death, Amen"

24:29.334 --> 24:33.083
"Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou amongst women"

24:33.125 --> 24:35.042
"and blessed is the fruit of thy womb"

24:35.083 --> 24:37.209
"Jesus, Holy Mary,
Mother of God. Pray for us..."

24:37.250 --> 24:39.250
"...sinners now and at the
hour of our death, Amen"

24:39.292 --> 24:43.334
"Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee
Blessed art thou amongst women"

24:43.375 --> 24:44.959
"And blessed is the fruit of thy womb"

"Jesus, Holy Mary,

24:47.042 --> 24:48.959
"...sinners now and at the
hour of our death, Amen"

24:48.999 --> 24:52.751
"Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee
Blessed art thou amongst women"

24:52.792 --> 24:55.209
"And blessed is the fruit of thy womb"

26:47.792 --> 26:50.542
Heard that the Leopard took a goat
from your neighborhood.

26:55.167 --> 26:56.876
Raghavan Nair's chicken,

26:57.375 --> 26:58.834
Brother Etha's calf,

27:00.209 --> 27:02.999
Soon enough, it will start
attacking humans too.

27:17.792 --> 27:20.250
What's the point of sulking so much?

27:21.959 --> 27:23.626
After all, your daughter is back.

27:26.792 --> 27:28.209
It's not like the old days.

27:29.250 --> 27:30.999
Everybody make small mistakes.

27:38.876 --> 27:41.250
Let's be glad that she's still intact.

27:45.250 --> 27:48.500
Even if she is not,

27:49.125 --> 27:51.083
There's one Doctor
Selvarajan in Theni,

27:51.959 --> 27:53.709
He is the best to deal
with such matters.

27:54.834 --> 27:56.250
I know him personally.

28:02.167 --> 28:03.459
Tell me if you want to pay a visit.

28:56.709 --> 28:58.542
Would he be here at this time?

28:58.876 --> 29:00.042
The light is on!

29:15.876 --> 29:17.626
George Vadakkeppurath died.

29:17.959 --> 29:19.417
He drank poison.

29:20.250 --> 29:21.918
His family wasn't home.

29:21.959 --> 29:23.209
The body is taken for post-mortem.

29:24.375 --> 29:26.292
Are they waiting for anyone?

29:27.125 --> 29:28.959
His wife has a brother in Kuwait.

29:29.417 --> 29:31.417
He can't come due to work.

29:31.792 --> 29:33.626
There's no one else.

29:34.667 --> 29:36.500
He's left behind two daughters.

29:36.999 --> 29:39.959
People who saw him in the evening says
he was a bit drunk.

29:40.167 --> 29:43.209
After Neethu's issue he was
a bit down mentally.

29:44.999 --> 29:46.334
What about the funeral?

29:46.667 --> 29:49.083
Can it be done in the cemetery?

29:49.792 --> 29:50.999
Will the priest allow it?

29:51.542 --> 29:53.125
There's a lot of space in the cemetery.

29:53.292 --> 29:54.999
Why further petrify the family?

29:55.918 --> 29:56.999
I'll talk to the priest.

29:57.209 --> 29:58.417
We need to ask time.

29:59.751 --> 30:01.209
Call them.
I will join there.

30:01.459 --> 30:02.500
Okay.

32:30.959 --> 32:33.999
'TV NEWS'

33:54.834 --> 33:57.626
No one's home.
Everyone has left for the funeral.

33:58.083 --> 34:00.083
Oh, I forgot about that.

34:19.167 --> 34:23.042
"Where would I go from you?"

34:23.626 --> 34:28.709
"Where would we hide lord?"

34:28.876 --> 34:33.667
"Where could we run from you?"

34:33.959 --> 34:38.999
"The sky is your abode"

34:39.042 --> 34:43.125
"You fill the seas and land"

34:44.250 --> 34:48.751
"You reside in hell's depth"

34:48.792 --> 34:52.999
"Where would we hide then lord?"

34:55.042 --> 34:59.667
"Lord you know me completely"

34:59.709 --> 35:04.751
"The sins are great"

35:04.792 --> 35:09.459
"Yet your mercy is greater"

35:09.918 --> 35:14.959
"If you don't show your mercy"

35:14.999 --> 35:19.167
"Humanity would perish like dust"

35:20.334 --> 35:23.667
"Oh lord, don't give up on"

35:23.709 --> 35:28.709
"Who took your flesh and blood"

35:29.959 --> 35:33.876
"You created and placed
your hands on me"

35:33.918 --> 35:38.834
"In the beginning, you gave life,"

35:39.125 --> 35:44.209
"You created Man in your image,"

35:44.250 --> 35:49.083
"We sinned against you,"

35:49.334 --> 35:54.250
"Don't kill us with your wrath,"

35:54.542 --> 35:59.999
"Lord shower your bliss"

36:00.042 --> 36:03.792
"On us unfortunate beings"

36:05.500 --> 36:09.918
"Princess from greatness"

36:10.042 --> 36:14.959
"Like pigeons who are on
a sacrificial pedestal,"

36:15.042 --> 36:19.999
"Stands the holy canon"

36:20.250 --> 36:24.999
"A snake breaking
into the nest,"

36:25.334 --> 36:29.959
"Comes for the pigeons"

36:30.999 --> 36:33.792
"Oh lord, don't give up on"

36:33.834 --> 36:36.834
"The canon who took
your holy blood"

37:03.709 --> 37:06.500
We're planning to build
three more like this.

37:07.167 --> 37:08.999
Then, a campfire area!

37:09.999 --> 37:11.083
One barbecue.

37:13.500 --> 37:16.542
That would attract youngsters
and families alike.

37:23.542 --> 37:24.999
I don't drink alcohol.

37:25.083 --> 37:26.125
Since when?

37:26.667 --> 37:27.959
I don't drink at all.

37:28.500 --> 37:29.334
Because it is rum?

37:29.375 --> 37:30.250
No!

37:31.209 --> 37:32.918
Anyway, I'm going to have a few drinks.

37:33.876 --> 37:35.083
No use of worrying later

37:38.042 --> 37:39.667
Sure you won't want one?

37:39.959 --> 37:41.542
You go ahead, Roy uncle.

38:08.876 --> 38:13.334
Have you noticed any change in Subin
these days?

38:16.959 --> 38:18.417
Maybe it's his age.

38:19.500 --> 38:21.292
And it's not the old times anymore.

38:22.375 --> 38:25.959
All this TV and cinema are getting
into his head.

38:35.375 --> 38:37.542
His teacher had rung me.

38:38.167 --> 38:41.459
Apparently he said something vulgar
to a girl at school.

38:43.918 --> 38:45.042
That too,

38:45.125 --> 38:46.751
To a girl older to him!

38:49.834 --> 38:53.459
We often think that our children are
incapable of things like this.

38:54.083 --> 38:55.459
What did he say?

38:56.500 --> 38:57.626
He won't tell me.

38:59.125 --> 39:00.417
Probably he's afraid.

39:02.125 --> 39:04.042
The teacher said that it's really bad.

39:05.292 --> 39:07.042
They exaggerate these things.

39:09.334 --> 39:11.834
When you get time, talk to him.

39:12.042 --> 39:12.876
Sure.

39:12.918 --> 39:14.959
He'd open up to you.

39:15.292 --> 39:16.209
I'll do that.

39:35.626 --> 39:36.876
One more game?

40:03.626 --> 40:04.834
I've to go meet Tony.

40:05.417 --> 40:07.083
Why are you meeting him every day?

40:09.250 --> 40:10.626
When will brother Sony come?

40:10.792 --> 40:11.999
He will be late.

40:12.959 --> 40:13.918
Where did he go?

40:13.959 --> 40:15.375
Some youth league meeting.

40:16.292 --> 40:18.751
Mamma, I'm going to Tony's.

40:18.834 --> 40:20.417
Subin would be alone here.

40:21.459 --> 40:22.500
I'll come back soon.

40:23.751 --> 40:25.626
Do you want any books?

40:26.250 --> 40:27.459
Anything I haven't read?

40:27.834 --> 40:29.083
Come and take a look.

41:22.292 --> 41:23.751
When will brother Sony come?

41:23.792 --> 41:25.500
He'll come late at night.

41:25.834 --> 41:27.083
Last time he came home,

41:27.125 --> 41:28.959
He promised to stay back, but left soon.

41:29.125 --> 41:30.918
He's always busy with
something or the other.

41:46.999 --> 41:49.542
Are you hungry?
Shall I get you something to eat?

41:49.667 --> 41:50.709
No, I'm good.

41:54.500 --> 41:55.959
The idiot deceived her.

41:56.334 --> 41:57.959
He has another wife and child.

41:58.209 --> 42:00.834
Really? I didn't know that.

42:01.834 --> 42:03.876
Neethu's mother has a brother
in Nedumkandam.

42:03.959 --> 42:05.500
Yeah, the politician.

42:06.250 --> 42:08.500
When she smelled trouble, she called him.

42:08.709 --> 42:11.709
His men beat him up so bad.

42:11.999 --> 42:14.334
So what? Bygones are bygones.

42:15.709 --> 42:17.209
It is easy for the ones who are gone.

42:17.542 --> 42:19.250
The ones left behind suffer.

42:20.792 --> 42:24.918
It was unbearable to see their
plight during the funeral.

42:26.751 --> 42:28.375
The people staring and all...

42:28.792 --> 42:31.250
They'll be saying things at their back.

42:33.209 --> 42:37.709
Their living conditions are
also pretty pathetic,

42:38.417 --> 42:40.167
Not even a proper road to get to the house!

42:41.999 --> 42:43.417
How about this?

42:43.542 --> 42:46.626
What if we arrange our Friday
evening program next week there?

42:47.542 --> 42:50.250
A decent road is a basic need!

42:50.459 --> 42:51.417
Right?

42:51.751 --> 42:52.834
Yeah.

42:55.876 --> 42:56.959
I'm ready.

42:57.125 --> 42:58.417
Joby?

42:58.459 --> 42:59.667
You ready?

42:59.999 --> 43:01.083
Is it Saturday?

43:01.334 --> 43:02.542
I'm not free on Friday.

43:02.626 --> 43:03.959
If it's Saturday, I'll come.

43:05.125 --> 43:06.042
What about you?

43:06.083 --> 43:07.334
Yeah, Saturday works.

43:10.209 --> 43:11.375
Listen.

43:11.542 --> 43:13.792
People say that you saw a Leopard.

43:13.918 --> 43:16.042
The Leopard must have fled seeing him.

43:18.083 --> 43:19.334
Tell us what happened.

43:20.375 --> 43:21.417
Oh, it's nothing.

43:21.751 --> 43:23.500
I was with our Tony,

43:23.626 --> 43:25.834
Both of us were going on his bike,

43:26.918 --> 43:29.083
After the late night show.

43:29.125 --> 43:30.209
Which movie?

43:30.709 --> 43:31.959
Is that important here?

43:31.999 --> 43:33.209
Continue with your story.

43:35.500 --> 43:36.626
Nothing Really!

43:37.876 --> 43:39.709
We were at the slope near Munkippallam.

43:41.999 --> 43:44.417
That's when,

43:44.459 --> 43:46.999
Both of us saw it.

43:47.042 --> 43:50.083
It was standing in the middle of the road.

43:51.375 --> 43:52.876
Looked like a painting.

43:54.083 --> 43:55.459
We couldn't turn around.

43:55.500 --> 43:56.667
What if it attacks us?

43:56.999 --> 43:58.209
Worse still, the way back is a climb.

43:58.959 --> 44:00.999
We dimmed our light and waited.

44:01.918 --> 44:05.042
For 10-15 mins it stood there still.

44:06.292 --> 44:09.042
After a while it slowly withdrew.

44:09.626 --> 44:11.459
We waited for another 15 minutes.

44:12.918 --> 44:14.334
It's not like the hearsays.

44:14.375 --> 44:17.250
When you see one for real
it's an incredible watch.

45:59.083 --> 46:00.209
Brother Sony,

46:05.626 --> 46:07.083
Can I ask you something?

46:10.417 --> 46:12.125
Are you angry with me for something?

46:13.375 --> 46:15.250
You didn't come home like you promised,

46:15.334 --> 46:17.042
You are not friendly like you used to be.

46:25.667 --> 46:27.209
I have not changed, Subin!

46:29.042 --> 46:30.999
It's you who has changed.

46:33.334 --> 46:35.292
Jaya Aunty and Roy Uncle
told me everything.

46:37.500 --> 46:39.626
Even those lower-class brats won't
do what you've done.

46:41.292 --> 46:43.751
No one in our family
has done such things.

46:43.876 --> 46:45.125
But I didn't do anything.

46:46.834 --> 46:47.876
You didn't?

46:47.918 --> 46:48.876
But you did say something!

46:50.709 --> 46:51.834
What did you say?

46:56.626 --> 46:59.042
You know it wasn't right thing to say.

47:02.375 --> 47:04.459
What if that girl hurt herself,

47:04.500 --> 47:06.083
After listening to your words?

47:06.959 --> 47:07.834
God!

47:10.751 --> 47:12.334
I turned numb after hearing about it.

47:14.751 --> 47:17.876
If it were someone else,
I wouldn't have cared,

47:20.709 --> 47:22.209
But you...

47:26.918 --> 47:29.918
I considered you more of a
brother than even Noby.

47:37.667 --> 47:39.751
You know how Roy uncle is,

47:40.459 --> 47:42.250
He was planning to send you to
a boarding school.

47:43.542 --> 47:45.959
I had to interfere to change his decision.

47:51.667 --> 47:52.959
At boarding school,

47:52.999 --> 47:55.876
Life would have been hell
with those priests.

48:08.375 --> 48:10.334
Everyone makes mistakes, Subin.

48:13.083 --> 48:15.083
If you had an interest in her,

48:15.125 --> 48:17.125
Why would you do all these?

48:18.375 --> 48:19.542
If you had just told me,

48:19.626 --> 48:23.459
I would've talked to her family and arranged
for your marriage in the future.

48:36.500 --> 48:38.083
Now leave all that.

48:38.542 --> 48:40.083
And focus on your studies.

48:46.083 --> 48:48.125
Don't disappoint pappa and mamma.

48:49.542 --> 48:53.667
You know that Roy uncle has heart issues,

48:55.626 --> 48:57.500
Don't add to his stress.

49:51.876 --> 49:55.334
They never turn up for any
program at the church,

49:55.792 --> 49:58.751
When I asked them, they didn't
even have an answer.

49:59.876 --> 50:00.918
Uncle,

50:02.209 --> 50:03.375
- Please sit.
- No

50:03.417 --> 50:04.500
It is ok.

50:11.918 --> 50:14.626
Praise be to Jesus Christ.

50:37.334 --> 50:38.999
That's a great thing.

50:39.125 --> 50:41.876
It is not about the road alone.

50:42.167 --> 50:44.834
They will feel good that there
are people by their side,

50:45.918 --> 50:47.459
We were thinking on the same lines.

50:47.918 --> 50:49.999
Our people are not saints either,

50:50.083 --> 50:51.999
They spread gossips like anything.

50:52.500 --> 50:53.999
It's a precarious situation.

50:54.167 --> 50:55.500
Let me figure out something.

50:55.876 --> 50:57.459
What did Neethu study?

50:58.417 --> 50:59.667
B.com

51:02.959 --> 51:05.918
Will she look after the account
section at the milk society?

51:06.209 --> 51:06.918
Yeah, sure.

51:06.959 --> 51:08.125
She is a capable girl.

51:08.375 --> 51:10.459
She won't run away now as she
has learned a lesson now.

51:11.999 --> 51:12.959
You're right, Father.

51:12.999 --> 51:14.542
That would be a wonderful decision.

51:15.500 --> 51:18.626
I'll mention it to Ousepachan sir.

51:18.999 --> 51:19.876
Okay.

51:21.999 --> 51:24.083
I had another good news.

51:25.209 --> 51:27.999
My appointment letter came from
the Corporate Management.

51:28.417 --> 51:29.751
I have to join next month.

51:29.999 --> 51:31.375
That's not small news!

51:31.417 --> 51:32.542
When is the party?

51:32.709 --> 51:34.042
When you prefer it.

51:34.209 --> 51:35.417
I am just kidding.

51:36.500 --> 51:37.834
When are you joining?

51:38.125 --> 51:40.417
Next month, at St.Mary's.

51:41.751 --> 51:44.083
That's nearby.
Travel distance only

51:44.959 --> 51:46.250
So, congratulations.

51:46.292 --> 51:47.918
- All the best.
- Thank you.

51:48.792 --> 51:50.209
We'll not take more of your time.

52:03.709 --> 52:04.751
Subin?

52:08.042 --> 52:09.751
Help me peel this tapioca.

52:16.375 --> 52:17.459
Are you deaf?

52:17.500 --> 52:18.417
Subin?

52:39.751 --> 52:40.709
Subi!

53:15.918 --> 53:16.918
Subi?

53:20.125 --> 53:21.125
Subin!

53:25.083 --> 53:26.375
Did you see him?

53:31.918 --> 53:33.918
Has he gone to Cumbum by any chance?

53:35.375 --> 53:36.459
Subin?

53:42.125 --> 53:44.209
Just check if there's any shoe in the water

53:47.626 --> 53:48.459
Subin?

53:49.334 --> 53:50.918
No, brother. Nothing here.

53:53.876 --> 53:54.709
Subin?

53:58.999 --> 53:59.959
Not here.

56:29.999 --> 56:30.999
Hey kid!

56:31.125 --> 56:32.250
What are you doing here?

56:38.918 --> 56:42.334
(TV News)

56:59.500 --> 57:01.042
Who are we waiting for?

57:01.792 --> 57:04.250
Annie Aunty stopped at
a friend's on the way.

57:04.459 --> 57:07.125
Sony said it will take
another 10 mins.

57:07.667 --> 57:08.876
Sony said this?

57:08.918 --> 57:10.626
Then expect them after an hour or so.

57:10.792 --> 57:13.042
For him, an hour means 10 minutes.

57:26.876 --> 57:28.667
What are you doing?

57:29.999 --> 57:32.042
She just won't listen.

57:38.209 --> 57:39.375
You sit there.

57:54.167 --> 57:55.334
Whose turn?

57:56.250 --> 57:57.167
Mine.

57:59.792 --> 58:01.167
Don't look.

58:35.375 --> 58:36.751
Subi, this is for you.

58:46.792 --> 58:47.667
Manu

58:55.209 --> 58:56.125
Jaya

58:59.292 --> 59:00.834
Do you wear stuff like these?

59:11.500 --> 59:12.667
This is for you Pappa.

59:18.999 --> 59:20.626
Keep this in the storeroom.

59:20.834 --> 59:22.042
We'll take it for Easter.

59:22.999 --> 59:25.209
Brother's bottle is in the next box.

59:36.959 --> 59:38.292
What are you two doing here?

59:40.209 --> 59:43.042
I came to check if there's some wine left.

59:56.250 --> 59:57.999
'Truly, truly, I say to you,'

59:58.083 --> 01:00:00.250
'A servant is not greater than his master'

01:00:00.292 --> 01:00:02.500
'Nor who is sent greater
than he who sent him'

01:00:02.626 --> 01:00:05.709
'If you know these things, blessed
are you if you do them'

01:00:05.751 --> 01:00:07.876
'I am not speaking of you all'

01:00:07.918 --> 01:00:09.334
'I know whom I have chosen'

01:00:09.375 --> 01:00:11.500
'It is that the scripture may be fulfilled'

01:00:11.626 --> 01:00:14.292
''He who ate my bread has
lifted his heel against me''

01:00:14.375 --> 01:00:17.542
'I tell you this now,
before it takes place'

01:00:17.626 --> 01:00:20.042
'When it does take place, you
may believe that I am he'

01:00:20.083 --> 01:00:25.334
'Truly, truly, I say to you, he who receives
any one whom I send receives me;'

01:00:25.375 --> 01:00:27.876
'And he who receives me
receives him who sent me'

01:00:36.417 --> 01:00:39.375
'Our Father, who art in heaven
hallowed be thy name'

01:00:39.459 --> 01:00:43.459
'Thy kingdom come thy will be
done on earth as it is in heaven'

01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:46.083
'Give us this day our daily
bread and forgive us'

01:00:46.125 --> 01:00:48.918
'Our trespasses as we forgive those
who trespass against us'

01:00:48.959 --> 01:00:54.334
'And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil. Amen'

01:00:54.375 --> 01:00:57.459
'Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee'

01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:59.834
'Blessed art thou amongst women'

01:00:59.876 --> 01:01:02.626
'And blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus'

01:01:02.667 --> 01:01:04.876
'Jesus, Holy Mary, Mother of God'

01:01:04.918 --> 01:01:10.500
'Pray for us sinners now and
at the hour of our death, Amen'

01:01:10.542 --> 01:01:13.334
'Glory be to the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit'

01:01:13.375 --> 01:01:17.083
'As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever
shall be, world without end. Amen'

01:02:27.542 --> 01:02:28.959
Ain't you coming in?

01:02:28.999 --> 01:02:32.375
Saji has bought three
types of meat and all.

01:02:32.417 --> 01:02:34.334
Then go a little late,

01:02:34.375 --> 01:02:35.959
Let him start on his own.

01:02:35.999 --> 01:02:38.042
He helps me out, usually.

01:02:38.083 --> 01:02:40.125
It's a new habit then.

01:02:40.167 --> 01:02:42.209
They used to show up
only before the meal.

01:02:42.250 --> 01:02:44.083
That won't work with me.

01:02:47.999 --> 01:02:50.125
To be honest, my back hurts a lot.

01:02:51.667 --> 01:02:53.542
But I wanted to talk with you,

01:02:53.626 --> 01:02:56.209
Which is why I didn't go in with them.

01:02:56.292 --> 01:02:57.667
Tell me.

01:02:58.417 --> 01:03:01.125
Don't tell anyone about
this no matter what!

01:03:02.417 --> 01:03:03.667
Why would I tell anyone?

01:03:03.709 --> 01:03:05.167
You know me well, Rani.

01:03:05.250 --> 01:03:09.042
Sister, do you find anything
fishy about Sony?

01:03:10.417 --> 01:03:11.709
Sony?

01:03:12.709 --> 01:03:15.417
He exaggerates things sometimes.

01:03:15.459 --> 01:03:16.417
Why?

01:03:16.959 --> 01:03:19.334
I don't know how to say this.

01:03:19.918 --> 01:03:20.876
Yesterday,

01:03:20.918 --> 01:03:23.834
When I went to storeroom to
keep Pappa's bottle,

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:27.709
I saw Aleena and Sony come out
of the room in a hurry.

01:03:28.125 --> 01:03:30.209
Maybe I'm imagining things,

01:03:30.250 --> 01:03:32.459
Which is why I thought of
asking you about it.

01:03:33.709 --> 01:03:36.999
Have you noticed how Sony
is with the children?

01:03:37.959 --> 01:03:40.542
Sony is a bit over friendly with children

01:03:42.918 --> 01:03:44.999
Did you just see them
come out of the room?

01:03:47.999 --> 01:03:50.500
Everyone else was in the living room.

01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:56.042
'And, Celine was looking for
Aleena earlier.'

01:03:58.999 --> 01:04:00.999
'I tried talking to Aleena'

01:04:01.459 --> 01:04:04.250
'About why they were alone in the room.'

01:04:05.083 --> 01:04:07.542
She turned pale after seeing me!

01:04:08.709 --> 01:04:10.417
Did Sony say anything?

01:04:10.999 --> 01:04:13.459
He said he was looking for wine bottles.

01:04:13.626 --> 01:04:14.834
Oh!

01:04:14.918 --> 01:04:16.834
No wonder Aleena was scared.

01:04:17.209 --> 01:04:19.542
Celine is very strict about such things.

01:04:19.999 --> 01:04:21.999
I don't think that's all about it, sister,

01:04:23.125 --> 01:04:25.459
Aleena seemed stressed.

01:04:29.209 --> 01:04:31.125
When we are pregnant

01:04:31.250 --> 01:04:34.834
We feel overprotective about children!

01:04:35.834 --> 01:04:37.834
When I was pregnant with Subin,

01:04:37.918 --> 01:04:40.626
Every time I heard some news on TV

01:04:40.999 --> 01:04:42.334
I used to cry.

01:04:45.542 --> 01:04:47.751
Rani, did you discuss this
with anyone else?

01:04:48.125 --> 01:04:49.209
No.

01:04:52.125 --> 01:04:54.500
I've known Sony for a long time.

01:04:55.459 --> 01:04:57.542
He has struggled a lot in life.

01:04:59.375 --> 01:05:02.125
His home wasn't a great
place to grow up in.

01:05:02.709 --> 01:05:05.250
Things are getting better for him only now.

01:05:06.042 --> 01:05:08.209
Rani, don't tell anyone about this.

01:05:08.751 --> 01:05:11.751
People are always waiting for some gossip.

01:06:02.999 --> 01:06:05.417
Mom has been calling out for you.

01:06:05.876 --> 01:06:07.542
Dad saw me going out.

01:06:09.709 --> 01:06:10.751
You know,

01:06:10.792 --> 01:06:14.334
We're planning to build a road to
the late George's house.

01:06:15.417 --> 01:06:16.709
Can you make it?

01:06:16.999 --> 01:06:18.125
When?

01:06:18.209 --> 01:06:19.918
Day after tomorrow evening.

01:06:19.959 --> 01:06:20.999
Let me see.

01:06:22.792 --> 01:06:24.959
The boys asked for you last week.

01:06:24.999 --> 01:06:25.876
Quiet please.

01:06:25.918 --> 01:06:27.667
You'll scare the fish away.

01:06:36.834 --> 01:06:41.250
Did you take Rs 500 from mom for driving?

01:06:43.334 --> 01:06:44.500
Mom told me.

01:06:46.209 --> 01:06:47.500
Who's teaching you?

01:06:48.876 --> 01:06:49.959
Tony.

01:06:52.125 --> 01:06:55.375
Why go to them
when there's a bike here?

01:06:57.125 --> 01:06:58.292
I'm free today.

01:06:58.334 --> 01:07:00.125
We can go to the ground in the evening.

01:07:00.999 --> 01:07:02.500
I've already requested Tony.

01:07:02.542 --> 01:07:04.125
He will come by evening.

01:07:08.334 --> 01:07:10.042
Then take my bike with you.

01:07:10.083 --> 01:07:11.250
No, I'm fine.

01:07:11.417 --> 01:07:13.459
I'll have to pay for petrol, anyway.

01:07:13.834 --> 01:07:15.500
I have filled the tank.

01:07:15.834 --> 01:07:16.959
It's okay, Sony.

01:07:16.999 --> 01:07:18.834
I told you Tony will teach me.

01:08:31.751 --> 01:08:32.834
Are you tired?

01:08:32.999 --> 01:08:34.125
Not at all.

01:08:35.250 --> 01:08:36.792
We're used to this.

01:08:41.125 --> 01:08:42.375
Let's have tea.

01:08:43.918 --> 01:08:45.500
Has Neenu gone back to the hostel?

01:08:45.542 --> 01:08:46.667
Yeah.

01:08:53.459 --> 01:08:54.626
Here, take it.

01:09:02.292 --> 01:09:03.834
How is your mom now?

01:09:03.999 --> 01:09:07.125
She puts on a smile when you're around.

01:09:07.292 --> 01:09:08.918
But she's crying all day.

01:09:09.292 --> 01:09:11.167
She's not eating or sleeping.

01:09:13.751 --> 01:09:16.334
They've been together for years.

01:09:16.709 --> 01:09:19.042
Must be a huge shock for her.

01:09:20.959 --> 01:09:22.751
Children can adjust better.

01:09:22.876 --> 01:09:24.876
I'm not undervaluing your grief.

01:09:25.209 --> 01:09:26.918
You have no choice, right?

01:09:27.459 --> 01:09:29.125
But in a marriage,

01:09:29.542 --> 01:09:32.542
They hope to be together till the end.

01:09:33.083 --> 01:09:34.209
That's true.

01:09:34.375 --> 01:09:38.083
She looks at the photo album,
at least thrice a day, and cry.

01:09:40.709 --> 01:09:42.999
Have you decided anything
for the committal?

01:09:43.042 --> 01:09:44.042
No.

01:09:44.083 --> 01:09:46.292
I am in a haze always.

01:09:46.626 --> 01:09:48.417
Absent minded most of the time.

01:09:49.834 --> 01:09:51.709
There are 10-15 days left.

01:09:52.042 --> 01:09:53.667
We'll get it done neatly.

01:09:54.250 --> 01:09:56.209
Do you have any money with you Neethu?

01:09:57.417 --> 01:09:59.876
Money? I can ask Uncle.

01:10:01.250 --> 01:10:02.167
No, It's ok.

01:10:02.209 --> 01:10:04.083
Don't bother him for everything.

01:10:04.125 --> 01:10:05.876
We will arrange it ourselves.

01:10:06.542 --> 01:10:09.083
Even relatives get tired after a while.

01:10:10.083 --> 01:10:12.626
Thank you Sony, I don't know
how to thank you.

01:10:13.292 --> 01:10:14.375
It's okay.

01:10:14.459 --> 01:10:17.709
We try to help our people in need.

01:10:18.042 --> 01:10:19.209
Nothing special.

01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:26.667
That's it.

01:10:28.918 --> 01:10:30.167
Leave it.

01:10:32.626 --> 01:10:33.626
Take it.

01:10:33.667 --> 01:10:35.209
I shall

01:10:36.876 --> 01:10:38.500
Well done, good play.

01:10:40.999 --> 01:10:42.334
Superb

01:11:22.876 --> 01:11:23.876
Tony

01:11:26.167 --> 01:11:27.125
Come here.

01:11:27.167 --> 01:11:28.667
What is it, Sony?

01:11:28.709 --> 01:11:29.918
Were you away, Tony?

01:11:29.959 --> 01:11:31.334
Haven't seen you in a while.

01:11:31.375 --> 01:11:32.959
- I was here only.
- Yeah?

01:11:32.999 --> 01:11:34.083
Yeah.

01:11:34.125 --> 01:11:37.292
I haven't seen you in our
church programs lately.

01:11:37.626 --> 01:11:39.125
I was wondering where you have been?

01:11:39.167 --> 01:11:40.876
I had a chat with your father.

01:11:41.999 --> 01:11:43.709
What are your plans now?

01:11:43.918 --> 01:11:45.250
Father must be-

01:11:45.417 --> 01:11:46.876
I was thinking,

01:11:46.918 --> 01:11:48.876
I have 2-3 friends in Ernakulam,

01:11:49.417 --> 01:11:52.375
We're thinking of building a start up,

01:11:53.334 --> 01:11:54.999
Let that happen on the side

01:11:55.375 --> 01:11:56.918
Write PSC Examination.

01:11:57.292 --> 01:12:00.209
People are dying to land
on an LD clerk job,

01:12:00.918 --> 01:12:02.709
If you prepare well,

01:12:02.751 --> 01:12:04.459
And get an LD clerk's job,

01:12:04.876 --> 01:12:06.042
Within 10 years,

01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:07.918
How old are you?

01:12:07.999 --> 01:12:09.250
I'm twenty-

01:12:09.292 --> 01:12:10.334
By the age of 30

01:12:10.375 --> 01:12:12.083
You will be gazetted officer.

01:12:12.626 --> 01:12:13.876
I'm not joking.

01:12:14.209 --> 01:12:15.542
But you should try.

01:12:15.792 --> 01:12:16.834
Okay?

01:12:18.292 --> 01:12:19.542
I will write it, Sony.

01:12:19.792 --> 01:12:23.250
I was looking for some work anyway.

01:12:23.876 --> 01:12:25.042
I'll give it a shot.

01:12:25.125 --> 01:12:25.959
Very good.

01:12:25.999 --> 01:12:27.083
Take this serious.

01:12:27.125 --> 01:12:28.417
Prepare well.

01:12:28.876 --> 01:12:30.751
I have some study material with me.

01:12:30.792 --> 01:12:31.999
I will give them to you.

01:12:32.042 --> 01:12:32.792
Yeah

01:12:32.834 --> 01:12:33.709
It's possible.

01:12:33.751 --> 01:12:34.250
Yeah

01:12:34.292 --> 01:12:35.334
I will give it a try.

01:12:35.375 --> 01:12:37.083
- Trust me.
- Yes, I'll write.

01:13:11.999 --> 01:13:13.292
What's his name?

01:13:14.918 --> 01:13:16.042
Afzal

01:13:16.751 --> 01:13:18.209
He's her classmate.

01:13:18.918 --> 01:13:22.167
He says that he can't live without her.

01:13:22.751 --> 01:13:24.999
She's also on the same track now.

01:13:27.999 --> 01:13:30.125
Neenu doesn't know how serious this is.

01:13:32.417 --> 01:13:33.959
Try talking to her.

01:13:35.167 --> 01:13:36.042
If it doesn't work,

01:13:36.083 --> 01:13:37.918
I'll ask the priest to have
a chat with her.

01:13:38.292 --> 01:13:39.334
Okay.

01:13:41.667 --> 01:13:43.999
But, she isn't ready to talk about it.

01:13:48.167 --> 01:13:49.459
Should we go there?

01:13:51.125 --> 01:13:51.959
To Bangalore?

01:13:51.999 --> 01:13:52.959
Yeah?

01:13:52.999 --> 01:13:54.250
Are you crazy?

01:14:01.626 --> 01:14:03.959
If I say something she'll ask,

01:14:04.792 --> 01:14:06.876
What right do I have to advise her?

01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:10.999
In a way she's right.

01:14:15.999 --> 01:14:17.959
See, everyone makes mistakes.

01:14:18.334 --> 01:14:20.876
What matters is understanding
and overcoming them.

01:14:22.334 --> 01:14:22.999
What else?

01:14:23.042 --> 01:14:24.999
Live in guilt forever?

01:14:28.918 --> 01:14:30.292
You have a big heart, Sony.

01:15:23.876 --> 01:15:25.042
This one?

01:15:25.083 --> 01:15:26.375
No, the one below

01:15:26.417 --> 01:15:27.834
- This?
- Yeah

01:15:34.375 --> 01:15:35.417
That's it?

01:15:35.542 --> 01:15:36.626
That's it.

01:16:13.999 --> 01:16:15.918
Now recite this on your own.

01:16:19.334 --> 01:16:20.459
Get up

01:16:21.459 --> 01:16:22.876
Let's finish this tonight itself.

01:16:22.959 --> 01:16:24.334
If you set your mind on it, it's possible.

01:16:25.709 --> 01:16:28.667
'Let me take rest here for a while'

01:16:30.459 --> 01:16:31.417
Subin!

01:16:31.876 --> 01:16:33.417
Mamma will scold you.

01:16:33.792 --> 01:16:37.250
We can skip some lines if you want.

01:16:38.626 --> 01:16:39.667
Okay?

01:16:44.751 --> 01:16:46.375
What a beautiful poem!

01:16:46.918 --> 01:16:48.626
We must really feel it while reciting,

01:16:48.667 --> 01:16:49.959
Or it won't work.

01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:51.959
How can I feel

01:16:51.999 --> 01:16:53.751
Like a 50 year old poet?

01:16:53.959 --> 01:16:55.334
Are you big enough to teach him?

01:16:55.375 --> 01:16:56.918
Learn the poem first.

01:18:20.876 --> 01:18:23.042
The elders should feel
responsible at least.

01:18:23.292 --> 01:18:25.209
It won't go well if I talk to him.

01:18:25.334 --> 01:18:26.918
Don't give excuses.

01:18:26.999 --> 01:18:28.834
If you tell him, he will listen.

01:18:29.125 --> 01:18:31.125
She's from a good, pious family.

01:18:31.459 --> 01:18:32.626
They are farmers.

01:18:32.667 --> 01:18:33.918
Which is good for us.

01:18:33.959 --> 01:18:36.125
There's no excessive money or pride.

01:18:36.626 --> 01:18:38.792
Who is interested in money and pride?

01:18:38.999 --> 01:18:40.417
The girl must be a good one.

01:18:40.626 --> 01:18:43.167
She should be able to do things sensibly.

01:18:44.042 --> 01:18:46.083
First, let's see if he's interested.

01:18:46.542 --> 01:18:48.792
He'll like her if he doesn't
have many demands.

01:18:58.626 --> 01:19:00.042
Curly hair it seems!

01:19:00.959 --> 01:19:03.042
She's doing Bsc nursing, third year.

01:19:03.334 --> 01:19:04.834
She studies well.

01:19:05.459 --> 01:19:07.792
She can go abroad after the studies.

01:19:09.292 --> 01:19:11.751
They are very loyal to the parish.

01:19:11.918 --> 01:19:13.292
Very good girl.

01:19:13.792 --> 01:19:15.626
What about the her brother?

01:19:15.959 --> 01:19:17.042
He's in high school.

01:19:19.459 --> 01:19:23.959
We waited to get him married,
for him to secure a job first.

01:19:25.417 --> 01:19:27.167
He's got a job now.

01:19:28.292 --> 01:19:29.375
Yeah!

01:19:29.459 --> 01:19:30.250
We'll go.

01:19:30.292 --> 01:19:31.417
Let's see.

01:19:32.459 --> 01:19:36.334
'In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit'

01:19:36.667 --> 01:19:38.042
'Amen'

01:19:38.125 --> 01:19:40.083
'God, our creator and redeemer'

01:19:40.125 --> 01:19:43.125
'May your blessings reside in our minds'

01:19:43.375 --> 01:19:46.542
'May your kindness wash away our sins'

01:19:46.999 --> 01:19:49.417
'May you grant eternal life to'

01:19:49.459 --> 01:19:52.083
'Our brother who died in
the hope of Resurrection'

01:19:52.459 --> 01:19:54.083
'Oh lord of life and death'

01:19:54.125 --> 01:19:56.999
'Lord who are the father,
the son, and the holy spirit'

01:19:57.334 --> 01:20:00.834
'Amen'

01:20:01.209 --> 01:20:03.000
'Lord who purifies the sinners,'

01:20:03.042 --> 01:20:04.792
'Who resurrects the dead,'

01:20:04.959 --> 01:20:08.125
'Who grants the fruit for our labors'

01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:11.042
'May you forgive our brother's sins'

01:20:11.334 --> 01:20:13.292
'Oh lord of life and death'

01:20:13.459 --> 01:20:16.334
'Lord who are the father,
the son, and the holy spirit'

01:20:16.542 --> 01:20:17.834
'Amen'

01:20:17.876 --> 01:20:22.167
'Born as a mortal into this world'

01:20:22.209 --> 01:20:24.626
'Death is the end'

01:20:24.918 --> 01:20:29.083
'Most sacred will of Lord, it is'

01:20:29.125 --> 01:20:31.959
'None can escape'

01:20:32.834 --> 01:20:37.209
'Born as a mortal into this world'

01:20:37.542 --> 01:20:39.834
'Death is the end'

01:20:40.375 --> 01:20:44.667
'Most sacred will of Lord, it is'

01:20:44.999 --> 01:20:47.751
'None can escape'

01:20:48.167 --> 01:20:54.667
'From the father, death
will separate the son'

01:20:54.999 --> 01:20:57.626
'On an unfortunate day'

01:20:57.667 --> 01:21:01.999
'The son will be separated from his mother'

01:21:02.334 --> 01:21:07.042
'Born as a mortal into this world'

01:21:07.083 --> 01:21:09.626
'Death is the end'

01:21:09.999 --> 01:21:14.834
'Most sacred will of Lord, it is'

01:21:15.167 --> 01:21:17.709
'None can escape'

01:21:18.918 --> 01:21:25.083
'Hands won't move, Lips won't move ever'

01:21:25.459 --> 01:21:29.918
'Eyes will darken, Ears will shut'

01:21:30.125 --> 01:21:32.709
'Dark shadow ascends'

01:21:33.250 --> 01:21:37.751
'Born as a mortal into this world'

01:21:37.876 --> 01:21:40.542
'Death is the end'

01:21:40.918 --> 01:21:45.542
'Most sacred will of Lord, it is'

01:21:45.792 --> 01:21:48.999
'None can escape'

01:21:49.918 --> 01:21:52.834
Father, did the Sacristan
say anything to you?

01:21:54.792 --> 01:21:59.250
Can you do something about it?

01:22:05.334 --> 01:22:06.500
Sony, come, sit.

01:22:06.959 --> 01:22:08.918
Please move over.

01:22:15.792 --> 01:22:18.792
I wanted to ask you something
for a while now.

01:22:21.709 --> 01:22:23.417
If you're free on Sundays

01:22:23.999 --> 01:22:26.542
Please don't ask me to teach catechism.

01:22:27.459 --> 01:22:28.667
Nothing like that

01:22:34.667 --> 01:22:39.042
I was looking for someone to teach
catechism at high school level.

01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:42.999
We need you!

01:22:43.709 --> 01:22:46.626
Would have been easier
if it was a lower grade.

01:22:47.792 --> 01:22:48.751
That's possible.

01:22:48.792 --> 01:22:49.876
A lower grade!

01:22:49.918 --> 01:22:51.167
We can manage.

01:23:02.209 --> 01:23:03.417
I'll be back, Aunty!

01:23:04.125 --> 01:23:05.459
When did you come, Aunty?

01:23:05.709 --> 01:23:06.709
It's been a while.

01:23:06.751 --> 01:23:08.500
I was waiting for you.

01:23:08.876 --> 01:23:11.999
I went with the priest for a house prayer.

01:23:13.083 --> 01:23:14.918
I couldn't meet him this time!

01:23:15.292 --> 01:23:17.083
I'll go to the church tomorrow.

01:23:17.209 --> 01:23:18.292
Why don't you stay here today?

01:23:18.334 --> 01:23:19.709
I can drop you there tomorrow.

01:23:20.459 --> 01:23:22.209
It's okay, I'll sleep at the convent.

01:23:22.292 --> 01:23:23.626
Who is the Mother Superior now?

01:23:24.626 --> 01:23:25.959
The former principal

01:23:25.999 --> 01:23:27.667
Sister Catherine?

01:23:27.834 --> 01:23:29.042
Oh yes.

01:23:29.459 --> 01:23:31.500
Sony, Can you drop me there?

01:23:31.876 --> 01:23:32.834
Of course

01:23:33.751 --> 01:23:35.751
Give me 2 minutes

01:23:36.209 --> 01:23:37.500
I will get the car.

01:23:40.834 --> 01:23:43.918
Sony, aunty was waiting to
talk to you in person.

01:23:46.292 --> 01:23:49.083
There's a retreat center in Peermade.

01:23:52.125 --> 01:23:54.918
I was there during Easter last year.

01:23:56.626 --> 01:24:00.125
The priest's prayer is so full of grace.

01:24:02.042 --> 01:24:04.999
He can read even our deepest
struggles and secrets.

01:24:07.876 --> 01:24:09.250
Next month

01:24:09.292 --> 01:24:12.125
They are starting a special
retreat for the youth.

01:24:15.292 --> 01:24:17.417
It's a batch of three days.

01:24:18.709 --> 01:24:20.542
It will be a great experience.

01:24:21.083 --> 01:24:23.042
I attended our parish retreat.

01:24:23.083 --> 01:24:24.751
A retreat an year is sufficient, right?

01:24:25.125 --> 01:24:26.626
No, this is different.

01:24:27.999 --> 01:24:31.209
From my experiences and prayers,

01:24:31.751 --> 01:24:34.751
I know certain things by intuition.

01:24:39.792 --> 01:24:41.876
God is watching every deed of ours,

01:24:42.125 --> 01:24:44.999
And he is judging us.

01:24:47.417 --> 01:24:51.083
Sony must know this better than I do

01:24:55.042 --> 01:24:57.542
Everybody make mistakes.

01:24:58.209 --> 01:25:00.042
But if you sincerely repent,

01:25:00.125 --> 01:25:02.417
And pray, the lord forgives.

01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:08.918
You have had your share of silliness.

01:25:09.626 --> 01:25:11.167
Now that's enough.

01:25:14.083 --> 01:25:16.876
You're entering a new phase in your life

01:25:17.459 --> 01:25:18.999
You should get married to a good girl too.

01:25:25.209 --> 01:25:27.667
Father Rafael will pray for you.

01:25:29.250 --> 01:25:34.542
So many sick and trouble people get healed,

01:25:34.626 --> 01:25:37.667
...there everyday, even the incurable ones.

01:25:39.209 --> 01:25:41.167
And the counseling!

01:25:42.876 --> 01:25:44.918
It is done so thoroughly!

01:25:45.125 --> 01:25:46.375
I will go, Aunty.

01:25:52.792 --> 01:25:54.918
I'll contact the Father then

01:25:54.959 --> 01:25:56.042
Yeah!

01:25:56.250 --> 01:25:58.250
It will be a great experience.

01:25:59.250 --> 01:26:01.709
You'll lose nothing by dedicating
those three days!

01:26:21.876 --> 01:26:23.042
Coffee!

01:26:23.876 --> 01:26:25.999
Yeah keep it there.
I will come.

01:26:58.292 --> 01:27:00.209
Sister?
Anything serious?

01:27:00.375 --> 01:27:01.626
No, he's normal.

01:27:02.584 --> 01:27:04.292
Seems you have got a new TV?

01:27:04.667 --> 01:27:06.751
Saji got it to watch he world cup.

01:27:10.792 --> 01:27:12.417
There's some banana left

01:27:12.751 --> 01:27:14.834
Shall I quickly make some banana fritters?

01:27:15.083 --> 01:27:15.959
No.

01:27:15.999 --> 01:27:17.167
Sit down.

01:27:29.834 --> 01:27:32.000
This is some tonic for you.

01:27:42.042 --> 01:27:43.459
These are for Pappa.

01:27:43.542 --> 01:27:45.167
You know them, right?

01:27:45.209 --> 01:27:46.250
Yeah

01:28:01.999 --> 01:28:04.459
I've been in the service for 26 years.

01:28:05.626 --> 01:28:08.125
We started the institution
with 14 children.

01:28:09.792 --> 01:28:11.876
Now, we have 126 children.

01:28:15.918 --> 01:28:19.626
I have faced a lot of troubles
during these years

01:28:21.834 --> 01:28:24.250
Sometimes what we see and experience

01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:27.209
Can be totally against our
understanding of the world.

01:28:30.792 --> 01:28:33.375
Then you lay your burden to God and go on.

01:28:35.209 --> 01:28:36.918
Was there any reward for all that?

01:28:37.125 --> 01:28:38.751
Yes. And not just for me,

01:28:38.959 --> 01:28:42.500
But for our entire family as well.

01:28:45.334 --> 01:28:47.167
What I am getting at is

01:28:47.792 --> 01:28:49.125
A Family

01:28:49.417 --> 01:28:52.834
Is not made of a father, mother,
husband and children alone.

01:28:53.667 --> 01:28:55.626
It includes many others as well.

01:28:57.918 --> 01:29:01.083
I heard that you raised
an allegation against Sony.

01:29:01.292 --> 01:29:02.751
Oh no, sister,

01:29:03.042 --> 01:29:04.999
I just discussed it with Jaya

01:29:05.292 --> 01:29:07.167
I didn't mean anything wrong.

01:29:07.209 --> 01:29:08.751
That's what I am talking about.

01:29:10.834 --> 01:29:13.083
Jaya didn't want to talk about it at all.

01:29:14.292 --> 01:29:17.999
She was under a lot of stress after
hearing what you said.

01:29:20.876 --> 01:29:24.667
When you make such statements,
Without enough conviction and clarity,

01:29:25.459 --> 01:29:28.834
You should consider the people
who will be affected by it.

01:29:29.542 --> 01:29:31.209
Especially if you're a woman.

01:29:32.417 --> 01:29:34.250
When you behave irresponsibly,

01:29:34.292 --> 01:29:36.167
You will suffer the consequences.

01:29:41.125 --> 01:29:43.667
Sony is like a son to everyone.

01:29:45.626 --> 01:29:46.959
I've never heard anyone say

01:29:46.999 --> 01:29:49.250
Anything bad about him.

01:29:53.542 --> 01:29:56.751
Did you think about Celine?

01:29:57.083 --> 01:30:01.125
What she'd feel after hearing such things
about her daughter?

01:30:04.375 --> 01:30:06.709
You also have a baby growing inside of you.

01:30:09.500 --> 01:30:12.959
Our children might not grow up
according to our expectations

01:30:19.792 --> 01:30:21.667
When mummy was alive

01:30:22.959 --> 01:30:25.334
She never missed chanting
the rosary every evening.

01:30:25.834 --> 01:30:27.125
It is all gone now.

01:30:27.751 --> 01:30:32.709
All sinful and evil thoughts could
be curbed with prayers.

01:30:37.876 --> 01:30:42.667
Stop watching all these prime-time
television series.

01:30:42.876 --> 01:30:44.999
That would help you to retrieve ground.

01:31:03.918 --> 01:31:05.417
Give this to Saji.

01:31:46.167 --> 01:31:47.667
I'm taking Rs 500.

01:31:49.918 --> 01:31:52.167
You met the marriage-broker, right?

01:31:53.083 --> 01:31:53.999
Didn't you?

01:31:56.042 --> 01:31:57.584
That won't work out.

01:31:58.999 --> 01:32:01.500
I know that you're riding
around with that chick.

01:32:02.250 --> 01:32:04.459
If you dream of marrying her,
it won't happen.

01:32:05.375 --> 01:32:08.209
Now if you're convinced to
ruin our family's name,

01:32:09.125 --> 01:32:10.667
You can step out first
and do whatever.

01:32:56.167 --> 01:32:57.876
I'm gonna say this bluntly

01:32:58.209 --> 01:33:01.626
This relationship is not going to work
out for either families.

01:33:03.042 --> 01:33:05.751
After she has roamed around having fun.

01:33:05.999 --> 01:33:08.083
Don't blame my boy later.

01:33:10.042 --> 01:33:11.125
I'll be honest.

01:33:11.167 --> 01:33:14.709
We're not interested in this relationship.

01:33:16.542 --> 01:33:18.500
We are not going to trouble you in any way.

01:33:18.667 --> 01:33:20.334
So don't trouble us either.

01:33:43.959 --> 01:33:45.999
It's been a month since I confessed,

01:33:46.125 --> 01:33:49.167
I fight with my father over
the slightest things,

01:33:49.626 --> 01:33:51.375
At times I could not forgive,

01:33:51.417 --> 01:33:54.083
Often, I stressed on my self-importance,

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.667
I skipped the holy mass
pretending I was busy,

01:33:59.959 --> 01:34:03.167
I acted without kindness towards
people who are inferior to me,

01:34:03.876 --> 01:34:05.999
Father, forgive me for my sins.

01:34:08.542 --> 01:34:11.083
Never skip the holy mass,

01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:12.751
It's a great sin.

01:34:13.999 --> 01:34:17.250
Jesus taught us patience and forgiveness.

01:34:17.792 --> 01:34:19.834
We should practice it in our lives.

01:34:19.876 --> 01:34:22.500
Treat others kindly and forgive them.

01:34:23.626 --> 01:34:24.751
As repentance, say

01:34:24.792 --> 01:34:28.792
Our father who art in heaven,
Hail Mary and Glory be to the father

01:34:30.709 --> 01:34:32.709
With the power that is vested in me

01:34:32.751 --> 01:34:34.500
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit,

01:34:34.542 --> 01:34:35.918
Your sins are absolved.

01:34:42.667 --> 01:34:44.999
I haven't slept properly for a long time!

01:34:46.834 --> 01:34:48.834
Why did you do this to me, Sony?

01:34:50.876 --> 01:34:52.334
Now, I'm the culprit?

01:34:52.918 --> 01:34:55.626
Yeah, I'm the man here so
I must be at fault.

01:35:07.999 --> 01:35:09.959
We have turned into strangers!

01:35:16.167 --> 01:35:18.000
If you were so afraid of your family,

01:35:18.042 --> 01:35:20.250
Why did you give me hope, Sony?

01:35:21.125 --> 01:35:22.876
Why should I be brave, Neethu?

01:35:22.918 --> 01:35:24.584
So that my family would kill themselves?

01:35:30.667 --> 01:35:32.292
I didn't mean it that way, Neethu!

01:35:32.459 --> 01:35:33.626
Sorry.

01:35:35.459 --> 01:35:37.250
You didn't say anything untrue.

01:35:38.876 --> 01:35:42.083
Any sane man would go mad
living in that house.

01:35:42.250 --> 01:35:43.709
You don't understand!

01:35:46.292 --> 01:35:48.959
Sister Aunty would support us, you said.

01:35:50.292 --> 01:35:53.667
Sister Aunty signed me in for a retreat
after witnessing my plight!

01:35:57.167 --> 01:35:59.918
You are going through
all this because of me.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.751
I just feel numb towards everything.

01:36:06.834 --> 01:36:08.500
I don't understand
what's happening.

01:36:10.042 --> 01:36:12.292
I had a lot of optimism in life!

01:36:12.751 --> 01:36:14.167
Everything is gone in a second.

01:36:15.167 --> 01:36:16.375
Sony

01:36:17.999 --> 01:36:19.292
Sony, I'm sorry

01:36:20.459 --> 01:36:21.626
Really!

01:36:55.626 --> 01:36:57.500
The one who said,
I don't want this father...

01:36:57.709 --> 01:36:59.626
I just want my friends...

01:36:59.999 --> 01:37:02.417
I just want my immoral pleasures...

01:37:02.459 --> 01:37:04.959
I just want my alcohol and drugs...

01:37:05.209 --> 01:37:09.083
I just want my blind gratifications...

01:37:09.334 --> 01:37:11.083
Eventually realizes!

01:37:12.999 --> 01:37:15.667
When he was alone
without a single penny,

01:37:16.083 --> 01:37:19.918
When the entire world and
his friends deserted him,

01:37:20.083 --> 01:37:22.250
He thinks in his solitude,

01:37:22.876 --> 01:37:24.542
What if my father was here?

01:37:28.709 --> 01:37:31.209
I've done great wrong to my father.

01:37:32.209 --> 01:37:34.375
Will he accept me if I go back?

01:37:35.876 --> 01:37:37.667
Won't he throw me out?

01:37:39.292 --> 01:37:41.500
His soul told him,

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:43.250
'You idiot'

01:37:45.584 --> 01:37:48.125
What do you know about a father's love?

01:37:51.417 --> 01:37:52.667
Hallelujah!

01:37:52.999 --> 01:37:54.167
Praise the Lord!

01:37:55.334 --> 01:37:57.125
The book of Jeremiah,

01:37:57.626 --> 01:38:00.792
Chapter 29:11 says that

01:38:01.834 --> 01:38:04.459
'For I know the plans I have for you,'

01:38:05.417 --> 01:38:10.417
'Plans to prosper you
and not to harm you'

01:38:10.542 --> 01:38:11.667
Hallelujah!

01:38:12.083 --> 01:38:13.375
Praise the lord!

01:38:13.626 --> 01:38:16.083
'Plans to prosper you
and not to harm you'

01:38:16.125 --> 01:38:17.542
Everyone get up.

01:38:17.792 --> 01:38:19.125
Hold your hands up.

01:38:20.459 --> 01:38:24.417
Towards the abode of Jesus,

01:38:24.500 --> 01:38:26.500
We can worship the Lord,

01:38:26.542 --> 01:38:36.334
Hallelujah!!

01:38:36.751 --> 01:38:43.459
Jesus...we praise You!

01:38:43.500 --> 01:38:45.667
Jesus...we thank You!

01:38:45.709 --> 01:38:52.751
Hallelujah!!

01:38:53.375 --> 01:38:54.999
Wave your hands.

01:38:55.500 --> 01:38:59.500
"Jesus my Lord"

01:39:00.125 --> 01:39:02.667
'Clap your hands and worship the Lord!'

01:39:02.792 --> 01:39:28.125
Hallelujah!

01:39:29.918 --> 01:39:31.042
Close your eyes!

01:39:33.083 --> 01:39:36.542
Can you hear Jesus calling you?

01:39:39.125 --> 01:39:40.459
My dear Sony

01:39:41.959 --> 01:39:43.792
Why are you getting afraid?

01:39:45.667 --> 01:39:50.375
Did you think your Jesus
didn't notice all this?

01:39:52.250 --> 01:39:53.792
Do you understand now?

01:39:55.042 --> 01:39:58.292
Jesus was waiting for you all this time?

01:39:59.167 --> 01:40:00.292
Do you?

01:40:02.334 --> 01:40:03.292
Now

01:40:03.876 --> 01:40:07.542
You must talk to that heavenly father.

01:40:09.292 --> 01:40:10.751
Confess to Him

01:40:11.542 --> 01:40:13.375
And by evening's holy mass,

01:40:13.792 --> 01:40:15.959
You will receive Him in your heart.

01:40:17.626 --> 01:40:19.792
Not like how you used to
receive Him before.

01:40:21.500 --> 01:40:22.834
But wholly and full heartedly,

01:40:23.209 --> 01:40:25.125
Brimming in Jesus alone.

01:40:27.792 --> 01:40:31.209
The body's thirst grow

01:40:32.334 --> 01:40:36.459
When the soul projects its thirst.

01:40:38.792 --> 01:40:41.500
If you are one with Jesus,

01:40:42.167 --> 01:40:45.042
Evil thoughts and behaviours
wouldn't occur to you.

01:40:46.417 --> 01:40:58.626
Hallelujah

01:41:16.459 --> 01:41:17.500
My child

01:41:18.876 --> 01:41:19.959
Sony

01:41:21.542 --> 01:41:23.042
Aunty sees the great changes...

01:41:23.667 --> 01:41:25.999
About to happen in your life.

01:41:27.542 --> 01:41:32.292
Your anger and arrogance with
your earthly father

01:41:32.334 --> 01:41:35.292
Will be solved with the help of God.

01:41:35.918 --> 01:41:36.999
Okay?

01:41:37.500 --> 01:41:39.626
Jesus will teach you to forgive.

01:41:40.250 --> 01:41:42.500
You need to forgive to be forgiven.

01:41:43.125 --> 01:41:44.292
Okay?

01:41:45.083 --> 01:41:46.125
And also

01:41:46.626 --> 01:41:49.375
Someone you've never met...

01:41:49.751 --> 01:41:52.999
Will be your partner with
the help of Jesus.

01:41:54.751 --> 01:41:56.751
Jesus will do the needful.

01:41:58.918 --> 01:42:01.667
Everything you wanted in life...

01:42:01.751 --> 01:42:05.334
Including foreign trips,
will manifest for you.

01:42:06.542 --> 01:42:07.542
Okay?

01:42:09.959 --> 01:42:11.792
Jesus

01:42:11.834 --> 01:42:13.999
Jesus, I praise you!

01:46:17.083 --> 01:46:20.417
My beloved teaching staff

01:46:21.292 --> 01:46:22.792
My dear children

01:46:23.500 --> 01:46:28.500
I wish to share a few things with you.

01:46:29.542 --> 01:46:31.709
As you might have noticed

01:46:31.959 --> 01:46:35.918
We got a new teacher here today.

01:46:37.375 --> 01:46:41.918
In place of our dearest Jolly teacher,

01:46:42.250 --> 01:46:44.459
We have Sony Sir now onwards.

01:46:45.876 --> 01:46:50.999
Let us welcome Sony Sir
to our school family...

01:46:51.459 --> 01:46:53.667
With wholehearted applause.

01:46:58.667 --> 01:47:05.083
'Salutations to you, O God of goodness'

01:47:05.375 --> 01:47:11.709
'Salutations to you, O God
who is the form of love'

01:47:12.042 --> 01:47:17.209
'Let intelligence, purity and
purity of character arise'

01:47:17.334 --> 01:47:22.959
'Give me devotion and wisdom,
O Merciful God'

01:47:23.167 --> 01:47:29.626
'Salutations to you, O God of goodness'

01:47:29.959 --> 01:47:33.751
'Salutations to you, O God who
is the form of love'
