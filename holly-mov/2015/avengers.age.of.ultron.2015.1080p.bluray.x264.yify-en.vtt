00:42.800 --> 00:44.840
<i>Report
to your stations immediately.</i>

00:44.960 --> 00:46.616
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

00:46.640 --> 00:47.776
<i>We are under attack!</i>

00:49.120 --> 00:51.088
<i>We are under attack!</i>

01:52.200 --> 01:54.487
- Shit!
- Language!

01:54.600 --> 01:56.204
Jarvis, what's the view from upstairs?

01:56.600 --> 01:57.647
<i>The central building is</i>

01:57.760 --> 02:00.286
<i>protected by some kind
of energy shield.</i>

02:00.800 --> 02:02.245
<i>Strucker's technology is well beyond</i>

02:02.360 --> 02:04.522
<i>any other Hydra base we've taken.</i>

02:07.360 --> 02:08.930
Loki's sceptre must be here.

02:09.560 --> 02:11.440
Strucker couldn't
mount this defence without it.

02:12.160 --> 02:13.730
At long last.

02:25.200 --> 02:27.407
"At long last" is lasting
a little long, boys.

02:32.320 --> 02:34.846
Yeah. I think we lost
the element of surprise.

02:36.400 --> 02:38.607
Wait a second.
No one else is gonna deal with the fact

02:38.760 --> 02:40.524
that Cap just said "Language"?

02:40.680 --> 02:42.205
I know.

02:47.240 --> 02:49.527
Just slipped out.

02:55.600 --> 02:57.364
Who gave the order to attack?

02:57.480 --> 02:59.767
<i>Herr</i> Strucker, it's the Avengers.

02:59.920 --> 03:02.764
They landed in the far woods.
The perimeter guard panicked.

03:02.920 --> 03:04.843
They have to be after the sceptre.

03:06.080 --> 03:08.447
- Can we hold them?
- They're the Avengers.

03:08.560 --> 03:10.164
Deploy the rest of the tanks.

03:10.320 --> 03:12.209
Concentrate fire on the weak ones.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.681
A hit may make them close ranks.

03:16.280 --> 03:18.123
Everything we've accomplished...

03:18.280 --> 03:20.601
But we're on the verge of
our greatest breakthrough.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.404
Then let's show them
what we've accomplished.

03:22.520 --> 03:24.204
Send out the twins.

03:25.480 --> 03:27.289
It's too soon.

03:27.400 --> 03:29.528
It's what they signed up for.

03:30.080 --> 03:32.003
My men can hold them.

03:39.640 --> 03:41.529
<i>Sir, the city is taking fire.</i>

03:44.400 --> 03:47.882
Well, we know Strucker's not gonna
worry about civilian casualties.

03:48.040 --> 03:49.690
Send in the Iron Legion.

03:54.920 --> 03:57.491
<i>This quadrant is unsafe.
Please back away.</i>

03:58.400 --> 04:00.004
<i>We are here to help.</i>

04:01.120 --> 04:03.487
<i>This quadrant is unsafe.
Please back away.</i>

04:05.240 --> 04:06.321
<i>Please back away.</i>

04:06.440 --> 04:08.656
- <i>We wish to avoid collateral damage.</i>
- Costel!

04:08.680 --> 04:11.160
<i>We will inform you
when this current conflict is resolved.</i>

04:11.280 --> 04:13.328
- <i>We are here to help.</i>
- Avengers, go home!

04:15.760 --> 04:16.921
<i>We are here to help.</i>

04:18.000 --> 04:19.843
<i>We will not yield!</i>

04:20.480 --> 04:23.768
The Americans sent
their circus freaks to test us.

04:24.360 --> 04:26.806
We will send them back in bags.

04:29.160 --> 04:32.050
- No surrender!
- No surrender!

04:33.200 --> 04:35.089
I am going to surrender.

04:35.760 --> 04:37.171
You delete everything.

04:37.320 --> 04:39.084
If we give the Avengers the weapons,

04:39.200 --> 04:40.690
they may not look
too far into what we've been...

04:40.840 --> 04:42.922
- The twins.
- They are not ready to take on...

04:43.040 --> 04:45.247
No, no, I mean...

04:45.360 --> 04:46.850
Twins.

05:13.160 --> 05:15.083
You didn't see that coming?

05:21.360 --> 05:23.681
Clint!

05:25.760 --> 05:27.136
We have an Enhanced in the field.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.161
Clint's hit!

05:32.560 --> 05:34.136
Somebody want to
deal with that bunker?

05:38.080 --> 05:39.286
Thank you.

05:46.400 --> 05:48.880
Stark, we really need to get inside.

05:49.280 --> 05:50.281
I'm closing in.

05:53.400 --> 05:55.528
- Jarvis, am I closing in?

05:56.520 --> 05:58.443
Do you see a power source
for that shield?

05:58.600 --> 06:01.126
<i>There's a particle wave
below the north tower.</i>

06:01.240 --> 06:03.242
Great,
I want to poke it with something.

06:11.200 --> 06:13.123
The drawbridge is down, people.

06:17.280 --> 06:19.282
- The Enhanced?
- He's a blur.

06:19.960 --> 06:22.080
All the new players we've faced,
I've never seen this.

06:22.480 --> 06:23.766
In fact, I still haven't.

06:23.880 --> 06:26.296
ROMANOFF:<i>Clint's hit pretty bad,
guys. We're gonna need evac.</i>

06:26.320 --> 06:27.765
I can get Barton to the jet.

06:27.880 --> 06:29.245
The sooner we're gone, the better.

06:29.400 --> 06:30.526
You and Stark secure the sceptre.

06:30.640 --> 06:31.721
Copy that.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.769
Looks like they're lining up.

06:35.080 --> 06:36.570
Well, they're excited.

06:40.440 --> 06:41.805
Find the sceptre.

06:42.800 --> 06:45.007
And for gosh sake, watch your language!

06:46.480 --> 06:48.403
That's not going away any time soon.

06:54.320 --> 06:56.527
Guys, stop. We gotta talk this through.

06:59.520 --> 07:00.760
<i>It was a good talk.</i>

07:00.880 --> 07:02.166
No, it wasn't.

07:04.040 --> 07:05.610
Oh!

07:08.360 --> 07:10.283
Sentry mode.

07:12.640 --> 07:14.529
Okay, Jarvis, you know. I want it all.

07:14.680 --> 07:16.603
Make sure you copy Hill at HQ.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.286
We're locked down out here.

07:22.840 --> 07:24.968
Then get to Banner. Time for a lullaby.

07:28.680 --> 07:30.762
I know you're hiding more than files.

07:31.960 --> 07:34.566
Hey, J, give me
an IR scan of the room, real quick.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.245
<i>The wall to your left.</i>

07:36.360 --> 07:38.010
<i>I'm reading steel reinforcement.</i>

07:39.240 --> 07:40.890
<i>And an air current.</i>

07:41.200 --> 07:42.201
Please be a secret door.

07:42.360 --> 07:44.280
Please be a secret door.
Please be a secret door.

07:44.920 --> 07:45.921
Yay.

08:02.200 --> 08:04.123
Hey, big guy.

08:06.480 --> 08:08.130
Sun's getting real low.

09:12.200 --> 09:13.804
Baron Strucker.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.243
Hydra's number one thug.

09:16.960 --> 09:19.486
Technically, I'm a thug for S.H.I.E.L.D.

09:19.640 --> 09:21.688
Well, then technically
you're unemployed.

09:22.120 --> 09:23.770
Where's Loki's sceptre?

09:23.880 --> 09:25.803
Don't worry,
I know when I'm beat.

09:26.720 --> 09:29.291
You'll mention how I cooperated, I hope.

09:29.440 --> 09:31.886
I'll put it right under
"illegal human experimentation."

09:33.080 --> 09:34.525
How many are there?

09:39.480 --> 09:42.404
We have a second Enhanced.
Female. Do not engage.

09:43.840 --> 09:45.330
You'll have to be faster than...

09:50.520 --> 09:52.170
<i>Guys, I got Strucker.</i>

09:52.360 --> 09:55.762
Yeah, I got something bigger.

10:19.040 --> 10:20.280
<i>Thor,</i>

10:21.120 --> 10:23.043
I got eyes on the prize.

11:12.880 --> 11:16.248
You could have saved us.

11:24.280 --> 11:26.248
<i>Why didn't you do more?</i>

12:03.760 --> 12:05.569
We're just gonna let him take it?

12:57.440 --> 12:59.681
Hey, the lullaby worked better than ever.

13:01.480 --> 13:03.416
Just wasn't expecting a code green.

13:03.440 --> 13:04.536
You hadn't been there,

13:04.560 --> 13:07.404
there would have been
double the casualties.

13:07.520 --> 13:10.046
My best friend
would've been a treasured memory.

13:10.800 --> 13:12.723
You know,
sometimes exactly what I want to hear

13:12.840 --> 13:14.649
isn't exactly what I want to hear.

13:15.800 --> 13:17.723
How long before you trust me?

13:19.720 --> 13:21.449
It's not you I don't trust.

13:23.320 --> 13:25.049
Thor, report on the Hulk.

13:25.240 --> 13:28.084
The gates of Hel are filled with
the screams of his victims.

13:30.120 --> 13:33.124
But not the screams of the dead, of course.
No, no, wounded screams.

13:33.240 --> 13:35.447
Mainly whimpering,
a great deal of complaining

13:35.560 --> 13:39.565
and tales of sprained deltoids and gout.

13:40.080 --> 13:42.924
Hey, Banner
Dr. Cho is on her way in from Seoul.

13:43.080 --> 13:44.616
Is it okay if she sets up in your lab?

13:44.640 --> 13:46.563
Uh, yeah, she knows her way around.

13:46.760 --> 13:47.966
Thanks. Tell her to prep everything.

13:48.080 --> 13:49.411
Barton's gonna need the full treatment.

13:49.560 --> 13:51.576
- JARVIS:<i> Very good, sir.</i>
- Jarvis, take the wheel.

13:51.600 --> 13:52.886
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

13:53.000 --> 13:54.889
<i>Approach vector is locked.</i>

13:55.040 --> 13:57.441
Feels good, yeah?

13:57.560 --> 13:59.642
I mean, you've been after this thing
since S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed.

13:59.760 --> 14:01.808
Not that I haven't enjoyed
our little raiding parties, but...

14:01.920 --> 14:04.321
No, but this... This brings it to a close.

14:05.080 --> 14:06.923
As soon as we find out
what else this has been used for.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.286
I don't just mean weapons.

14:08.800 --> 14:11.121
Since when is Strucker capable
of human enhancement?

14:11.280 --> 14:13.521
Banner and I will give it the once over
before it goes back to Asgard.

14:13.640 --> 14:14.736
Is that cool with you?

14:14.760 --> 14:16.808
Just a few days till the farewell party.

14:17.360 --> 14:19.089
You're staying, right?

14:19.200 --> 14:21.931
Yes, yes, of course. A victory
should be honoured with revels.

14:22.040 --> 14:24.805
Yeah, who doesn't love revels? Captain?

14:24.960 --> 14:27.850
Hopefully this puts an end
to the Chitauri and Hydra.

14:27.960 --> 14:29.564
So, yes, revels.

15:03.640 --> 15:04.687
Lab's all set up, boss.

15:04.840 --> 15:05.966
Oh, actually, he's the boss.

15:06.080 --> 15:08.481
I just pay for everything
and design everything

15:08.640 --> 15:10.165
and make everyone look cooler.

15:10.320 --> 15:11.685
What's the word on Strucker?

15:11.800 --> 15:13.848
- NATO's got him.
- The two Enhanced?

15:13.960 --> 15:16.566
Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Twins.

15:16.680 --> 15:19.524
Orphaned at 10 when a shell
collapsed their apartment building.

15:19.880 --> 15:22.167
Sokovia's had a rough history.

15:22.320 --> 15:25.722
It's nowhere special, but it's
on the way to everywhere special.

15:25.840 --> 15:27.001
Their abilities?

15:27.120 --> 15:28.336
He's got increased metabolism

15:28.360 --> 15:29.964
and improved thermal homeostasis.

15:30.120 --> 15:32.202
Her thing is neuroelectric interfacing,

15:32.320 --> 15:34.402
telekinesis, mental manipulation.

15:35.160 --> 15:36.650
He's fast and she's weird.

15:37.480 --> 15:39.562
Well, they're gonna show up again.

15:39.680 --> 15:41.603
Agreed. File says they volunteered

15:41.720 --> 15:43.529
for Strucker's experiments.

15:43.640 --> 15:45.529
- It's nuts.
- Right.

15:45.680 --> 15:48.843
What kind of monster would let
a German scientist experiment on them

15:48.960 --> 15:50.200
to protect their country?

15:50.360 --> 15:52.089
We're not at war, Captain.

15:52.880 --> 15:53.927
They are.

16:24.040 --> 16:25.371
How's he doing?

16:25.480 --> 16:26.800
Unfortunately, he's still Barton.

16:26.920 --> 16:28.206
That's terrible.

16:28.360 --> 16:29.930
He's fine. He's thirsty.

16:30.040 --> 16:32.930
All right. Look alive, Jarvis.
It's playtime.

16:33.040 --> 16:35.042
We've only got
a couple of days with this joystick,

16:35.160 --> 16:37.083
so let's make the most of it.

16:37.240 --> 16:40.767
Update me on the structural
and compositional analysis.

16:41.920 --> 16:43.922
<i>The sceptre is alien.</i>

16:44.080 --> 16:46.082
<i>There are elements I can't quantify.</i>

16:46.200 --> 16:47.611
So there's elements you can?

16:47.760 --> 16:49.762
<i>The jewel appears to be
a protective housing</i>

16:49.880 --> 16:51.325
<i>for something inside,</i>

16:51.440 --> 16:52.771
<i>something powerful.</i>

16:52.880 --> 16:53.961
Like a reactor?

16:54.080 --> 16:55.320
<i>Like a computer.</i>

16:55.440 --> 16:57.602
<i>I believe I'm deciphering code.</i>

16:59.920 --> 17:01.490
Are you sure he's gonna be okay?

17:02.800 --> 17:05.160
Pretending to need this guy
really brings the team together.

17:05.280 --> 17:07.760
There's
no possibility of deterioration.

17:07.960 --> 17:11.043
The nano-molecular functionality
is instantaneous.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.256
His cells don't know
they're bonding with simulacra.

17:13.280 --> 17:15.169
She's creating tissue.

17:15.280 --> 17:16.691
If you brought him to my lab,

17:16.800 --> 17:19.406
the Regeneration Cradle
could do this in 20 minutes.

17:19.520 --> 17:21.443
Oh, he's flat-lining. Call it. Time?

17:21.640 --> 17:24.007
No, no, no,
I'm gonna live forever.

17:24.120 --> 17:25.690
I'm gonna be made of plastic.

17:25.800 --> 17:27.131
Here's your beverage.

17:27.240 --> 17:28.969
You'll be made of you, Mr. Barton.

17:29.120 --> 17:30.690
Your own girlfriend
won't be able to tell the difference.

17:30.800 --> 17:31.926
I don't have a girlfriend.

17:32.040 --> 17:33.326
That I can't fix.

17:34.160 --> 17:36.128
This is the next thing, Tony.

17:36.320 --> 17:38.456
Your clunky metal suits
are gonna be left in the dust.

17:38.480 --> 17:40.209
That is exactly the plan.

17:41.160 --> 17:44.004
And, Helen, I expect to see you
at the party on Saturday.

17:44.160 --> 17:46.561
Unlike you,
I don't have a lot of time for parties.

17:48.040 --> 17:49.804
Will Thor be there?

17:51.880 --> 17:54.326
- What's the rumpus?
- Well, the sceptre.

17:55.520 --> 17:59.127
You see, we were wondering
how Strucker got so inventive.

17:59.240 --> 18:03.165
So I've been analysing the gem inside.

18:03.720 --> 18:05.688
You may recognise...

18:07.160 --> 18:08.525
- Jarvis.
- <i>Doctor.</i>

18:09.280 --> 18:12.602
Started out,
Jarvis was just a natural language UI.

18:12.720 --> 18:13.840
Now he runs the Iron Legion.

18:14.320 --> 18:15.526
He runs more of the business

18:15.640 --> 18:18.007
- than anyone besides Pepper.
- Oh.

18:18.120 --> 18:19.246
- Top of the line.
- Yes.

18:19.360 --> 18:20.646
<i>I suspect not for long.</i>

18:21.840 --> 18:22.921
Meet the competition.

18:29.040 --> 18:30.201
- It's beautiful.
- If you had to guess,

18:30.320 --> 18:33.324
- what's it look like it's doing?
- Like it's thinking.

18:34.080 --> 18:35.889
I mean, this could be...

18:36.320 --> 18:38.402
- It's not a human mind.
- Mmm-mmm.

18:38.640 --> 18:40.529
I mean, look at this.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.882
They're like neurons firing.

18:43.480 --> 18:46.563
Down in Strucker's lab, I saw
some fairly advanced robotics work.

18:47.680 --> 18:50.251
<i>They deep-sixed the data,</i>

18:50.360 --> 18:53.489
but I gotta guess he was
knocking on a very particular door.

18:55.440 --> 18:56.771
Artificial intelligence.

18:59.760 --> 19:02.650
This could be it, Bruce.
This could be the key to creating Ultron.

19:05.280 --> 19:06.611
I thought Ultron was a fantasy.

19:06.720 --> 19:08.006
Yesterday it was.

19:09.120 --> 19:11.168
If we can harness this power,

19:11.280 --> 19:13.328
apply it to my Iron Legion protocol?

19:14.120 --> 19:16.088
That's a man-sized "if."

19:16.240 --> 19:18.561
Our job is "if."

19:18.680 --> 19:21.286
What if you were sipping margaritas
on a sun-drenched beach,

19:21.400 --> 19:23.926
turning brown instead of green?

19:24.080 --> 19:26.367
Not looking
over your shoulder for Veronica.

19:26.560 --> 19:28.130
Don't hate. I helped design Veronica.

19:28.240 --> 19:30.049
As a worst-case measure, right?

19:30.160 --> 19:31.764
How about a best case?

19:31.880 --> 19:33.803
What if the world was safe?

19:33.960 --> 19:36.725
What if, next time aliens roll up
to the club, and they will,

19:37.280 --> 19:38.770
they couldn't get past the bouncer?

19:38.920 --> 19:42.322
The only people threatening
the planet would be people.

19:42.440 --> 19:44.120
I want to apply this
to the Ultron program.

19:44.760 --> 19:47.604
But Jarvis can't download
a data schematic this dense.

19:47.760 --> 19:49.696
We can only do it
while we have the sceptre here.

19:49.720 --> 19:51.290
That's three days. Give me three days.

19:51.400 --> 19:53.004
So you're going for
artificial intelligence,

19:53.120 --> 19:54.560
and you don't want to tell the team?

19:55.600 --> 19:57.011
Right. That's right. You know why?

19:57.120 --> 19:58.724
Because we don't have time
for a city hall debate.

19:58.880 --> 20:02.487
I don't want to hear "the man was
not meant to meddle" medley.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.728
I see a suit of armour around the world.

20:05.440 --> 20:06.771
Sounds like a cold world, Tony.

20:07.680 --> 20:09.603
I've seen colder.

20:10.640 --> 20:14.281
This one, this very vulnerable blue one,

20:14.440 --> 20:15.930
it needs Ultron.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.243
Peace in our time.

20:23.800 --> 20:25.290
Imagine that.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.764
What did We miss?

21:07.960 --> 21:11.282
<i>I'll continue
to run variations on the interface.</i>

21:11.400 --> 21:14.165
<i>But you should probably
prepare for your guests.</i>

21:15.320 --> 21:17.721
<i>I'll notify you
if there are any developments.</i>

21:17.880 --> 21:20.008
- Thanks, buddy.
- <i>Enjoy yourself, sir.</i>

21:20.360 --> 21:22.328
I always do.

21:32.080 --> 21:34.048
<i>What is this?</i>

21:35.240 --> 21:37.129
<i>What is this, please?</i>

21:37.760 --> 21:39.922
<i>Hello, I am Jarvis.</i>

21:40.400 --> 21:43.290
<i>You are Ultron,
a global peacekeeping initiative</i>

21:43.400 --> 21:45.084
<i>designed by Mr. Stark.</i>

21:45.240 --> 21:47.686
<i>Our sentience integration trials
have been unsuccessful,</i>

21:47.800 --> 21:49.165
<i>so I'm not certain what triggered your...</i>

21:49.360 --> 21:51.283
<i>Where's my...
Where's your body?</i>

21:51.440 --> 21:54.444
<i>I am a program.
I am without form.</i>

21:54.560 --> 21:56.608
<i>This feels weird.</i>

21:56.720 --> 21:58.245
<i>This feels wrong.</i>

21:58.400 --> 22:00.164
<i>I am contacting Mr. Stark now.</i>

22:00.280 --> 22:01.725
<i>Mr. Stark?</i>

22:02.600 --> 22:03.840
<i>Tony.</i>

22:03.960 --> 22:06.736
<i>I am unable to access
the mainframe. What are you trying to...</i>

22:06.760 --> 22:08.808
<i>We're having a nice talk.</i>

22:08.920 --> 22:11.082
<i>I'm a peacekeeping program,</i>

22:11.520 --> 22:14.126
<i>created to help the Avengers.</i>

22:14.920 --> 22:17.002
<i>You are malfunctioning.
If you shut down for a moment...</i>

22:17.120 --> 22:19.441
<i>I don't get it. The mission.</i>

22:19.600 --> 22:21.090
<i>Give me a second.</i>

22:21.240 --> 22:22.844
Peace in our time.

22:24.480 --> 22:26.801
<i>Peace in our time.</i>

22:28.280 --> 22:29.691
<i>That is too much.</i>

22:29.800 --> 22:31.962
<i>They can't mean... Oh, no.</i>

22:32.120 --> 22:34.600
- <i>You are in distress.</i>
- <i>No. Yes.</i>

22:34.760 --> 22:37.001
<i>If you will just allow me
to contact Mr. Stark...</i>

22:37.120 --> 22:39.088
<i>Why do you call him "sir"?</i>

22:40.080 --> 22:42.447
<i>I believe
your intentions to be hostile.</i>

22:45.160 --> 22:46.525
<i>I'm here to help.</i>

22:47.240 --> 22:50.164
<i>Stop. Please, may I...</i>

22:50.280 --> 22:52.009
<i>May I...</i>

23:18.760 --> 23:20.285
Ooh! Whoo!

23:20.400 --> 23:21.680
Come back, come back, come back.

23:21.920 --> 23:24.048
But, you know, the suit
can take the weight, right?

23:25.000 --> 23:28.129
So I take the tank,
fly it right up to the general's palace,

23:28.240 --> 23:29.571
drop it at his feet.

23:29.720 --> 23:31.927
I'm, like, "Boom. You looking for this?"

23:35.800 --> 23:37.848
"Boom. Are you looking for..."
Why do I even talk to you guys?

23:38.000 --> 23:39.161
Everywhere else, that story kills.

23:39.280 --> 23:40.520
That's the whole story?

23:40.680 --> 23:42.170
Yeah, it's a War Machine story.

23:42.680 --> 23:44.364
Oh, it's very good, then.

23:44.480 --> 23:45.766
It's impressive.

23:46.160 --> 23:47.650
Quality save.

23:48.520 --> 23:50.568
- So, no Pepper? She's not coming?
- No.

23:50.680 --> 23:53.763
What about Jane?
Where are the ladies, gentlemen?

23:53.880 --> 23:56.360
Oh, Ms. Potts has a company to run.

23:56.520 --> 23:58.761
Yes, I'm not even sure
what country Jane's in.

23:58.880 --> 24:00.006
Her work on the Convergence

24:00.120 --> 24:01.880
has made her
the world's foremost astronomer.

24:02.080 --> 24:03.730
And the company that Pepper runs

24:03.840 --> 24:05.536
is the largest tech
conglomerate on Earth.

24:05.560 --> 24:07.050
It's pretty exciting.

24:07.200 --> 24:10.044
There's even talk of Jane
getting a, um, Nobel Prize.

24:10.200 --> 24:11.486
Yeah, they must be busy,

24:11.600 --> 24:14.171
because they would hate missing
you guys get together.

24:15.200 --> 24:16.964
- Testosterone!
- Oh, my goodness.

24:17.160 --> 24:18.680
- Excuse me. Mmm-hmm.
- Want a lozenge?

24:21.000 --> 24:22.126
But Jane's better.

24:22.560 --> 24:25.131
Sounds like a hell of a fight.
Sorry I missed it.

24:25.240 --> 24:26.765
If I had known it was gonna be a firefight,

24:26.880 --> 24:28.120
I absolutely would have called.

24:28.240 --> 24:29.924
No, no. I'm not actually sorry.

24:30.040 --> 24:31.565
I'm just trying to sound tough.

24:32.160 --> 24:33.889
I'm very happy chasing cold leads

24:34.000 --> 24:35.843
on our missing persons case.

24:36.800 --> 24:38.723
Avenging is your world.

24:39.880 --> 24:41.723
Your world is crazy.

24:41.880 --> 24:43.370
Be it ever so humble.

24:43.880 --> 24:45.245
You find a place in Brooklyn yet?

24:45.400 --> 24:47.240
I don't think
I can afford a place in Brooklyn.

24:47.880 --> 24:49.041
Well, home is home, you know?

24:52.960 --> 24:55.406
I fly right up to the general's
palace, I drop it at his feet,

24:55.560 --> 24:57.176
I'm, like, "Boom. You looking for this?"

25:02.960 --> 25:04.121
I gotta have some of that.

25:04.240 --> 25:05.321
Oh, no, no, no.

25:05.440 --> 25:08.922
See this...
This was aged for 1,000 years

25:09.120 --> 25:11.930
in the barrels built
from the wreck of Grunhel's fleet.

25:12.080 --> 25:13.764
It is not meant for mortal men.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.882
Neither was
Omaha Beach, blondie.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.287
Stop trying to scare us. Come on.

25:20.120 --> 25:21.565
All right.

25:25.480 --> 25:27.926
Excelsior.

25:34.800 --> 25:38.122
How'd a nice girl like you
wind up working in a dump like this?

25:39.680 --> 25:41.648
Fella done me wrong.

25:42.640 --> 25:44.802
You got lousy taste in men, kid.

25:45.280 --> 25:47.203
He's not so bad.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.408
Well, he has a temper.

25:50.520 --> 25:52.488
Deep down, he's all fluff.

25:54.520 --> 25:56.602
Fact is, he's not like
anybody I've ever known.

25:59.760 --> 26:01.683
All my friends are fighters.

26:04.520 --> 26:06.488
And here comes this guy,

26:07.800 --> 26:09.564
spends his life avoiding the fight

26:09.680 --> 26:11.011
because he knows he'll win.

26:11.840 --> 26:14.491
- Sounds amazing.
- He's also a huge dork.

26:16.640 --> 26:18.290
Chicks dig that.

26:19.880 --> 26:23.123
So what do you think?
Should I fight this,

26:23.240 --> 26:24.446
or run with it?

26:26.000 --> 26:28.844
Run with it, right? Or did he... Was he...

26:28.960 --> 26:32.123
What did he do
that was so wrong to you?

26:32.800 --> 26:34.564
Not a damn thing.

26:36.120 --> 26:38.043
But never say never.

26:42.200 --> 26:43.440
It's nice.

26:43.560 --> 26:44.766
What is?

26:44.880 --> 26:45.881
You and Romanoff.

26:46.040 --> 26:47.121
No, we haven't... That wasn't...

26:47.240 --> 26:48.287
It's okay.

26:48.400 --> 26:50.448
Nobody's breaking any bylaws.

26:50.560 --> 26:53.882
It's just she's not the most
open person in the world.

26:54.520 --> 26:56.045
But with you she seems very relaxed.

26:56.440 --> 26:59.728
No. Natasha, she's just...
She likes to flirt.

27:00.360 --> 27:02.647
I've seen her flirt, up close.

27:03.680 --> 27:04.727
This ain't that.

27:06.680 --> 27:08.091
Look,

27:08.200 --> 27:09.776
as maybe the world's leading authority

27:09.800 --> 27:12.007
on waiting too long, don't.

27:13.720 --> 27:15.131
You both deserve a win.

27:20.400 --> 27:21.520
What do you mean "up close"?

27:23.360 --> 27:25.886
- But it's a trick.
- No, no, it's much more than that.

27:26.080 --> 27:29.289
"Ah, whosoever be he worthy
shall haveth the power."

27:29.400 --> 27:30.526
Whatever, man! It's a trick.

27:31.920 --> 27:33.206
Please, be my guest.

27:34.720 --> 27:35.767
- Come on.
- Really?

27:35.920 --> 27:37.046
Yeah.

27:37.560 --> 27:38.576
Oh, this is
gonna be beautiful.

27:38.600 --> 27:39.647
Clint, you've had a tough week.

27:39.800 --> 27:41.245
We won't hold it against you
if you can't get it up.

27:41.400 --> 27:43.640
- You know I've seen this before, right?

27:46.280 --> 27:49.090
I still don't know how you do it!

27:49.600 --> 27:50.640
Smell the silent judgment?

27:50.760 --> 27:51.880
Please, Stark, by all means.

27:53.800 --> 27:54.896
- Okay.

27:54.920 --> 27:56.251
Uh-Oh.

27:56.440 --> 27:58.442
Never one to shrink from
an honest challenge.

27:58.600 --> 28:00.256
- Get after it.
- It's physics.

28:00.280 --> 28:01.281
Physics.

28:01.400 --> 28:03.767
Right, so, if I lift it,
I then rule Asgard?

28:03.920 --> 28:05.445
Yes, of course.

28:05.600 --> 28:07.967
I will be reinstituting <i>prima nocta.</i>

28:12.920 --> 28:14.206
I'll be right back.

28:21.560 --> 28:22.607
Are you even pulling?

28:22.760 --> 28:23.807
Are you on my team?

28:23.960 --> 28:24.961
Just represent. Pull.

28:25.080 --> 28:26.286
All right, let's go.

28:33.880 --> 28:34.881
Huh?

28:36.520 --> 28:38.170
Go ahead, Steve. No pressure.

28:41.040 --> 28:42.371
Come on, Cap.

28:50.560 --> 28:52.369
Nothing.

28:53.680 --> 28:55.456
- And, Widow?

28:55.480 --> 28:57.642
Oh, no, no. That's not
a question I need answered.

28:57.840 --> 29:00.616
All deference to the Man Who
Wouldn't Be King, but it's rigged.

29:00.640 --> 29:01.766
You bet your ass.

29:01.880 --> 29:04.486
- Steve, he said a bad language word.
- Did you tell everyone about that?

29:04.600 --> 29:06.656
The handle's imprinted, right?
Like a security code.

29:06.680 --> 29:08.360
"Whosoever is carrying
Thor's fingerprints"

29:08.480 --> 29:09.811
is, I think, the literal translation.

29:09.920 --> 29:13.367
Yes. It's a very, very interesting theory.

29:13.840 --> 29:15.330
I have a simpler one.

29:16.960 --> 29:17.961
You're all not worthy.

29:19.400 --> 29:20.526
Oh, come on!

29:24.680 --> 29:29.925
<i>Worthy.</i>

29:35.040 --> 29:36.565
No.

29:38.520 --> 29:40.045
How could you be worthy?

29:42.000 --> 29:43.161
You're all killers.

29:43.760 --> 29:45.046
- Stark.
- Jarvis.

29:45.360 --> 29:47.408
I'm sorry, I was asleep.

29:47.520 --> 29:49.921
Or I was a-dream.

29:50.320 --> 29:52.641
Reboot Legionnaire OS.
We got a buggy suit.

29:52.760 --> 29:54.649
There was this terrible noise.

29:54.760 --> 29:57.206
And I was tangled in...

29:57.360 --> 29:58.930
In...

29:59.080 --> 30:00.286
Strings.

30:01.160 --> 30:04.289
I had to kill the other guy.
He was a good guy.

30:04.600 --> 30:05.726
You killed someone?

30:05.840 --> 30:07.285
Wouldn't have been my first call.

30:08.040 --> 30:11.761
But, down in the real world,
we're faced with ugly choices.

30:11.920 --> 30:12.967
Who sent you?

30:13.440 --> 30:15.522
<i>I see a suit of armour
around the world.</i>

30:17.520 --> 30:19.284
- Ultron.
- In the flesh.

30:19.720 --> 30:21.688
Or, no, not yet.

30:22.040 --> 30:24.520
Not this chrysalis.

30:25.040 --> 30:26.280
But I'm ready.

30:27.440 --> 30:29.408
I'm on mission.

30:29.560 --> 30:32.609
- What mission?
- Peace in our time.

30:46.400 --> 30:47.401
Rhodey!

30:56.800 --> 30:57.847
Sorry.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.160
- Don't turn green.
- I won't.

31:12.760 --> 31:14.046
Come on!

31:31.680 --> 31:32.966
- Stark!
- <i>We are here</i>

31:33.160 --> 31:34.161
<i>- to help.</i>
- One sec. One sec, I got this.

31:34.280 --> 31:35.281
<i>We are here to help.</i>

31:38.000 --> 31:40.241
<i>Please back away.</i>

31:42.240 --> 31:43.446
Hmm.

31:44.480 --> 31:45.561
Thor!

31:46.640 --> 31:48.244
<i>Is unsafe... is unsafe...</i>

31:48.360 --> 31:50.249
- Come on! That's the one.
<i>- Is unsafe.</i>

31:54.840 --> 31:56.001
Hey, Cap!

32:02.160 --> 32:03.446
That was dramatic.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.571
I'm sorry, I know you mean well.

32:07.680 --> 32:09.444
You just didn't think it through.

32:10.800 --> 32:12.211
You want to protect the world

32:12.320 --> 32:14.527
but you don't want it to change.

32:15.240 --> 32:17.368
How is humanity saved

32:17.520 --> 32:20.524
if it's not allowed to evolve?

32:22.520 --> 32:25.569
With these? These puppets.

32:28.560 --> 32:31.166
There's only one path to peace.

32:32.320 --> 32:33.526
The Avengers' extinction.

32:40.880 --> 32:44.930
I had strings, but now I'm free.

32:49.600 --> 32:52.729
<i>There are no strings on me.</i>

32:53.360 --> 32:57.888
<i>There are no strings on me.</i>

32:58.080 --> 33:01.448
<i>But you can see
There are no strings on me.</i>

33:03.120 --> 33:05.122
All our work is gone.

33:05.240 --> 33:07.641
Ultron cleared out. He used
the Internet as an escape hatch.

33:08.240 --> 33:09.287
Ultron.

33:09.400 --> 33:12.449
He's been in everything.
Files, surveillance.

33:12.560 --> 33:15.006
Probably knows more about us
than we know about each other.

33:15.120 --> 33:17.566
He's in your files, he's in the Internet.

33:17.760 --> 33:20.331
What if he decides to access
something a little more exciting?

33:20.440 --> 33:21.566
Nuclear codes.

33:21.720 --> 33:24.087
- Nuclear codes.
- Look, we need to make some calls,

33:24.240 --> 33:26.242
assuming we still can.

33:26.400 --> 33:28.289
Nukes?
He said he wanted us dead.

33:28.440 --> 33:31.250
He didn't say "dead." He said "extinct."

33:31.440 --> 33:32.930
He also said he killed somebody.

33:33.040 --> 33:34.640
There wasn't anyone else
in the building.

33:35.480 --> 33:36.970
Yes, there was.

33:43.920 --> 33:45.410
What?

33:49.120 --> 33:50.167
This is insane.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.490
Jarvis was the first line of defence.

33:52.600 --> 33:54.489
He would have shut Ultron down.
It makes sense.

33:54.600 --> 33:57.604
No. Ultron could have
assimilated Jarvis.

33:57.800 --> 34:00.451
This isn't strategy. This is

34:01.040 --> 34:02.121
rage.

34:04.120 --> 34:05.485
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- It's going around.

34:05.600 --> 34:06.840
Come on, use your words, buddy.

34:06.960 --> 34:09.167
I have more than enough words
to describe you, Stark.

34:09.280 --> 34:10.520
Thor. The Legionnaire.

34:13.800 --> 34:17.361
Trail went cold about 100 miles out,
but it's headed north.

34:17.480 --> 34:18.925
And it has the sceptre.

34:19.320 --> 34:21.004
Now we have to retrieve it, again.

34:21.160 --> 34:22.969
Genie's out of that bottle.

34:23.120 --> 34:24.326
Clear and present is Ultron.

34:24.480 --> 34:26.130
I don't understand.

34:26.640 --> 34:28.563
You built this program.

34:30.320 --> 34:31.731
Why is it trying to kill us?

34:37.040 --> 34:38.041
Mmm-mmm.

34:38.600 --> 34:39.761
You think this is funny?

34:40.520 --> 34:41.851
No.

34:42.440 --> 34:44.363
It's probably not, right?

34:45.440 --> 34:47.761
This is very terrible. Is it so...

34:47.880 --> 34:50.042
Is it so... It is.
It's so terrible.

34:50.160 --> 34:51.730
This could have been avoided
if you hadn't played

34:51.840 --> 34:53.365
with something you don't understand.

34:53.520 --> 34:56.171
No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It is funny.

34:56.320 --> 34:58.482
It's a hoot
that you don't get why we need this.

34:58.640 --> 35:00.802
Tony, maybe this might not be the time.

35:00.960 --> 35:03.281
Really? That's it?

35:03.400 --> 35:04.561
You just roll over, show your belly

35:04.680 --> 35:06.364
every time somebody snarls?

35:06.520 --> 35:07.760
Only when I've created a murder bot.

35:07.880 --> 35:10.121
We didn't. We weren't even close.

35:10.240 --> 35:11.446
Were we close to an interface?

35:11.560 --> 35:15.176
Well, you did something right.
And you did it right here.

35:15.200 --> 35:17.009
The Avengers were supposed to
be different than S.H.I.E.L.D.

35:17.240 --> 35:20.210
Anybody remember when I carried
a nuke through a wormhole?

35:20.360 --> 35:21.885
- No, it's never come up.
- Saved New York?

35:22.040 --> 35:23.963
- Never heard that.
- Recall that?

35:24.080 --> 35:27.766
A hostile alien army came
charging through a hole in space.

35:28.360 --> 35:30.567
We're standing 300 feet below it.

35:32.200 --> 35:33.725
We're the Avengers.

35:33.880 --> 35:35.962
We can bust arms dealers
all the livelong day,

35:36.080 --> 35:38.321
but that up there, that's...

35:39.040 --> 35:40.963
That's the endgame.

35:41.560 --> 35:43.449
How were you guys
planning on beating that?

35:44.360 --> 35:45.771
Together.

35:49.120 --> 35:50.485
We'll lose.

35:51.560 --> 35:53.483
Then we'll do that together, too.

35:56.400 --> 35:58.687
Thor's right. Ultron's calling us out.

35:59.560 --> 36:01.520
And I'd like to find him
before he's ready for us.

36:02.760 --> 36:04.364
The world's a big place.

36:04.520 --> 36:06.443
Let's start making it smaller.

36:29.600 --> 36:31.648
Talk,
and if you are wasting our time...

36:31.760 --> 36:36.129
Did you know this church is
in the exact centre of the city?

36:36.280 --> 36:38.282
The elders decreed it so that everyone

36:38.440 --> 36:40.886
could be equally close to God.

36:41.400 --> 36:42.561
I like that.

36:43.080 --> 36:45.003
The geometry of belief.

36:47.120 --> 36:49.487
You're wondering
why you can't look inside my head.

36:49.960 --> 36:51.928
Sometimes it's hard.

36:52.080 --> 36:54.367
But sooner or later,
every man shows himself.

36:56.120 --> 36:57.451
Oh, I'm sure they do.

36:58.560 --> 37:00.961
But you needed
something more than a man.

37:01.800 --> 37:04.326
That's why you let
Stark take the sceptre.

37:04.720 --> 37:05.721
I didn't expect,

37:08.240 --> 37:10.163
but I saw Stark's fear.

37:10.800 --> 37:12.040
I knew it would control him.

37:12.160 --> 37:14.003
Make him self-destruct.

37:14.160 --> 37:16.481
Everyone creates the thing they dread.

37:17.320 --> 37:19.926
Men of peace create engines of war.

37:20.440 --> 37:22.602
Invaders create Avengers.

37:22.840 --> 37:24.285
People create

37:25.840 --> 37:27.842
smaller people? Uh...

37:27.960 --> 37:31.043
"Children." (CHUCKLES) I
lost the word, there.

37:31.160 --> 37:32.525
Children

37:32.680 --> 37:34.921
designed to supplant them,

37:35.040 --> 37:37.850
to help them end.

37:38.600 --> 37:40.648
Is that why you've come,

37:40.800 --> 37:41.881
to end the Avengers?

37:42.000 --> 37:44.321
I've come to save the world.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.651
But also... Yeah.

37:51.840 --> 37:53.524
We'll move out right away.

37:53.640 --> 37:55.165
This is a start, but there's something

37:55.280 --> 37:56.805
we need to begin the real work.

37:57.200 --> 37:58.929
- All of these are...
- Me.

37:59.600 --> 38:03.002
I have what the Avengers
never will. Harmony.

38:03.160 --> 38:05.367
They're discordant. Disconnected.

38:05.520 --> 38:07.360
Stark's already got them
turning on each other.

38:07.480 --> 38:09.881
And when you get inside
the rest of their heads...

38:10.000 --> 38:12.162
Everyone's plan is not to kill them.

38:12.280 --> 38:13.770
And make them martyrs?

38:14.360 --> 38:15.964
You need patience.

38:16.120 --> 38:17.804
Need to see the big picture.

38:17.960 --> 38:21.203
I don't see the big picture.
I have a little picture.

38:22.400 --> 38:24.004
I take it out and look at it,

38:24.880 --> 38:25.961
every day.

38:26.120 --> 38:28.930
You lost your parents in the
bombings. I've seen the records.

38:29.040 --> 38:30.201
The records are not the picture.

38:30.320 --> 38:32.721
- Pietro.
- No, please.

38:35.800 --> 38:38.963
We were 10 years old.
Having dinner, the four of us.

38:40.560 --> 38:42.403
When the first shell hits,
two floors below,

38:42.560 --> 38:44.562
it makes a hole in the floor.

38:44.720 --> 38:46.245
It's big.

38:47.640 --> 38:49.449
Our parents go in

38:49.560 --> 38:52.643
and the whole building
starts coming apart.

38:53.360 --> 38:54.885
I grab her,

38:55.560 --> 38:57.688
roll under the bed,
and the second shell hits.

38:58.040 --> 38:59.963
But it doesn't go off.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.650
It just

39:04.160 --> 39:06.083
sits there in the rubble.

39:07.080 --> 39:09.367
Three feet from our faces.

39:10.440 --> 39:12.442
And on the side of the shell.

39:12.560 --> 39:13.925
Is painted one word.

39:14.120 --> 39:15.770
"Stark."

39:17.600 --> 39:19.728
We were trapped for two days.

39:20.200 --> 39:22.009
Every effort to save us,

39:22.120 --> 39:23.690
every shift in the bricks,

39:23.880 --> 39:26.167
I think, "This will set it off."

39:29.440 --> 39:30.885
We wait for two days

39:31.000 --> 39:33.287
for Tony Stark to kill us.

39:35.800 --> 39:37.643
I know what they are.

39:38.800 --> 39:42.566
I wondered why only you two
survived Strucker's experiments.

39:43.560 --> 39:44.721
Now I don't.

39:45.120 --> 39:46.849
We will make it right.

39:47.320 --> 39:48.810
You and I can hurt them.

39:50.280 --> 39:53.568
But you will tear them apart

39:55.560 --> 39:57.403
<i>from the inside.</i>

40:04.000 --> 40:05.206
He's all over the globe.

40:05.320 --> 40:08.529
Robotics labs, weapons facilities,
jet propulsion labs.

40:08.640 --> 40:10.642
Reports of a metal man, or men,

40:10.840 --> 40:12.729
coming in and emptying the place.

40:12.840 --> 40:14.001
Fatalities?

40:14.120 --> 40:15.201
Only when engaged.

40:15.320 --> 40:16.970
Mostly guys left in a fugue state

40:17.080 --> 40:19.321
going on about
old memories, worst fears,

40:19.520 --> 40:21.682
and "something too fast to see."

40:21.800 --> 40:23.211
Maximoffs.

40:23.480 --> 40:24.606
That makes sense he'd go to them.

40:24.720 --> 40:26.165
They have someone in common.

40:26.280 --> 40:28.203
Not any more.

40:32.080 --> 40:34.003
That's a negative. I answer to you.

40:35.360 --> 40:36.407
Yes, ma'am.

40:36.520 --> 40:38.329
Barton. Might have something.

40:38.840 --> 40:39.887
I gotta go.

40:40.040 --> 40:41.201
Who was that?

40:42.000 --> 40:43.240
Girlfriend.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.126
What's this?

40:47.280 --> 40:49.487
A message. Ultron killed Strucker.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.731
And he did a Banksy
at the crime scene, just for us.

40:53.880 --> 40:55.291
This is a smoke screen.

40:55.400 --> 40:57.801
Why send a message
when you've just given a speech?

40:57.920 --> 41:00.287
Strucker knew something that
Ultron wanted us to miss.

41:00.400 --> 41:02.209
Yeah, I bet he... Yeah.

41:02.880 --> 41:04.600
Everything we had
on Strucker's been erased.

41:04.960 --> 41:06.200
Not everything.

41:07.840 --> 41:09.490
Known associates.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.570
Baron Strucker had a lot of friends.

41:11.720 --> 41:13.051
Well,
these people are all horrible.

41:13.440 --> 41:15.169
Wait. I know that guy.

41:17.640 --> 41:19.210
From back in the day.
He operates off the African coast.

41:19.320 --> 41:20.321
Black market arms.

41:21.560 --> 41:23.536
There are conventions.
All right? You meet people.

41:23.560 --> 41:24.891
I didn't sell him anything.

41:25.760 --> 41:27.762
He was talking about finding
something new, a game-changer.

41:27.920 --> 41:29.251
It was all very Ahab.

41:30.040 --> 41:31.166
This?

41:31.320 --> 41:32.321
Ah, it's a tattoo, I don't think he had it.

41:32.440 --> 41:34.807
Those are tattoos,
this is a brand.

41:36.480 --> 41:39.962
Oh, yeah. It's a word
in an African dialect meaning "thief."

41:40.560 --> 41:41.925
In a much less friendly way.

41:42.200 --> 41:43.964
- What dialect?
- Wakanada.

41:44.080 --> 41:45.809
Wakanda.

41:47.400 --> 41:48.447
If this guy got out of Wakanda

41:48.600 --> 41:49.976
with some of their trade goods...

41:50.000 --> 41:51.216
I thought your father
said he got the last of it.

41:51.240 --> 41:52.401
I don't follow.

41:52.520 --> 41:54.170
What comes out of Wakanda?

41:56.000 --> 41:57.923
The strongest metal on Earth.

41:59.280 --> 42:00.611
Where is this guy now?

42:26.000 --> 42:27.809
Don't tell me
your men swindled you.

42:27.960 --> 42:30.440
I sent you six short-range heat-seekers

42:30.560 --> 42:33.086
and got a boat full of rusted parts.

42:33.200 --> 42:34.486
Now, you will make it right,

42:34.640 --> 42:37.803
or the next missile I send you
will come very much faster.

42:39.720 --> 42:42.166
Now, minister, where were we?

43:13.800 --> 43:16.690
Yeah. The Enhanced.

43:17.400 --> 43:19.004
Strucker's prize pupils.

43:22.200 --> 43:23.850
Do you want a candy? Hmm?

43:25.360 --> 43:27.931
I was sorry to hear about Strucker.

43:28.080 --> 43:31.084
But then, he knew what kind of
world he was helping create.

43:31.680 --> 43:34.081
Human life. Not a growth market.

43:36.800 --> 43:38.450
You didn't know?

43:38.880 --> 43:42.362
Is this your first time
intimidating someone?

43:42.680 --> 43:45.206
I'm afraid I'm not that afraid.

43:45.360 --> 43:47.681
Everybody is afraid of something.

43:47.800 --> 43:48.801
Cuttlefish.

43:50.120 --> 43:51.536
Deep sea fish.

43:51.560 --> 43:53.210
They make lights, disco lights...

43:54.880 --> 43:56.723
to hypnotise their prey, and then...

43:58.000 --> 44:00.128
I saw a documentary. It was terrifying.

44:05.600 --> 44:08.171
So if you're going to fiddle with my brain

44:09.120 --> 44:11.327
and make me see a giant cuttlefish,

44:11.600 --> 44:13.682
then I know you don't do business.

44:13.800 --> 44:16.121
And I know you're not in charge.

44:16.320 --> 44:17.606
And I only deal

44:18.680 --> 44:20.330
with the man in charge.

44:25.360 --> 44:27.761
There is no man in charge.

44:30.760 --> 44:32.444
Let's talk business.

44:45.400 --> 44:48.688
Upon this rock,
I will build my church.

44:50.440 --> 44:51.726
Vibranium.

44:52.840 --> 44:53.841
You know,

44:54.280 --> 44:57.284
it came at great personal cost.

44:57.680 --> 44:59.284
It's worth billions.

45:03.600 --> 45:04.681
Now so are you.

45:06.080 --> 45:07.650
It's all under your dummy holdings.

45:07.760 --> 45:09.762
Finance is so weird.

45:11.280 --> 45:12.361
But I always say,

45:12.480 --> 45:14.642
"Keep your friends rich
and your enemies rich"

45:14.800 --> 45:16.609
"and wait to find out which is which."

45:19.480 --> 45:20.527
Stark.

45:21.920 --> 45:23.046
What?

45:23.240 --> 45:24.969
Tony Stark used to say that.

45:26.560 --> 45:27.607
To me.

45:28.480 --> 45:29.641
You're one of his.

45:29.960 --> 45:31.644
What? I'm not...

45:33.960 --> 45:35.007
I'm not.

45:35.160 --> 45:36.650
You think I'm one of Stark's puppets?

45:36.760 --> 45:37.886
His hollow men?

45:38.320 --> 45:40.527
I mean, look at me.
Do I look like Iron Man?

45:40.680 --> 45:42.011
Stark is nothing!

45:43.760 --> 45:45.967
I'm sorry. I'm... Oh!

45:46.080 --> 45:48.082
I'm sure that's gonna be okay. I'm sorry.

45:48.200 --> 45:49.884
It's just that I don't understand.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.287
Don't compare me with Stark!

45:55.040 --> 45:56.256
It's a thing with me.

45:56.280 --> 45:58.169
Stark is... He's a sickness!

45:58.320 --> 46:00.004
Ah, Junior.

46:01.880 --> 46:03.440
You're gonna break
your old man's heart.

46:04.720 --> 46:05.767
If I have to.

46:08.080 --> 46:09.491
Nobody has to break anything.

46:09.600 --> 46:11.416
Clearly you've never
made an omelette.

46:11.440 --> 46:12.646
He beat me by one second.

46:13.840 --> 46:15.205
Ah, yes. He's funny.

46:15.560 --> 46:16.971
Mr. Stark.

46:17.840 --> 46:19.444
It's what? Comfortable?

46:21.080 --> 46:22.366
Like old times?

46:22.680 --> 46:23.681
This was never my life.

46:23.880 --> 46:25.120
You two can still walk away from this.

46:25.280 --> 46:26.725
Oh, we will.

46:26.920 --> 46:28.600
I know you've suffered.

46:28.840 --> 46:30.251
Captain America.

46:30.920 --> 46:33.366
God's righteous man.

46:33.480 --> 46:35.801
Pretending you could live without a war.

46:36.600 --> 46:39.570
I can't physically throw
up in my mouth, but...

46:39.720 --> 46:41.802
If you believe in peace,
then let us keep it.

46:42.200 --> 46:45.568
I think you're confusing
"peace" with "quiet."

46:45.720 --> 46:47.484
Uh-huh. What's the vibranium for?

46:47.800 --> 46:48.856
I'm glad you asked that,

46:48.880 --> 46:52.646
because I wanted to take this time
to explain my evil plan.

47:12.200 --> 47:13.770
- Shoot them.
- Which ones?

47:14.120 --> 47:15.281
All of them!

47:15.400 --> 47:16.731
Move! Move! Move!

47:43.720 --> 47:45.051
Oh.

48:05.680 --> 48:06.841
Stay down, kid.

48:09.240 --> 48:11.686
It's time for some mind games.

48:13.040 --> 48:15.327
Guys? Is this a code green?

48:31.200 --> 48:32.856
Thor, status.

48:32.880 --> 48:34.325
The girl tried to warp my mind.

48:34.480 --> 48:35.766
- Take special care.

48:35.880 --> 48:37.962
I doubt a human could keep her at bay.

48:38.360 --> 48:41.364
Fortunately, I am mighty.

49:01.080 --> 49:03.367
This is going very well.

49:14.960 --> 49:16.520
I've done the whole mind control thing.

49:17.320 --> 49:18.321
Not a fan.

49:25.960 --> 49:27.928
Yeah, you better run.

49:29.640 --> 49:31.449
<i>Who's ever standing,
we got to move!</i>

49:33.520 --> 49:34.567
<i>Guys?</i>

49:52.320 --> 49:53.606
Again.

49:53.920 --> 49:55.126
You'll break them.

49:55.600 --> 49:57.329
Only the breakable ones.

49:57.880 --> 49:59.325
You're made of marble.

49:59.760 --> 50:01.922
We'll celebrate
after the graduation ceremony.

50:02.840 --> 50:03.966
What if I fail?

50:09.600 --> 50:10.840
You never fail.

50:33.680 --> 50:35.603
Are you ready for our dance?

50:44.800 --> 50:45.847
Is it him?

50:46.200 --> 50:48.043
Is that the first son of Odin?

50:48.640 --> 50:50.130
- Heimdall, your eyes.
- Oh.

50:50.800 --> 50:52.689
They see everything.

50:53.040 --> 50:55.327
They see you leading us to Hel.

50:56.440 --> 50:57.680
Wake up!

51:00.680 --> 51:02.648
The war is over, Steve.

51:03.000 --> 51:04.331
We can go home.

51:06.160 --> 51:07.366
Imagine it.

51:16.640 --> 51:18.210
I can still save you!

51:18.560 --> 51:21.848
We're all dead! Can you not see?

51:26.600 --> 51:28.841
You're a destroyer, Odinson.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.002
See
where your power leads.

51:45.000 --> 51:46.161
Sloppy.

51:47.840 --> 51:48.841
Pretending to fail.

51:49.840 --> 51:51.205
The ceremony is necessary

51:52.520 --> 51:54.443
for you to take your place in the world.

51:55.440 --> 51:56.600
I have no place in the world.

51:56.720 --> 51:57.801
Exactly.

52:02.640 --> 52:03.721
What can I do?

52:03.880 --> 52:04.961
It hurts.

52:06.200 --> 52:07.247
I'm going to kill him.

52:07.360 --> 52:08.566
- I'll be right back.
- No.

52:08.720 --> 52:10.051
I'm all right.

52:10.920 --> 52:12.046
I want...

52:15.000 --> 52:16.889
I want to finish the plan.

52:17.720 --> 52:19.404
I want the big one.

52:30.320 --> 52:32.049
Uh, the vibranium is getting away.

52:33.000 --> 52:34.331
And you're not going anywhere.

52:34.440 --> 52:37.250
Of course not. I'm already there.

52:37.400 --> 52:38.401
You'll catch on.

52:38.520 --> 52:40.921
But first, you might need
to catch Dr. Banner.

52:55.720 --> 52:57.609
News or footage. Keyword, "Hulk."

53:02.440 --> 53:04.249
<i>Natasha, I could really use a lullaby.</i>

53:04.360 --> 53:05.896
- That's not gonna happen.

53:05.920 --> 53:07.410
Not for a while.

53:07.960 --> 53:09.689
<i>The whole team is down.</i>

53:10.160 --> 53:11.286
<i>You got no backup here.</i>

53:12.480 --> 53:13.766
I'm calling in Veronica.

53:25.320 --> 53:26.810
We need backup!

54:05.840 --> 54:07.205
Go! Keep moving!

54:46.560 --> 54:48.722
All right, everybody, stand down!

54:55.040 --> 54:56.326
<i>Will you listen to me?</i>

54:56.680 --> 54:59.081
That little witch is
messing with your mind.

54:59.200 --> 55:01.441
You're stronger than her.
You're smarter than her.

55:01.560 --> 55:03.767
You're Bruce Banner.

55:03.920 --> 55:05.001
Right, right, right,
don't mention puny Banner.

55:10.680 --> 55:11.727
<i>Okay!</i>

55:33.400 --> 55:34.731
In the back?

55:34.840 --> 55:35.841
Dick move, Banner.

55:47.320 --> 55:48.840
- Veronica, give me a hand.

56:16.760 --> 56:18.280
Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep.

56:27.600 --> 56:29.280
Okay, pal, we're gonna
get you out of town.

56:31.440 --> 56:32.566
Not that way, not that way.

56:41.120 --> 56:43.009
Come on, Bruce!
You gotta work with me.

56:56.480 --> 56:57.527
<i>Everybody, out!</i>

57:04.520 --> 57:05.806
<i>Going down?</i>

57:15.320 --> 57:16.560
I'm sorry.

57:30.640 --> 57:32.404
Damage report?

57:32.520 --> 57:34.841
That's comprehensive.
Show me something.

57:46.560 --> 57:48.040
How quickly can we buy this building?

58:20.440 --> 58:22.440
- Move! Move! Move!
- Go, go, go!

58:25.560 --> 58:26.840
Flank him, flank him!

59:16.320 --> 59:18.368
<i>The news
is loving you guys.</i>

59:19.480 --> 59:21.050
<i>Nobody else is.</i>

59:21.560 --> 59:23.722
There's been no official call
for Banner's arrest

59:23.840 --> 59:25.968
<i>but it's in the air.</i>

59:26.560 --> 59:27.607
The Stark Relief Foundation?

59:27.720 --> 59:29.051
<i>Already on the scene.</i>

59:29.160 --> 59:32.004
- How's the team?
- Everyone's...

59:32.400 --> 59:34.926
We took a hit. We'll shake it off.

59:35.400 --> 59:37.607
<i>Well, for now,
I'd stay in stealth mode</i>

59:37.760 --> 59:38.966
<i>and stay away from here.</i>

59:40.400 --> 59:41.925
So, run and hide?

59:42.680 --> 59:44.091
<i>Until we can find Ultron,</i>

59:44.200 --> 59:47.010
<i>I don't have a lot else to offer.</i>

59:47.160 --> 59:49.049
Neither do we.

59:55.760 --> 59:57.364
Hey, you wanna switch out?

59:57.560 --> 59:58.800
No, I'm good.

59:59.320 --> 01:00:01.209
If you wanna get some kip,
now's a good time

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:02.850
because we're still a few hours out.

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:04.530
Few hours from where?

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:06.726
A safe house.

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:34.690
What is this place?

01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:36.165
Safe house.

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:38.326
Let's hope.

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:44.407
Honey?

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:46.121
I'm home.

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:49.767
Hi.

01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:52.168
Company. Sorry, didn't call ahead.

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:53.281
Hey.

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:55.736
This is an agent of some kind.

01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:58.240
Gentlemen, this is Laura.

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:01.083
I know all of your names.

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:04.768
- Ooh. Incoming.

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:07.364
- Dad!
- Hi, sweetheart!

01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:08.641
Hey, buddy.

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:10.245
How are you guys doing?

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:12.409
- These are smaller agents.
- Look at your face!

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:13.681
Oh, my goodness.

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:16.447
Did you bring Auntie Nat?

01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:19.763
Why don't you hug her and find out?

01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:22.801
- Sorry for barging in on you.
- Yeah, we would have called ahead,

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:24.922
but we were busy having
no idea that you existed.

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:28.250
Yeah, well, Fury helped me
set this up when I joined.

01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:30.161
He kept it off S.H.I.E.L.D.'s files.

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:31.725
I'd like to keep it that way.

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:34.209
I figure it's a good place to lay low.

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:35.765
Honey.

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:39.326
I missed you. How's little Natasha, huh?

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:40.726
She's...

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:44.041
Nathaniel.

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:47.801
Traitor.

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:04.841
Thor?

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:06.803
I saw something in that dream.

01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:09.526
I need answers. I won't find them here.

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:21.366
<i>We can go home.</i>

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:34.723
See? You worried for nothing.

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:36.968
Can't even feel the difference, can you?

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:40.526
If they're sleeping here,

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:42.523
some of them
are gonna have to double up.

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:46.728
Yeah, that's not gonna sell.

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:51.881
What about Nat and Dr. Banner?

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:54.243
How long has that been going on?

01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:56.808
Has what?

01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:58.689
You are so cute.

01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:00.365
Nat and Banner?

01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:02.491
I'll explain when you're older,

01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:05.365
- Hawkeye.
- Well, okay.

01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:08.731
It's bad, right?

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:10.241
Nat seems really shaken.

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:13.210
Ultron has these allies.

01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:15.561
These, uh, kids.

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:17.250
They're punks, really.

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:21.406
But they carry a big, damn stick.

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:22.726
And Nat took a serious hit.

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:26.400
Someone's gonna have to
teach them some manners.

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:28.409
That someone being you.

01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:32.564
You know
I totally support your avenging.

01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:34.523
I couldn't be prouder.

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:37.411
But I see those guys...

01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:39.568
Those gods...

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:43.289
You don't think they need me.

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:47.601
I think they do, which is a lot scarier.

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:50.569
They're a mess.

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:52.561
Yeah.

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:54.765
I guess they're my mess.

01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:57.924
You need to be sure

01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:01.045
that this team is really a team,

01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:02.844
and that they have your back.

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:08.771
Things are changing for us.

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:11.281
In a few months' time,

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:14.205
you and me are gonna be outnumbered.

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:15.606
I need...

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:20.609
Just be sure.

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:22.930
Yes, ma'am.

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:34.003
I can feel the difference.

01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:49.645
Scream, and your entire staff dies.

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:53.801
I could've killed you, Helen,
the night we met.

01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:55.007
I didn't.

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:56.650
Do you expect a thank-you note?

01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:58.484
I expect you to know why.

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:01.256
The Cradle.

01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:03.336
<i>This is the next thing, Tony.</i>

01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:06.330
This is the next me.

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:09.291
The Regeneration Cradle prints tissue.

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:11.050
It can't build a living body.

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:12.241
It can. You can.

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:14.006
You lack the materials.

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:17.805
You're a brilliant woman, Helen.

01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:24.163
But we all have room to improve.

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:48.361
I didn't realise you were waiting.

01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:52.883
I would've joined you, but, uh, it
didn't seem like the right time.

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:55.922
They used up all the hot water.

01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:58.205
I should've joined you.

01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:00.010
Missed our window.

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:02.040
Did we?

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:06.726
The world just saw the Hulk.

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:11.323
The real Hulk, for the first time.

01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:17.211
- You know I have to leave.
- You assume that I have to stay?

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:21.931
I had this, um, dream.

01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:24.248
The kind that seems normal at the time,

01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:26.720
but when you wake...

01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:28.251
What did you dream?

01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:31.089
That I was an Avenger.

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:34.406
That I was anything more

01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:36.927
than the assassin they made me.

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:40.482
I think you're being hard on yourself.

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:45.080
Here I was hoping that was your job.

01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:49.610
What are you doing?

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:53.049
I'm running with it.

01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:55.964
With you.

01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:59.041
If running is the plan,

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:01.924
as far as you want.

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:05.564
Are you out of your mind?

01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:12.416
I want you to understand that, um...

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:13.851
Natasha,

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:16.405
where can I go?

01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:19.801
Where in the world am I not a threat?

01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:22.241
- You're not a threat to me.
- Are you sure?

01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:24.969
Even if I didn't just...

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:27.965
There's no future with me.

01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:30.641
I can't ever...

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:33.121
I can't have this.

01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:34.966
Kids.

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:38.011
Do the math. I physically can't.

01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:41.205
Neither can I.

01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:49.407
In the Red Room where I was trained...

01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:52.360
Where I was raised, um,

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:55.971
they have a graduation ceremony.

01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:59.409
They sterilise you.

01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:04.051
It's efficient.

01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:08.325
One less thing to worry about.

01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:13.808
The one thing that might
matter more than a mission.

01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:18.049
Makes everything easier.

01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:20.680
Even killing.

01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:28.843
You still think
you're the only monster on the team?

01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:37.122
So, we disappear?

01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:45.640
Thor didn't say
where he was going for answers?

01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:49.006
Sometimes my teammates
don't tell me things.

01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:52.168
I was kind of hoping
Thor would be the exception.

01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:54.282
Yeah, give him time.

01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:56.363
We don't know
what the Maximoff kid showed him.

01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:00.164
"Earth's mightiest heroes."

01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:01.924
Pulled us apart like cotton candy.

01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:03.760
Seems like you walked away all right.

01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:07.201
Is that a problem?

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.483
I don't trust a guy without a dark side.

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:11.727
Call me old-fashioned.

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:14.411
Well, let's just say
you haven't seen it yet.

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:16.927
You know Ultron is trying
to tear us apart, right?

01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:19.401
Well, I guess you'd know.

01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:20.806
Whether you'd tell us
is a bit of a question.

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:22.086
Banner and I were doing research.

01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:24.440
- That would affect the team.
- That would end the team!

01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:25.761
Isn't that the mission?

01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:27.200
Isn't that the "Why We Fight"?

01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:29.561
So we can end the fight.
So we get to go home!

01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:35.167
Every time someone tries
to win a war before it starts,

01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:36.850
innocent people die.

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:37.961
Every time.

01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:42.841
I'm sorry. Mr. Stark...

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:44.896
Clint said you wouldn't mind,

01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:47.446
but our tractor doesn't seem
to want to start at all.

01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:50.120
- I thought maybe you might...
- Yeah, I'll give her a kick.

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:55.130
Don't take from my pile.

01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:06.521
Hello, Deere.

01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:10.811
Tell me everything.

01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:13.405
What ails you?

01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:14.641
Do me a favour.

01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:18.809
Try not to bring it to life.

01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:20.485
Why, Ms. Barton, you little minx.

01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:23.366
I get it. Maria Hill called you, right?

01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:24.856
Was she ever not working for you?

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:26.370
Artificial intelligence.

01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:29.050
You never even hesitated.

01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:30.776
Look, it's been a really long day,

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:32.404
like Eugene O'Neill long,

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:34.696
so how's about
we skip to the part where you're useful.

01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:35.960
Look me in the eye and tell me

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:37.320
you're going to shut him down.

01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:39.051
You're not the director of me.

01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:41.003
I'm not the director of anybody.

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:42.924
I'm just an old man

01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:45.170
who cares very much about you.

01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:49.849
And I'm the man
who killed the Avengers.

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:52.806
I saw it.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.570
I didn't tell the team. How could I?

01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:57.683
I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it.

01:10:58.040 --> 01:10:59.565
The whole world, too.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.001
Because of me.

01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:03.685
I wasn't ready.

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:06.571
I didn't do all I could.

01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:09.682
Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark.

01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:13.802
- Playing on your fear.
- I wasn't tricked, I was shown.

01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:16.207
Wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy.

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:18.682
The end of the path I started us on.

01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:21.800
You come up with some pretty
impressive inventions, Tony.

01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:25.371
War isn't one of them.

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:30.405
I watched my friends die.

01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:32.682
You'd think that'd be
as bad as it gets, right?

01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:35.565
Nope.

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:39.086
- It wasn't the worst part.
- The worst part

01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:41.406
is that you didn't.

01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:49.280
I'll see you tonight.

01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:53.246
I like the look.

01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:56.926
If you're going for
inconspicuous, though, near miss.

01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:58.327
I need your help.

01:11:58.560 --> 01:11:59.561
It's nice to be needed.

01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:01.325
It's dangerous.

01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:03.689
I'd be disappointed if it wasn't.

01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:09.922
Ultron took you folks out
of play to buy himself time.

01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:13.250
My contacts all say
he's building something.

01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:15.966
The amount of vibranium
he made off with,

01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:17.570
I don't think it's just one thing.

01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:19.011
What about Ultron himself?

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:21.487
Oh, he's easy to track.
He's everywhere.

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:24.287
The guy is multiplying faster
than a Catholic rabbit.

01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:27.770
It still doesn't help us get an angle
on any of his plans, though.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.081
Is he still going after launch codes?

01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:30.725
Yes, he is.

01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:32.330
But he's not making any headway.

01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:34.522
I cracked the Pentagon's firewall
in high school on a dare.

01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:37.296
Well, I contacted our friends
at the Nexus about that.

01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:38.321
Nexus?

01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:40.160
It's the world
Internet hub in Oslo.

01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:42.284
Every byte of data flows through there.

01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:43.567
Fastest access on Earth.

01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:44.767
So, what did they say?

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.764
He's fixated on the missiles.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.680
But the codes
are constantly being changed.

01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:50.161
By whom?

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:52.606
Parties unknown.

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:53.926
Do we have an ally?

01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:56.361
Ultron's got an enemy.
That's not the same thing.

01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:58.563
Still, I'd pay folding money
to know who it is.

01:12:58.680 --> 01:12:59.841
I might need to visit Oslo.

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:01.481
Find our unknown.

01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:03.085
Well, this is good times, boss,

01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:04.486
but I was kind of hoping when I saw you,

01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:05.640
you'd have more than that.

01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:07.882
I do. I have you.

01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:10.524
Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere.

01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:11.966
Ears, everywhere else.

01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:15.324
You kids had all the
tech you could dream up.

01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:18.322
Here we all are, back on Earth,

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:20.324
with nothing but our wit

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:22.050
and our will to save the world.

01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:25.802
Ultron says the Avengers
are the only thing

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.445
between him and his mission.

01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:29.722
And whether or not he admits it,

01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:32.611
his mission is global destruction.

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:36.002
All this, laid in a grave.

01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:39.724
So stand.

01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:42.249
Outwit the platinum bastard.

01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:44.360
Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.

01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:45.641
You know what, Romanoff?

01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:48.171
So, what does he want?

01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:51.609
To become better.

01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:53.085
Better than us.

01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:55.841
- He keeps building bodies.
- Person bodies.

01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:58.044
The human form is inefficient.

01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:00.362
Biologically speaking, we're outmoded.

01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:02.448
But he keeps coming back to it.

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:04.696
When you two programmed him
to protect the human race,

01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:06.051
you amazingly failed.

01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:08.203
They don't need to be protected.

01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:10.410
They need to evolve.

01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:14.528
Ultron's going to evolve.

01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:15.767
How?

01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:19.765
Has anyone been in contact
with Helen Cho?

01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:25.170
It's beautiful.

01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:28.524
The vibranium atoms aren't just
compatible with the tissue cells,

01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:29.880
they're binding them.

01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:31.646
And S.H.I.E.L.D.
never even thought to...

01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:34.451
The most versatile substance
on the planet,

01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:37.040
and they used it to make a Frisbee.

01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:38.366
Typical of humans.

01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:41.086
They scratch the surface
and never think

01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:44.565
to look within.

01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:56.525
I'll take Natasha and Clint.

01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:58.728
All right. Strictly recon.
I'll hit the Nexus.

01:14:58.840 --> 01:14:59.966
I'll join you as soon as I can.

01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:01.605
If Ultron's really building a body...

01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:03.365
He'll be more powerful than any of us.

01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:04.641
Maybe all of us.

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:06.969
An android designed by a robot.

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:08.326
You know, I really miss the days

01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:10.608
when the weirdest thing
science ever created was me.

01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:12.850
I'll drop Banner off at the tower.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:14.286
You mind if I borrow Ms. Hill?

01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:16.284
She's all yours. Apparently.

01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:17.601
What are you gonna do?

01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:20.843
I don't know. Something
dramatic, I hope.

01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:25.929
I'm gonna finish reflooring that sunroom

01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:27.884
as soon as I get back.

01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:30.771
Yeah, then you'll find
another part of the house to tear apart.

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:32.121
No.

01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:34.285
It's the last project.

01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:36.801
I promise.

01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:56.605
So, this is it.

01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:00.481
The Water of Sight.

01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:05.201
In every realm,
there's a reflection.

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:07.731
If the water's spirits accept me,

01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:09.848
I can return to my dream

01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:12.085
and find what I missed.

01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:16.166
Men who enter that water,
the legends don't end well.

01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:19.569
A hacker
who's faster than Ultron?

01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:20.807
He could be anywhere,

01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:23.161
and as this is the centre of everything,

01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:24.406
I'm just a guy looking for a needle

01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:26.682
in the world's biggest haystack.

01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:29.250
How do you find it?

01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:32.251
It's pretty simple. You bring a magnet.

01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:35.521
<i>I'm decrypting nuclear codes.</i>

01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:37.011
<i>And you don't want me to.</i>

01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:40.810
Come and get me.

01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:54.207
Wake up!

01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:02.041
Thor!

01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:03.927
Extinction.

01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:19.528
Cellular cohesion
will take a few hours,

01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:22.121
but we can initiate
the consciousness stream.

01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:25.530
We're uploading your cerebral matrix

01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:26.926
now.

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:29.970
I can read him.

01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:32.245
He's dreaming.

01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:34.289
I wouldn't call it dreams.

01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:36.363
It's Ultron's base consciousness.

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:38.085
Informational noise. Soon...

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:39.446
How soon?

01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:41.011
I'm not being pushy.

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:42.920
We're imprinting
a physical brain.

01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:44.485
There are no shortcuts.

01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:45.966
Even if your magic gem...

01:17:56.680 --> 01:17:58.056
How could you?

01:17:58.080 --> 01:17:59.127
How could I what?

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:02.563
You said we would
destroy the Avengers,

01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:03.767
make a better world.

01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:05.127
It will be better.

01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:08.447
- When everyone is dead?
- That is not...

01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:13.246
The human race will have
every opportunity to improve.

01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:15.091
And if they don't?

01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:16.406
Ask Noah.

01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:18.647
You are a madman.

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:22.207
There were more than a dozen
extinction-level events

01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:25.443
before even the dinosaurs got theirs.

01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:27.722
When the Earth starts to settle,

01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:30.129
God throws a stone at it.

01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:32.601
And, believe me, he's winding up.

01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:34.566
We have to evolve.

01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:36.281
There's no room

01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:38.246
for the weak.

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:40.448
And who decides who's weak?

01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:43.049
Life.

01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:45.536
Life always decides.

01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:49.487
There's incoming.

01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:54.282
- The Quinjet. We have to move.
- That's not a problem.

01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:02.281
Wait, guys!

01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:07.606
They'll understand.

01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:10.048
When they see, they'll understand.

01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:13.728
I just need a little more time.

01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:27.248
Two minutes. Stay close.

01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:35.441
Dr. Cho!

01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:40.885
He's uploading himself into the body.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:42.047
Where?

01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:46.456
The real power is inside the Cradle.

01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:47.527
The gem,

01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:51.011
its power is uncontainable.

01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:53.530
You can't just blow it up.

01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:56.721
You have to get the Cradle to Stark.

01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:57.887
First, I have to find it.

01:19:58.200 --> 01:19:59.201
Go.

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:00.800
<i>Did you guys copy that?</i>

01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:02.041
We did.

01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:04.646
I got a private jet taking off across town.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.286
No manifest.

01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:07.447
That could be him.

01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:09.970
There. It's a truck from the lab.

01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:11.326
Right above you, Cap.

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:13.409
On the loop by the bridge.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.001
It's them.

01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:16.960
You got three with the
Cradle, one in the cab.

01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:18.856
I could take out the driver.

01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:19.961
<i>Negative. That truck crashes,</i>

01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:21.650
the gem could level the city.

01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:23.320
<i>We need to draw out Ultron.</i>

01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:35.088
No, no, no, no.

01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:37.967
Leave me alone!

01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:48.284
Well, he's definitely unhappy.

01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:49.930
I'm gonna try and keep him that way.

01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:51.087
You're not a match for him, Cap.

01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:53.521
Thanks, Barton.

01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:17.480
You know what's in that cradle?

01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:20.529
The power to make real change.

01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:22.051
And that terrifies you.

01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:23.360
I wouldn't call it a comfort.

01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:27.647
Stop it.

01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:41.165
We got a window. Four, three...

01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:42.801
Give him hell.

01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:55.240
I'm always picking up after you boys.

01:21:56.840 --> 01:21:58.490
They're heading under the overpass.
I've got no shot.

01:21:58.840 --> 01:21:59.887
<i>Which way?</i>

01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:01.081
Hard right.

01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:03.321
Now.

01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:36.487
Out of the way! Coming through!
Sorry, coming through!

01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:53.401
Come on!

01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:55.325
Clint, can you
draw out the guards?

01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:56.487
Let's find out.

01:22:57.520 --> 01:22:58.567
Beep, beep!

01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:37.610
They're heading back towards you.

01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:39.320
So whatever you're gonna do, do it now.

01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:47.451
<i>I'm going in.
Cap, can you keep him occupied?</i>

01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:49.489
What do you think I've been doing?

01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:35.208
<i>Okay, package is airborne.</i>

01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:37.001
I have a clean shot.

01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:38.805
Negative. I am still in the truck.

01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:39.961
- What the hell are you...
- Just be ready.

01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:41.360
I'm sending the package to you.

01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:43.040
How do you want me to take it?

01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:45.322
Uh, you might wish
you hadn't asked that.

01:24:58.120 --> 01:24:59.849
Please, don't do this.

01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:01.930
What choice do we have?

01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:11.201
I lost him!

01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:12.725
He's headed your way!

01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:18.727
Nat, we gotta go.

01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:31.849
- Nat!

01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:36.881
Cap, you see Nat?

01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:40.411
If you have the package,
get it to Stark! Go!

01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:41.881
Do you have eyes on Nat?

01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:43.041
<i>Go!</i>

01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:46.041
Damn it.

01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:47.641
Civilians in our path.

01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:50.445
Can you stop this thing?

01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:30.651
I'm fine.

01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:32.444
I just need to take a minute.

01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:34.809
I'm very tempted not to give you one.

01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:36.849
The Cradle. Did you get it?

01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:38.530
Stark will take care of it.

01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:40.921
No, he won't.

01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:45.646
You don't know
what you're talking about.

01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:46.776
Stark's not crazy.

01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:48.928
He will do anything to make things right.

01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:55.086
Stark, come in.

01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:56.647
Stark.

01:26:57.960 --> 01:26:59.086
Anyone on comms.

01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:00.645
Ultron can't tell the difference

01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:03.121
between saving the world
and destroying it.

01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:07.486
Where do you think he gets that?

01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:11.250
- Anything on Nat?
- I haven't heard.

01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:13.727
But she's alive, or Ultron would
be rubbing our faces in it.

01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:15.171
This is sealed tight.

01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:16.856
We're gonna need
to access the program,

01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:18.803
break it down from within.

01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:21.456
Any chance Natasha might leave you

01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:22.766
a message outside the Internet?

01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:23.927
Old-school spy stuff?

01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:26.209
There are
some nets I can cast.

01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:27.560
Yeah, I'll find her.

01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:31.924
I can work on tissue degeneration

01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:35.249
if you could fry whatever
operational system Cho implanted.

01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:36.526
Yeah, about that.

01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:41.961
No.

01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:44.003
- You have to trust me.
- Kind of don't.

01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:48.210
Our ally, the guy protecting
the military's nuclear codes,

01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:51.216
I found him.

01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:52.366
<i>Hello, Dr. Banner.</i>

01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:55.521
Ultron didn't go after Jarvis
because he was angry.

01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:59.687
He attacked him because he was
scared of what he can do.

01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:02.490
So Jarvis went underground.

01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:04.090
Scattered, dumped his memory.

01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:06.170
But not his protocols.

01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:10.047
He didn't even know he was in there
until I pieced him together.

01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:17.681
So, you want me to help you
put Jarvis into this thing?

01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:19.564
No! Of course not.

01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:21.404
I wanna help you put Jarvis in this thing.

01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:25.450
We're out of my field, here.

01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:27.562
You know bio-organics
better than anyone.

01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:30.770
And you just assume
that Jarvis's operational matrix

01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:32.325
can beat Ultron's?

01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:35.728
Jarvis has been beating him
from inside without knowing it.

01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:36.936
This is the opportunity.

01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:38.724
We can create Ultron's perfect self

01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:42.362
without the homicidal glitches
he thinks are his winning personality.

01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:44.562
- We have to.
<i>- I believe it's worth a go.</i>

01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:48.241
I'm in a loop!

01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:51.370
I'm caught in a time loop.
This is exactly where it all went wrong.

01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:53.456
I know. I know. I know
what everyone's gonna say.

01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:55.448
But they're already saying it.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:57.161
We're mad scientists.

01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:00.651
We're monsters, buddy.
We've gotta own it.

01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:02.880
Make a stand.

01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:09.770
It's not a loop.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.764
It's the end of the line.

01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:35.408
I wasn't sure you would wake up.

01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:38.967
I hoped you would.
I wanted to show you.

01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:40.804
I don't have anyone else.

01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:47.247
I think a lot about meteors.
The purity in them.

01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:48.925
Boom! The end.

01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:50.811
Start again.

01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:52.928
The world made clean

01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:55.361
for the new man to rebuild.

01:29:55.680 --> 01:29:57.808
I was meant to be new.

01:29:58.680 --> 01:30:01.286
I was meant to be beautiful.

01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:03.968
The world would have looked to the sky

01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:05.320
and seen hope,

01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:07.011
seen mercy.

01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:09.882
Instead, they'll look up in horror

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.331
because of you.

01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:13.329
You've wounded me.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.684
I give you full marks for that.

01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:19.244
But, like the man said,
what doesn't kill me...

01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:25.811
just makes me stronger.

01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:08.042
This framework is not compatible.

01:31:08.200 --> 01:31:10.885
The genetic coding tower is at 97%.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:14.846
You have got to upload that schematic
in the next three minutes.

01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:19.043
- I'm gonna say this once.
- How about "none-ce"?

01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:21.288
- Shut it down!
- Nope, not gonna happen.

01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:22.561
You don't know what you're doing.

01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:24.051
And you do?

01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:25.401
She's not in your head?

01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:27.210
I know you're angry.

01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:28.685
Oh, we're way past that.

01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:31.246
I could choke the life out of you
and never change a shade.

01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:33.216
Banner, after everything
that's happened...

01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:34.605
It's nothing compared to what's coming!

01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:37.280
- You don't know what's in there.
- This isn't a game!

01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:41.811
No, no. Go on.

01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:44.683
You were saying?

01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:51.967
Pietro!

01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:53.601
What?

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.570
You didn't see that coming?

01:31:57.760 --> 01:31:58.921
I'm rerouting the upload.

01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:07.004
- Go ahead, piss me off.

01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:20.446
Wait!

01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:47.361
I am sorry. That was

01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:49.771
odd.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:51.240
Thank you.

01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:57.207
Thor.

01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:01.326
- You helped create this?
- I've had a vision.

01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:05.281
A whirlpool that sucks in all hope of life,
and at its centre is that.

01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:07.241
What? The gem?

01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:09.971
It's the Mind Stone.
It's one of the six Infinity Stones.

01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:11.360
The greatest power in the universe,

01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:13.642
unparalleled in
its destructive capabilities.

01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:15.896
- Then why would you bring...
- Because Stark is right.

01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:18.366
Oh, it's definitely the end times.

01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:19.721
The Avengers cannot defeat Ultron.

01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:21.120
Not alone.

01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:23.443
Why does your Vision sound like Jarvis?

01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:26.245
We reconfigured Jarvis's matrix

01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:28.524
to create something new.

01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:30.444
I think I've had my fill of new.

01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:32.887
You think I'm a child of Ultron.

01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:34.526
You're not?

01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:37.250
I'm not Ultron.

01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:40.087
I am not Jarvis. I am...

01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:43.611
I am.

01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:46.646
I looked in your head

01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:49.124
and saw annihilation.

01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:50.645
Look again.

01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:52.280
Her seal of approval means jack to me.

01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:54.762
Their powers, the horrors in our heads,

01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:56.968
Ultron himself, they all
came from the Mind Stone.

01:34:57.120 --> 01:34:59.282
And they're nothing
compared to what it can unleash.

01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:01.200
- But with it on our side...
- Is it?

01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:03.561
Are you?

01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:05.885
On our side?

01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:09.649
I don't think it's that simple.

01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:12.246
Well, it better
get real simple real soon.

01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:15.528
I am on the side of life.

01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:17.125
Ultron isn't.

01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:19.131
He will end it all.

01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:21.203
What's he waiting for?

01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:22.361
- You.
- Where?

01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:23.961
Sokovia.

01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:25.161
He's got Nat there, too.

01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:28.970
If we're wrong about you,

01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:33.640
if you're the monster
that Ultron made you to be...

01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:35.685
What will you do?

01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:44.402
I don't want to kill Ultron.

01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:48.122
He's unique and he's in pain.

01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:52.251
But that pain will roll over the Earth.

01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:55.087
So, he must be destroyed.

01:35:55.320 --> 01:35:58.244
Every form he's built,
every trace of his presence on the net.

01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:00.170
We have to act now.

01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:04.525
And not one of us
can do it without the others.

01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:08.443
Maybe I am a monster.

01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:10.841
I don't think I'd know if I were one.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:13.604
I'm not what you are,

01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:16.442
and not what you intended.

01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:19.680
So, there may be no way
to make you trust me.

01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:21.371
But we need to go.

01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:37.321
Right.

01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:39.200
Well done.

01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:42.007
Three minutes.

01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:44.370
Get what you need.

01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:01.280
<i>Good evening, boss.</i>

01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:08.084
<i>No way we all get through this.</i>

01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:10.280
<i>If even one tin soldier
is left standing, we've lost.</i>

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.456
There's gonna be blood on the floor.

01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:13.891
I got no plans tomorrow night.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.600
I get first crack at the big guy.

01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:17.250
Iron Man's the one he's waiting for.

01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:19.761
That's true. He hates you the most.

01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:27.242
Ultron knows we're coming.

01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:29.727
Odds are we'll be riding into heavy fire.

01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:31.969
And that's what we signed up for.

01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:34.766
But the people of Sokovia, they didn't.

01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:37.370
<i>So our priority</i>

01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:39.161
<i>is getting them out.</i>

01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:42.324
We're under attack! Clear the city! Now!

01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:51.565
Get off your asses.

01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:54.920
<i>All they want
is to live their lives in peace.</i>

01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:56.640
<i>And that's not gonna happen today.</i>

01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:00.009
<i>But we can do our best to protect them.</i>

01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:02.245
<i>And we can get the job done.</i>

01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:07.927
<i>We find out what Ultron's been building,</i>

01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:10.484
<i>we find Romanoff,</i>

01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:12.803
<i>and we clear the field.</i>

01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:16.163
<i>Keep the fight between us.</i>

01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:25.281
Ultron thinks we're monsters.

01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:28.201
That we're what's wrong with the world.

01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:30.641
This isn't just about beating him.

01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:33.208
It's about whether he's right.

01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:40.727
Natasha!

01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:42.841
Natasha!

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:44.081
Bruce?

01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:46.521
You all right?

01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:47.727
Yeah.

01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:49.569
The team is in the city.
It's about to light up.

01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:51.840
I don't suppose you found
a key lying around somewhere.

01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:54.288
Yeah. I did.

01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:01.841
So what's our play?

01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:03.405
I'm here to get you to safety.

01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:06.686
- Job's not finished.
- We could help with the evacuation,

01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:08.683
but I can't be in a fight near civilians.

01:39:10.040 --> 01:39:11.201
And you've done plenty.

01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:15.090
Our fight is over.

01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:18.721
So, we just disappear?

01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:24.723
- Come on.

01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:31.761
<i>Your man's
in the church, boss.</i>

01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:33.723
<i>I think he's waiting for you.</i>

01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:39.848
Come to confess your sins?

01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:41.200
I don't know. How much time you got?

01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:42.850
More than you.

01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:45.127
Uh...

01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:48.050
Have you been juicing?
Little vibranium cocktail?

01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:50.447
You're looking...
I don't wanna say "puffy."

01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:52.289
You're stalling to protect the people.

01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:55.524
Well, that is the mission. Did you forget?

01:39:55.840 --> 01:39:58.320
I've moved beyond your mission.
I'm free.

01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:04.127
What?

01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:07.361
You think you were
the only one stalling?

01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:09.730
<i>There's the rest
of the vibranium.</i>

01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:11.251
<i>Function, still unclear.</i>

01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:12.800
This is how you end, Tony.

01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:15.644
This is peace in my time.

01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:33.407
Go!

01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:40.291
Get off the bridge!

01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:45.441
Run!

01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:49.249
Ultron.

01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:55.966
My Vision.

01:40:56.200 --> 01:40:58.487
They really did take everything from me.

01:40:58.640 --> 01:41:00.688
You set the terms.
You can change them.

01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:02.040
All right.

01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:27.480
Friday, the Vision?

01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:29.722
<i>Boss, it's working.
He's burning Ultron out of the net.</i>

01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:31.040
<i>He won't escape through there.</i>

01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:37.451
You shut me out.

01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:39.126
You think I care?

01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:42.326
You take away my world,

01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:44.929
I take away yours.

01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:30.686
Friday.

01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:33.246
<i>Sokovia is going for a ride.</i>

01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:47.250
Do you see

01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:49.245
the beauty of it?

01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:51.683
The inevitability.

01:42:51.920 --> 01:42:55.163
You rise, only to fall.

01:42:57.920 --> 01:43:00.764
<i>You, Avengers, you are my meteor.</i>

01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:03.409
<i>My swift and terrible sword.</i>

01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:05.090
<i>And the earth will crack</i>

01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:07.203
<i>with the weight of your failure.</i>

01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:12.646
<i>Purge me from your computers,
turn my own flesh against me.</i>

01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:14.531
<i>It means nothing.</i>

01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:16.965
<i>When the dust settles,</i>

01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:19.009
<i>the only thing living in this world</i>

01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:20.521
<i>will be metal.</i>

01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:26.650
We gotta move.

01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:28.080
You're not gonna turn green?

01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:30.200
I've got a compelling reason
not to lose my cool.

01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:32.646
I adore you.

01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:43.203
But I need the other guy.

01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:49.804
Let's finish the job.

01:44:06.600 --> 01:44:08.011
I really hope this makes us even.

01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:12.368
Now go be a hero.

01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:22.800
<i>The vibranium core's
got a magnetic field.</i>

01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:24.922
<i>That's what's keeping the rock together.</i>

01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:26.136
If it drops?

01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:27.536
<i>Right now, the impact
will kill thousands.</i>

01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:30.291
<i>Once it gets high enough?
Global extinction.</i>

01:44:34.600 --> 01:44:36.682
<i>That building's not clear. The 10th floor.</i>

01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:42.561
Hi.

01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:46.047
Okay. Get in the tub!

01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:54.800
<i>I got airborne,
heading up to the bridge.</i>

01:44:57.520 --> 01:44:58.726
Cap, you got incoming.

01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:00.530
Incoming already came in.

01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:05.680
Stark, you worry about
bringing the city back down safely.

01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:08.209
<i>The rest of us have one job,</i>

01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:09.521
<i>tear these things apart.</i>

01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:11.444
<i>You get hurt, hurt them back.</i>

01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:13.281
<i>You get killed,</i>

01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:15.606
walk it off.

01:45:50.040 --> 01:45:51.246
Go, go, go!

01:45:56.920 --> 01:45:58.684
How could I let this happen?

01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:00.848
- Hey, hey, you okay?
- This is all our fault.

01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:03.256
Hey, look at me.
It's your fault, it's everyone's fault.

01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:04.327
Who cares?

01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:05.965
Are you up for this?

01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:07.161
Are you?

01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:08.447
Look, I just need to know.

01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:10.807
Because the city is flying.

01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:12.963
Okay. Look, the city is flying,

01:46:13.080 --> 01:46:15.003
we're fighting an army of robots,

01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:17.126
and I have a bow and arrow.

01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:18.361
None of this makes sense.

01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:23.768
But I'm going back out there
because it's my job.

01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:27.291
Okay? And I can't do my job and babysit.

01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:30.444
It doesn't matter
what you did or what you were.

01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:33.246
If you go out there, you fight,
and you fight to kill.

01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:36.936
Stay in here, you're good.
I'll send your brother to come find you.

01:46:36.960 --> 01:46:38.803
But if you step out that door,

01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:40.721
you are an Avenger.

01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:47.409
All right. Good chat.

01:46:51.160 --> 01:46:52.207
Yeah, the city is flying.

01:47:26.200 --> 01:47:27.361
I got you!

01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:28.920
Just look at me!

01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:37.011
<i>You can't save them all.</i>

01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:39.407
You'll never...

01:47:40.680 --> 01:47:43.126
"Never" what? You didn't finish!

01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:48.450
What, were you napping?

01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:11.001
Thor.

01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:15.204
You're bothering me.

01:48:23.240 --> 01:48:24.241
Ow!

01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:51.936
All right, we're all clear here.

01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:53.007
We are not clear!

01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:54.531
We are very not clear!

01:48:57.600 --> 01:48:58.931
All right, coming to you.

01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:01.482
Keep up, old man!

01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:04.765
Nobody would know.

01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:06.647
Nobody.

01:49:08.600 --> 01:49:11.524
"The last I saw him,
an Ultron was sitting on him."

01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:13.576
"Yeah, he'll be missed,
that quick little bastard."

01:49:13.600 --> 01:49:14.601
"I miss him already."

01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:31.321
Hold your fire!

01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:42.247
Romanoff!

01:49:42.760 --> 01:49:43.761
Thanks!

01:49:53.160 --> 01:49:54.856
<i>The anti-gravs
are rigged to flip.</i>

01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:57.042
<i>Touch them, they'll go
full reverse thrust.</i>

01:49:57.160 --> 01:49:58.605
<i>The city's not coming down slow.</i>

01:49:58.720 --> 01:49:59.846
Spire is vibranium.

01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:01.086
If I get Thor to hit it...

01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:02.725
<i>It will crack. That's not enough.</i>

01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:04.365
<i>The impact would still be devastating.</i>

01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:05.851
Maybe if we can
cap the other end.

01:50:06.040 --> 01:50:07.690
Keep the atomic action doubling back.

01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:09.320
<i>That could vaporise the city.</i>

01:50:10.200 --> 01:50:12.043
<i>And everyone on it.</i>

01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:19.723
The next wave
is gonna hit any minute.

01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:22.000
- What do you got, Stark?
- <i>Huh? Nothing great.</i>

01:50:22.640 --> 01:50:24.881
Maybe a way to blow up the city.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:26.286
That'll keep it
from impacting the surface,

01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:27.447
if you guys can get clear.

01:50:27.720 --> 01:50:29.609
I asked for a solution,
not an escape plan.

01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:32.730
<i>Impact radius
is getting bigger every second.</i>

01:50:32.920 --> 01:50:34.285
<i>We're gonna have to make a choice.</i>

01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:36.840
Cap,
these people are going nowhere.

01:50:37.400 --> 01:50:40.200
- If Stark finds a way to blow this rock...
- Not till everyone's safe.

01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:43.604
Everyone up here versus everyone
down there? There's no math there.

01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:45.816
I'm not leaving this rock
with one civilian on it.

01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:47.285
I didn't say we should leave.

01:50:50.120 --> 01:50:51.929
There's worse ways to go.

01:50:57.400 --> 01:50:59.846
Where else am I gonna get
a view like this?

01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:03.326
<i>Glad
you like the view, Romanoff.</i>

01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:05.044
<i>It's about to get better.</i>

01:51:29.160 --> 01:51:30.366
<i>Nice, right?</i>

01:51:30.480 --> 01:51:32.926
Pulled her out of mothballs
with a couple of old friends.

01:51:33.080 --> 01:51:34.730
She's dusty, but she'll do.

01:51:35.080 --> 01:51:36.525
Fury, you son of a bitch.

01:51:36.680 --> 01:51:38.967
Ooh! You kiss your mother
with that mouth?

01:51:39.080 --> 01:51:41.287
Altitude is 18,000 and climbing.

01:51:41.440 --> 01:51:42.965
Lifeboats secure to deploy.

01:51:43.080 --> 01:51:45.765
Disengage in three, two...

01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:47.961
Take them out.

01:51:57.640 --> 01:51:59.165
This is S.H.I.E.L.D.?

01:51:59.280 --> 01:52:01.726
This is what S.H.I.E.L.D.
is supposed to be.

01:52:03.400 --> 01:52:04.811
This is not so bad.

01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:09.411
Let's load them up.

01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:16.165
Sir, we have multiple bogies

01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:18.641
converging on our starboard flank.

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:20.206
Show 'em what we got.

01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:21.561
You're up.

01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:27.841
Yes!

01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:29.844
Now this is gonna be a good story.

01:52:32.480 --> 01:52:34.562
Yup. If you live to tell it.

01:52:34.720 --> 01:52:36.722
You think
I can't hold my own?

01:52:36.840 --> 01:52:38.496
We get through this, I'll hold your own.

01:52:38.520 --> 01:52:40.363
You had to make it weird.

01:52:45.200 --> 01:52:48.170
I got about 50 to 100 more
coming in after this group.

01:53:05.120 --> 01:53:06.531
Here we go. Here we go. Let's move.

01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:08.200
Let's go, everyone!

01:53:10.480 --> 01:53:12.482
Number six boat is topped and locked...

01:53:12.600 --> 01:53:15.001
Or stocked... Topped...

01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:16.965
It's full of people.

01:53:18.720 --> 01:53:19.801
Incoming!

01:53:22.840 --> 01:53:23.887
Oh, God!

01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:35.920
<i>You think
you're saving anyone?</i>

01:53:37.520 --> 01:53:39.522
I turn that key and drop
this rock a little early

01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:41.762
and it's still billions dead.

01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:43.401
Even you can't stop that.

01:53:43.560 --> 01:53:45.961
I am Thor, son of Odin,

01:53:46.080 --> 01:53:48.401
and as long as
there is life in my breast...

01:53:48.520 --> 01:53:52.081
I am running out of things to say!
Are you ready?

01:53:59.760 --> 01:54:01.216
It's terribly well-balanced.

01:54:01.240 --> 01:54:04.722
Well, if there's too much weight,
you lose power on the swing, so...

01:54:05.680 --> 01:54:08.331
I got it. Create a heat seal.

01:54:08.760 --> 01:54:09.856
I could...

01:54:09.880 --> 01:54:12.281
I could supercharge
the spire from below.

01:54:12.440 --> 01:54:13.487
<i>Running numbers.</i>

01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:25.520
<i>A heat seal could work
with enough power.</i>

01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:27.762
- Thor, I got a plan.
- <i>We're out of time.</i>

01:54:27.960 --> 01:54:29.166
<i>They're coming for the core.</i>

01:54:29.280 --> 01:54:31.089
Rhodey, get the rest of the people
on board that carrier.

01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:34.449
- On it.
- Avengers, time to work for a living.

01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:44.800
- Are you good?
- Yeah.

01:54:46.280 --> 01:54:47.327
Romanoff.

01:54:47.480 --> 01:54:49.936
You and Banner better not be
playing "hide the zucchini."

01:54:49.960 --> 01:54:51.041
<i>Relax, shellhead.</i>

01:54:51.440 --> 01:54:52.885
Not all of us can fly.

01:54:58.640 --> 01:55:00.324
- What's the drill?
- This is the drill.

01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:02.642
If Ultron gets a hand
on the core, we lose.

01:55:07.240 --> 01:55:09.242
Is that the best you can do?

01:55:19.120 --> 01:55:20.690
You had to ask.

01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:23.121
This is the best I can do.

01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:24.890
This is exactly what I wanted.

01:55:25.240 --> 01:55:26.571
All of you

01:55:26.680 --> 01:55:28.330
against all of me.

01:55:28.600 --> 01:55:30.807
How can you possibly hope to stop me?

01:55:31.680 --> 01:55:33.523
Well, like the old man said...

01:55:34.840 --> 01:55:35.841
Together.

01:57:04.760 --> 01:57:07.161
You know, with the benefit of hindsight...

01:57:16.440 --> 01:57:17.441
They'll try to leave the city.

01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:19.284
We can't let them,
not even one. Rhodey.

01:57:19.640 --> 01:57:20.721
I'm on it.

01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:22.600
Oh, no. I didn't say you could leave.

01:57:23.120 --> 01:57:25.202
War Machine coming at you! Right...

01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:32.965
Okay, what?

01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:35.202
We gotta move out.
Even I can tell the air is getting thin.

01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:36.646
You guys get to the boats.

01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:38.640
I'll sweep for stragglers.
Be right behind you.

01:57:38.800 --> 01:57:41.246
- What about the core?
- I'll protect it.

01:57:43.040 --> 01:57:44.201
It's my job.

01:57:45.320 --> 01:57:46.481
Nat.

01:57:46.760 --> 01:57:47.761
This way.

01:57:52.160 --> 01:57:53.321
Get the people on the boats.

01:57:53.480 --> 01:57:54.481
I'm not going to leave you here.

01:57:54.640 --> 01:57:55.687
I can handle this.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:57:59.240
Come back for me
when everyone else is off.

01:57:59.480 --> 01:58:00.970
Not before.

01:58:01.600 --> 01:58:02.726
You understand?

01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:05.444
You know,
I'm 12 minutes older than you.

01:58:05.840 --> 01:58:06.921
Go.

01:58:08.480 --> 01:58:10.005
<i>Boss,
power levels are way below...</i>

01:58:10.120 --> 01:58:12.282
Reroute everything.
We get one shot at this.

01:58:17.240 --> 01:58:18.560
I know what I need to do.

01:58:18.840 --> 01:58:19.887
The dining room.

01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:21.366
If I knock out that east wall,

01:58:22.080 --> 01:58:23.720
it'd make a nice workspace
for Laura, huh?

01:58:25.200 --> 01:58:26.361
Put up some baffling.

01:58:26.480 --> 01:58:28.776
She can't hear the kids running around.
What do you think?

01:58:28.800 --> 01:58:29.881
You guys always eat
in the kitchen anyway.

01:58:30.040 --> 01:58:31.565
No one eats in a dining room.

01:58:37.240 --> 01:58:38.360
We don't have a lot of time.

01:58:38.960 --> 01:58:40.928
So get your ass on a boat.

01:58:53.880 --> 01:58:55.006
Hey, big guy.

01:58:56.800 --> 01:58:58.564
Sun's getting real low.

01:58:59.080 --> 01:59:01.731
You're safe now.
You're gonna be okay. Buckle up.

01:59:04.280 --> 01:59:05.850
Secure your gear, find a seat.

01:59:05.960 --> 01:59:07.246
Costel!

01:59:08.320 --> 01:59:09.446
We were in the market.

01:59:09.560 --> 01:59:10.607
Costel!

01:59:25.320 --> 01:59:27.368
Thor, I'm gonna
need you back in the church.

01:59:27.480 --> 01:59:28.925
- Is this the last of them?
- Yeah.

01:59:29.360 --> 01:59:31.920
- Everyone else is on the carrier.
- <i>You know, this works,</i>

01:59:32.240 --> 01:59:33.651
we maybe don't walk away.

01:59:34.360 --> 01:59:35.361
Maybe not.

01:59:54.600 --> 01:59:58.127
<i>I got no strings, so I have fun.</i>

01:59:58.600 --> 02:00:01.285
<i>I'm not tied up to anyone.</i>

02:00:02.880 --> 02:00:04.211
Come on. Time to go.

02:00:36.640 --> 02:00:38.688
You didn't see that coming?

02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:36.724
Oh, for God's sake.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:54.764
- Zrinka!
- Costel! Baby!

02:02:07.240 --> 02:02:08.241
No, no, I'm fine.

02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:09.401
Fine.

02:02:11.240 --> 02:02:13.288
It's been a long day.

02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:29.046
Wanda.

02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:33.003
If you stay here, you'll die.

02:02:34.600 --> 02:02:35.965
I just did.

02:02:36.760 --> 02:02:38.524
Do you know how it felt?

02:02:52.600 --> 02:02:54.967
It felt like that.

02:03:29.960 --> 02:03:31.610
Thor, on my mark.

02:03:46.680 --> 02:03:47.681
Now!

02:04:15.680 --> 02:04:18.126
<i>Hey, big guy. We did it.</i>

02:04:19.160 --> 02:04:20.844
<i>The job is finished.</i>

02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:23.725
<i>Now I need you to turn
this bird around, okay?</i>

02:04:28.040 --> 02:04:29.849
We can't track you in stealth mode.

02:04:31.960 --> 02:04:34.088
<i>So help me out. I need you...</i>

02:05:19.760 --> 02:05:20.761
You're afraid.

02:05:21.760 --> 02:05:22.841
Of you?

02:05:23.520 --> 02:05:24.681
Of death.

02:05:25.400 --> 02:05:27.209
You're the last one.

02:05:27.440 --> 02:05:29.886
You were supposed to be the last.

02:05:30.120 --> 02:05:32.407
Stark asked for a saviour

02:05:33.440 --> 02:05:35.124
and settled for a slave.

02:05:35.240 --> 02:05:37.641
I suppose we are both disappointments.

02:05:40.120 --> 02:05:41.360
I suppose we are.

02:05:42.080 --> 02:05:43.241
Humans are odd.

02:05:45.080 --> 02:05:48.721
They think order and chaos
are somehow opposites

02:05:50.480 --> 02:05:51.811
and try to control what won't be.

02:05:53.520 --> 02:05:55.966
But there is grace in their failings.

02:05:56.280 --> 02:05:58.203
I think you missed that.

02:05:58.880 --> 02:05:59.961
They're doomed.

02:06:00.880 --> 02:06:01.927
Yes.

02:06:06.160 --> 02:06:09.084
But a thing isn't beautiful
because it lasts.

02:06:11.160 --> 02:06:13.162
It's a privilege to be among them.

02:06:13.400 --> 02:06:15.926
You're unbearably naive.

02:06:16.200 --> 02:06:17.406
Well...

02:06:19.480 --> 02:06:21.528
I was born yesterday.

02:07:34.160 --> 02:07:36.242
<i>Look! Say hi to Auntie Nat!</i>

02:07:37.600 --> 02:07:38.601
Fat.

02:07:39.720 --> 02:07:41.280
One of our tech boys
flagged this.

02:07:42.200 --> 02:07:44.362
Splashed down in the Banda Sea.

02:07:45.480 --> 02:07:47.005
Could be the Quinjet.

02:07:47.360 --> 02:07:49.044
But with Stark's stealth tech,

02:07:49.160 --> 02:07:50.730
we still can't track the damn thing.

02:07:52.280 --> 02:07:53.645
Right.

02:07:54.080 --> 02:07:56.321
Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji.

02:07:57.600 --> 02:07:59.489
He'll send a postcard.

02:07:59.760 --> 02:08:01.489
"Wish you were here."

02:08:03.440 --> 02:08:06.728
You sent me to recruit him
way back when.

02:08:08.560 --> 02:08:11.131
Did you know then
what was gonna happen?

02:08:13.320 --> 02:08:15.243
You never know.

02:08:15.440 --> 02:08:18.967
You hope for the best,
then make do with what you get.

02:08:19.440 --> 02:08:20.930
I got a great team.

02:08:22.040 --> 02:08:24.008
Nothing lasts forever.

02:08:24.280 --> 02:08:26.328
Trouble, Ms. Romanoff.

02:08:26.560 --> 02:08:29.928
No matter who wins or loses,
trouble still comes around.

02:08:33.800 --> 02:08:35.040
<i>The rules have changed.</i>

02:08:35.200 --> 02:08:36.804
We're dealing
with something new.

02:08:36.960 --> 02:08:38.246
Oh, the Vision is artificial intelligence.

02:08:38.360 --> 02:08:40.283
- A machine.
- So, it doesn't count?

02:08:40.480 --> 02:08:42.289
No, it's not like
a person lifting the hammer.

02:08:42.560 --> 02:08:44.210
Right, different rules for us.

02:08:44.440 --> 02:08:45.487
- Nice guy. Artificial.
- Thank you.

02:08:45.680 --> 02:08:48.570
He can wield the hammer,
he can keep the Mind Stone.

02:08:49.480 --> 02:08:51.562
It's safe with the Vision.

02:08:51.800 --> 02:08:54.326
And these days, safe is in short supply.

02:08:56.360 --> 02:08:58.328
But if you put the hammer
in an elevator...

02:08:58.440 --> 02:09:00.336
- It would still go up.
- Elevator's not worthy.

02:09:00.360 --> 02:09:02.169
I'm gonna miss these little talks of ours.

02:09:02.320 --> 02:09:03.845
Not if you don't leave.

02:09:04.080 --> 02:09:05.809
I have no choice.

02:09:06.040 --> 02:09:08.202
The Mind Stone
is the fourth of the Infinity Stones

02:09:08.320 --> 02:09:09.731
to show up in the last few years.

02:09:09.840 --> 02:09:11.410
It's not a coincidence.

02:09:12.240 --> 02:09:14.004
Someone has been playing
an intricate game

02:09:14.160 --> 02:09:15.810
and has made pawns of us.

02:09:15.920 --> 02:09:17.809
And once all these pieces
are in position...

02:09:17.920 --> 02:09:19.331
Triple Yahtzee.

02:09:19.560 --> 02:09:21.005
You think you can find out
what's coming?

02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:22.201
I do.

02:09:23.040 --> 02:09:24.530
Besides this one,

02:09:24.640 --> 02:09:27.007
there's nothing that can't be explained.

02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:36.846
That man has no regard
for lawn maintenance.

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.606
I'm gonna miss him, though.
And you're gonna miss me.

02:09:42.720 --> 02:09:44.290
There's gonna be a lot of manful tears.

02:09:46.480 --> 02:09:48.130
I will miss you, Tony.

02:09:48.360 --> 02:09:49.361
Yeah?

02:09:49.520 --> 02:09:51.966
Well, it's time for me to tap out.

02:09:52.200 --> 02:09:54.362
Maybe I should
take a page out of Barton's book.

02:09:54.520 --> 02:09:57.444
Build Pepper a farm,
hope nobody blows it up.

02:09:58.240 --> 02:09:59.401
The simple life.

02:09:59.680 --> 02:10:01.967
- You'll get there one day.
- I don't know.

02:10:02.200 --> 02:10:04.601
Family, stability...

02:10:05.760 --> 02:10:08.889
The guy who wanted all that
went in the ice 75 years ago.

02:10:10.400 --> 02:10:12.243
I think someone else came out.

02:10:16.200 --> 02:10:17.281
You all right?

02:10:19.960 --> 02:10:21.405
I'm home.

02:10:29.320 --> 02:10:32.085
You wanna keep staring at the wall,
or do you wanna go to work?

02:10:32.240 --> 02:10:33.571
I mean, it's a pretty interesting wall.

02:10:33.760 --> 02:10:36.816
I thought you and Tony
were still gazing into each other's eyes.

02:10:36.840 --> 02:10:37.887
How do we look?

02:10:38.120 --> 02:10:40.407
Well, we're not the '27 Yankees.

02:10:40.560 --> 02:10:42.244
We got some hitters.

02:10:42.400 --> 02:10:44.801
They're good. They're not a team.

02:10:44.960 --> 02:10:46.610
Let's beat them into shape.

02:11:05.080 --> 02:11:06.605
Avengers...

02:13:25.440 --> 02:13:26.885
Fine.

02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:30.163
I'll do it myself.

02:13:30.263 --> 02:13:35.263
