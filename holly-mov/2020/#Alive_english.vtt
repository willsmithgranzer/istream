00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:28.671
Oh, shit.

00:58:28.755 --> 00:58:29.797
Shit!

00:58:29.881 --> 00:58:30.798
Hello?

00:58:31.925 --> 00:58:32.884
Still asleep?

00:58:33.927 --> 00:58:35.553
Can you hear me?

00:58:37.055 --> 00:58:37.972
I can hear you.

00:58:38.848 --> 00:58:40.892
-[sighs]
-Hello.

00:58:40.975 --> 00:58:41.809
Yes, hello!

00:58:42.727 --> 00:58:44.103
Shh. Softer, please.

00:58:45.271 --> 00:58:47.106
[whispering]
Right. Yeah, absolutely.

00:58:48.566 --> 00:58:49.817
I'm just…

00:58:50.318 --> 00:58:51.528
I'm just so excited.

00:58:51.611 --> 00:58:52.737
This is so cool!

00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:55.031
You don't have to whisper,
just so you know.

00:58:55.740 --> 00:58:56.699
Oh, right.

00:58:57.992 --> 00:58:58.910
That bag you sent.

00:58:58.993 --> 00:58:59.827
[Jun-u] What?

00:58:59.911 --> 00:59:02.247
[Yu-bin] The… Nutella.

00:59:02.330 --> 00:59:03.289
Can you hear me?

00:59:03.373 --> 00:59:04.749
Nutella.

00:59:05.416 --> 00:59:07.210
Hello? Hello?

00:59:07.293 --> 00:59:08.378
Hello?

00:59:09.337 --> 00:59:11.214
Don't press the button when I talk.

00:59:11.297 --> 00:59:12.590
What?

00:59:13.424 --> 00:59:14.259
The button.

00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:17.345
Don't press the button when I'm talking.

00:59:18.012 --> 00:59:19.097
Oh…

00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:22.517
Right, I knew that. Makes sense

00:59:23.935 --> 00:59:25.144
Thank you for the food.

00:59:26.145 --> 00:59:27.480
Hmm. Sure.

00:59:27.981 --> 00:59:30.984
Well, do you like Nutella?

00:59:34.028 --> 00:59:35.113
Hmm…

00:59:37.699 --> 00:59:38.658
kinda.

00:59:39.659 --> 00:59:41.369
What, why'd I send it to her then?

00:59:43.580 --> 00:59:44.831
I can hear you, you know.

00:59:46.249 --> 00:59:47.375
[groans]
I'm an idiot.

00:59:48.835 --> 00:59:50.712
I can still hear you, you know?

00:59:51.671 --> 00:59:52.714
[sighs]

00:59:57.427 --> 00:59:58.803
Thank you for the food.

00:59:59.637 --> 01:00:00.888
I really enjoyed it.

01:00:04.183 --> 01:00:05.268
I should thank you.

01:00:05.810 --> 01:00:06.936
For saving me.

01:00:07.937 --> 01:00:09.147
Thank you so much.

01:00:13.526 --> 01:00:14.902
I didn't save you.

01:00:16.154 --> 01:00:17.363
What?

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:18.906
I said, I didn't save you.

01:00:20.074 --> 01:00:22.410
You saved yourself
because you wanted to live.

01:00:26.372 --> 01:00:29.292
Your eagerness to live
is what's keeping you alive.

01:00:30.168 --> 01:00:32.086
[Jun-u] Yeah, but still…

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:34.130
Without you…

01:00:35.715 --> 01:00:37.091
If I'd never met you,

01:00:38.593 --> 01:00:40.345
I wouldn't be here now.

01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:42.639
I nearly died.

01:00:42.722 --> 01:00:45.308
I mean, I… I almost killed myself,
you know.

01:00:47.518 --> 01:00:48.853
I'm so sorry to hear that,

01:00:49.979 --> 01:00:51.564
but can we talk about something else?

01:00:52.106 --> 01:00:53.191
What?

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:57.028
If it's alright with you…

01:00:58.946 --> 01:01:01.616
I'd love to talk about something,
just anything.

01:01:06.204 --> 01:01:07.914
Want to make noodles?

01:01:11.376 --> 01:01:12.502
Did you drain them?

01:01:14.337 --> 01:01:16.047
There's only a little water.

01:01:16.964 --> 01:01:19.884
You have to control the amount
of water and simmer it down.

01:01:19.967 --> 01:01:20.968
Simmer it down?

01:01:21.052 --> 01:01:22.845
If you want to mix it with rice later…

01:01:22.929 --> 01:01:24.597
What do you mean mix it later?

01:01:25.890 --> 01:01:27.767
-Do you know how to cook noodles?
-[scoffs]

01:01:28.267 --> 01:01:30.687
Who doesn't know how to cook noodles?

01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:33.940
[sighs]
Well, you obviously don't know how.

01:01:34.023 --> 01:01:36.818
Why wouldn't she pour out the water?
She's weird.

01:01:42.281 --> 01:01:45.660
Chapagetti. I think Chapagetti
tastes the best

01:01:45.743 --> 01:01:47.495
when mixed with Neoguri. Right?

01:01:47.578 --> 01:01:49.789
NEOGURI

01:01:49.872 --> 01:01:50.957
[clears throat]

01:01:53.418 --> 01:01:55.128
That's way too much food for me.

01:01:55.837 --> 01:01:57.296
You can't even finish that?

01:02:00.299 --> 01:02:01.300
Eat up, neighbor.

01:02:01.384 --> 01:02:03.594
Yes, yes, I'm going to right now.

01:02:06.431 --> 01:02:08.307
[Jun-u] Oh… Oh, my.

01:02:08.391 --> 01:02:11.352
I wish I could top it off
with a sesame oil.

01:02:19.152 --> 01:02:21.195
[laughs]
You're scared of heights?

01:02:21.279 --> 01:02:23.656
What? What's wrong with that?

01:02:24.615 --> 01:02:27.285
Well, it just doesn't suit you.

01:02:29.287 --> 01:02:32.248
You cut off someone's hand,
yet you're scared of heights?

01:02:36.335 --> 01:02:37.837
I never cut off anyone's hand.

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:38.796
What?

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:40.423
Those monsters aren't human.

01:02:41.549 --> 01:02:42.675
Not anymore.

01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:47.680
I am afraid of heights.

01:02:48.639 --> 01:02:50.349
I fell while climbing as a kid.

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:52.810
Climbing?

01:02:54.145 --> 01:02:57.148
As in climbing as deep cliff
in the mountains with bare hands

01:02:57.690 --> 01:02:59.400
like Tom Cruise in MI3?

01:02:59.484 --> 01:03:01.986
Well, I'm not that good.

01:03:05.239 --> 01:03:09.035
[scoffs]
Tom Cruise, really? You sound ancient.

01:03:09.118 --> 01:03:10.411
[rumbling]

01:03:10.495 --> 01:03:12.455
Oh, it's raining! We need rainwater.

01:03:12.538 --> 01:03:13.998
Get a bowl. No, a pail!

01:03:14.665 --> 01:03:15.583
A pail?

01:03:18.461 --> 01:03:19.295
[sighs]

01:03:22.465 --> 01:03:24.759

01:03:26.636 --> 01:03:27.762

01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:31.951
They're coming straight to my apartment.

They're outside the door.

01:04:53.639 --> 01:04:55.224
What am I gonna do now?

01:04:58.895 --> 01:04:59.770
Which unit?

01:05:00.688 --> 01:05:02.064
-What?
-What unit?

Are you ready?

01:05:42.063 --> 01:05:42.980
By the way,

01:05:44.315 --> 01:05:45.983
are you sure no one's out there?

01:05:49.862 --> 01:05:51.030
Yes, I'm sure.

01:05:51.113 --> 01:05:53.658
It's gotta be the eighth floor.
It's vacant.

01:05:53.741 --> 01:05:56.577
Yu-bin. Even if it isn't empty…

01:05:59.121 --> 01:06:01.165
it's okay with me because…

01:06:01.248 --> 01:06:04.210
whether we get eaten by them or starve,
we all die someday.

01:06:07.421 --> 01:06:08.631
Never mind.

01:06:08.714 --> 01:06:09.632
What?

01:06:10.174 --> 01:06:12.343
I'm coming. I'm leaving now.

01:06:17.014 --> 01:06:19.016
[tense music playing]

01:06:22.019 --> 01:06:23.396

01:06:46.627 --> 01:06:47.795
You there?

01:06:50.464 --> 01:06:52.174
Do you think we can survive this?

01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:00.683
I'm not sure.

01:07:05.521 --> 01:07:06.897
But I want to.

01:07:10.067 --> 01:07:12.153
I really want to get through this shit.

01:07:14.822 --> 01:07:18.242
I don't wanna be torn to shreds
by those rotting creatures.

01:07:19.035 --> 01:07:22.496
And believe me, I don't want to
be fucking eaten alive either.

01:07:25.124 --> 01:07:26.417
We have to survive.

01:07:27.626 --> 01:07:28.878
We'll survive together.

01:07:31.756 --> 01:07:32.757
All right, then.

01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:41.057
I'll get down there first
and distract them. That's your cue.

One, two.

[banging on door]

01:12:14.163 --> 01:12:16.457
Okay. We're good.

01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:17.666
We're good now.

01:12:18.751 --> 01:12:19.960
Jesus, relax.

01:12:24.506 --> 01:12:25.966
Guys.

01:12:26.050 --> 01:12:29.345
You don't need to thank me,

01:12:29.428 --> 01:12:30.596
but that thing…

01:12:30.679 --> 01:12:32.765
Could you ask her to put that thing away?

01:12:34.099 --> 01:12:35.225
-Let's just--
-[grunts]

01:12:35.309 --> 01:12:36.268
-[gasps]
-All right.

01:12:36.352 --> 01:12:38.729
Who are you? Why did you help us?

01:12:39.813 --> 01:12:40.731
Well…

01:12:41.357 --> 01:12:43.942
Aren't you the one who pleaded for help?

01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:49.990
I really thought
the eighth floor was empty.

01:12:53.202 --> 01:12:54.161
Shh…

01:12:57.581 --> 01:12:58.665
[survivor] Goodness.

01:12:59.375 --> 01:13:02.711
By the way,
how did you two manage to survive?

01:13:04.004 --> 01:13:06.673
I mean, that's quite impressive, you guys.

01:13:07.424 --> 01:13:11.053
You see, I thought I was the only survivor
in the entire building.

01:13:12.638 --> 01:13:16.517
We thought we were the only survivors
in the complex

01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:17.935
and everyone else was…

01:13:18.018 --> 01:13:19.395
Right, of course.

01:13:20.979 --> 01:13:22.940
But not anymore, you know?

01:13:23.023 --> 01:13:25.734
No, guess not.
[chuckles]

01:13:26.318 --> 01:13:28.737
Oh, by the way, you seem to know a lot.

01:13:29.405 --> 01:13:31.365
I mean, about those things out there.

01:13:31.949 --> 01:13:33.617
[Jun-u] Since I'm still alive,

01:13:34.201 --> 01:13:36.620
I've been stuck at home,
listening to the news.

01:13:36.703 --> 01:13:37.913
[survivor] Same here.

01:13:38.539 --> 01:13:41.333
But why were you guys together?
You know each other?

01:13:41.417 --> 01:13:43.794
[Jun-u] Not really.
We didn't know before this.

01:13:43.877 --> 01:13:45.337
We met four days ago.

01:13:45.421 --> 01:13:46.672
Hmm.

01:13:46.755 --> 01:13:49.216
You've been hunkering down here
all by yourself?

01:13:49.299 --> 01:13:50.426
[survivor] Right.

01:13:51.802 --> 01:13:52.928
Anyway…

01:13:55.472 --> 01:13:57.724
Aren't you guys thirsty? Have some water.

01:13:59.685 --> 01:14:00.519
What's wrong?

01:14:01.019 --> 01:14:03.355
Right, I… I get it.

01:14:04.982 --> 01:14:09.236
With everything that's been going on,
no wonder you've been careful.

01:14:17.411 --> 01:14:18.495
Ahh.

01:14:21.165 --> 01:14:22.583
Drink it. It's all good.

01:14:26.753 --> 01:14:28.547
-[sips]
-You guys must be hungry.

01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:30.007
Do you want some food?

01:14:30.090 --> 01:14:31.133
Yeah?

01:14:34.845 --> 01:14:35.971
Spam.

01:14:39.349 --> 01:14:40.601
[both moaning]

01:14:43.854 --> 01:14:45.481
So? Do you guys like it?

01:14:46.064 --> 01:14:46.940
Yes.

01:14:47.024 --> 01:14:48.150
This is amazing.

01:14:49.610 --> 01:14:50.444
I'm glad.

01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:54.948
-[coughs]
-Slow down. Eat slowly.

01:14:55.032 --> 01:14:56.909
Okay, thank you so much.

01:14:57.826 --> 01:15:01.163
There's enough food for us to last
until the rescue team arrives.

01:15:02.498 --> 01:15:03.332
Rescue?

01:15:03.415 --> 01:15:05.000
-Seriously?
-Rescue team?

01:15:06.668 --> 01:15:08.045
You didn't hear the news?

01:15:08.629 --> 01:15:10.339
Isn't that why you came up here?

01:15:11.965 --> 01:15:13.634
You heard it? On the news?

01:15:14.259 --> 01:15:16.345
I can catch the signal from time to time.

01:15:17.554 --> 01:15:19.389
You guys really didn't hear it?

Uh, yeah.

01:15:37.950 --> 01:15:39.868
We need to hold out a little longer.

01:15:41.912 --> 01:15:42.996
Wow.

01:15:45.499 --> 01:15:47.000
[chuckles]

01:15:49.461 --> 01:15:52.756
By the way,
how did you stay hidden for so long?

01:15:55.884 --> 01:15:57.261
Hiding is easy, you know.

01:15:59.429 --> 01:16:02.599
I had to hide whenever I smoked
because of my wife. That helped.

01:16:02.683 --> 01:16:03.976
[chuckles]

01:16:15.988 --> 01:16:18.865

[Jun-u mumbles]

01:16:22.578 --> 01:16:23.453
Nope.

01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:26.873
But you two kids arrived today.

01:16:28.792 --> 01:16:29.793

if it weren't for you?

The fact that we're still alive

01:20:13.308 --> 01:20:14.601
means that you and I…

[reporter 5] Impossible to know
how many people are infected,

01:31:58.971 --> 01:32:01.224
but the authorities speculate
that at least 50,000

01:32:01.307 --> 01:32:03.684
are infected across the country.

01:32:03.768 --> 01:32:06.562
The metropolitan area
was hit especially hard

01:32:06.646 --> 01:32:11.359
due to the compact spacing of rental units
within various apartment complexes.

01:32:11.442 --> 01:32:14.904
Rescue squads are focusing
on locating and extracting survivors

01:32:14.987 --> 01:32:19.909
within the area by tracking SOS messages
posted on social media by civilians.

01:32:19.992 --> 01:32:22.495
Each region's internet
and wireless networks

01:32:22.578 --> 01:32:24.288
have been or are being restored,

01:32:24.372 --> 01:32:27.750
so the SOS messages on social media
have been rather effective.

01:32:27.833 --> 01:32:30.920
Each region's Disaster and Safety
Countermeasures Headquarters

01:32:31.003 --> 01:32:33.965
will promote a campaign
that encourages all survivors

01:32:34.048 --> 01:32:37.051
to post their current locations
on social media.
