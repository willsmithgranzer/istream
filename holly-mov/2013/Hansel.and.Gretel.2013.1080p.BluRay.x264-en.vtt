00:21:52.688 --> 00:21:55.315
So we got this witch
on the ground, right?

00:21:55.399 --> 00:21:59.069
And her eyes, they start rolling back
in her head. They're glowing red.

00:21:59.152 --> 00:22:01.279
She's trying to put
a Soul Searcher spell on me, you see.

00:22:01.363 --> 00:22:03.865
So I slap her and rip out her tongue.

00:22:03.949 --> 00:22:08.829
And she starts pissing, starts pissing
everywhere, (SCOFFS) right?

00:22:08.954 --> 00:22:11.331
But a witch's piss,
it's the worst, you see,

00:22:11.415 --> 00:22:14.626
because it actually burns the ground.
It's like acid.

00:22:15.335 --> 00:22:19.214
Although, in small doses,
it does cure poison ivy, insect bites.

00:22:19.297 --> 00:22:21.258
I'm getting way off the subject, aren't I?

00:22:21.341 --> 00:22:23.969

And on this last one,

00:22:38.108 --> 00:22:40.027
we believe a troll was involved.

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:42.320
- A troll?
- Trolls are extra.

00:22:42.779 --> 00:22:46.033
Hey, so what's wrong with the girls
in this place, huh?

00:22:46.241 --> 00:22:47.367
I mean, correct me if I'm wrong,

00:22:47.451 --> 00:22:49.786
but aren't bar wenches
supposed to be easy?

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:52.956
- It's really unusual.
- Yes, it is unusual.

00:22:53.081 --> 00:22:54.082
Look at this one.

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:56.626
A father and three children attacked.

00:22:57.294 --> 00:22:59.755
One child was taken,
but she didn't touch the other two.

00:22:59.838 --> 00:23:01.548
- Uh-oh.
- That's weird.

00:23:01.673 --> 00:23:02.716
That's so weird.

00:23:02.799 --> 00:23:05.594

- Yeah, yeah.

we hunt witches for a living.

- Oh, my.
-(BEN CHUCKLES)

00:23:28.075 --> 00:23:30.577
Yeah, that's from when you
found the Fox Witch of Antwerp

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:31.787
-and sank her in the moat.
- Oh!

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:34.748
And this one's from the
Secret Witch Ring of Belsen.

00:23:34.831 --> 00:23:37.667
When they tried to put a gate to
hell under the courthouse.

00:23:37.751 --> 00:23:40.420
I mean, you guys, you certainly
taught those witches a thing or two.

All right, well...

00:23:49.262 --> 00:23:51.890

00:23:51.973 --> 00:23:53.517
- You know, we have...
- Oh, no, no.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.268
- You go ahead.
- BEN: All right, um...

00:23:56.895 --> 00:23:59.981
Okay. Um, how do you best kill a witch?

00:24:00.065 --> 00:24:01.149
Hansel?

00:24:02.692 --> 00:24:05.278
Uh, cutting off their heads tends to work.

00:24:05.362 --> 00:24:06.613
Ripping out their hearts.

00:24:06.696 --> 00:24:08.490
And skinning them is also nice.

00:24:08.573 --> 00:24:10.534
Yeah, but burning is the best way.

00:24:10.617 --> 00:24:12.536

witches can't harm you?

Well, no, that is horseshit, son.

Their magic doesn't work on us.

00:24:23.672 --> 00:24:26.258
And they haven't killed us, yet.

00:24:26.341 --> 00:24:27.634
Oh, do you think that's because of

00:24:27.717 --> 00:24:30.053
the witch that you burned
when you were children?

00:24:30.137 --> 00:24:32.472
I guess that's how
it all started for you guys.

00:24:32.556 --> 00:24:34.766

you became witch hunters?
