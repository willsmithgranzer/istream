28:37.416 --> 28:39.708
I just need you to go pick him up
and drop him off at my place.

28:39.791 --> 28:41.083
-Liv.
-Jack.

28:41.166 --> 28:42.583
I'm stuck at work, and Craig's away,

28:42.666 --> 28:45.000

and go pick up your kid.

29:09.458 --> 29:11.583

-What?

29:11.666 --> 29:13.541
No.

29:15.166 --> 29:17.083
[Jack] I got to get
something in my stomach.

-I don't want a churro.
-I heard you. They're for me.

29:32.041 --> 29:33.791
So, what are they saying you did?

29:33.875 --> 29:37.416
Tampered with the school's
attendance records, which I did.

29:37.500 --> 29:39.208
Allegedly.

29:39.291 --> 29:41.083
Never admit that.

29:41.166 --> 29:42.500

29:50.541 --> 29:51.916
Mm-hmm.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.916
I started to ditch science
so I could go and practice guitar,

29:54.000 --> 29:55.166
then I'd change it on the computer.

29:55.250 --> 29:56.666
Makes sense.

29:56.750 --> 29:59.916
There's this girl in jazz band, Piper.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.625
She started to ditch with me,
but then Kevin--

30:02.708 --> 30:03.916
Who's Kevin?

30:04.000 --> 30:05.958
My best friend. At least he was.

30:06.041 --> 30:07.375
What'd Kevin do?

30:07.458 --> 30:09.125
Kevin found out and wanted to ditch, too.

30:09.208 --> 30:10.750
But he's not even in jazz band.

30:10.833 --> 30:12.458
He just wanted to hang out with Piper.

30:12.541 --> 30:14.250
I was the one hanging out with Piper.

30:14.333 --> 30:16.541
So I'm supposed to go in
and change his absent to present

30:16.625 --> 30:19.041
-so he can hang out with Piper?
-It's bullshit.

30:19.125 --> 30:21.125
So, instead,
I gave him three more absents.

30:21.208 --> 30:23.333
Good. Send a message.

30:23.416 --> 30:24.791
He got busted and told the vice principal.

30:24.875 --> 30:26.500
Kevin.

30:27.583 --> 30:29.166
So I slashed the tires on his bike.

30:34.583 --> 30:37.000
-I know, you're disappointed.
-I am disappointed.

30:37.083 --> 30:38.166

30:38.250 --> 30:40.041
Look, if you're gonna hack a mainframe,
you do it quietly.

30:40.125 --> 30:41.583
You go in through a back door,
no fingerprints.

30:41.666 --> 30:44.041
But more importantly,
the second this kid Kevin

30:44.125 --> 30:46.666
knew what you were doing,
you got a loose end.

30:46.750 --> 30:49.833
Never trust anybody. Anybody.

30:49.916 --> 30:53.375
And never let someone get the upper hand
on you, 'cause they'll use it.

30:56.791 --> 30:57.791
Yeah.

31:06.500 --> 31:08.125
All right, I got to go practice.

31:08.208 --> 31:11.208
I have this dumb winter pageant thing
tonight for jazz band.

31:11.291 --> 31:13.500
A pageant? Oof.

31:13.583 --> 31:15.166
I know.

31:15.250 --> 31:17.125

31:25.833 --> 31:28.583
-Thought labor wasn't progressing.
-Yeah, then it did.

31:28.666 --> 31:30.541
Thanks for picking him up, though.

31:30.625 --> 31:33.333
I don't know what's going on
with him these days. He's acting out.

31:33.416 --> 31:35.750
Yeah, well, you know, growing up is tough.

31:35.833 --> 31:37.666
Is that why you're avoiding it?

-Yeah.

31:40.125 --> 31:41.625
Yeah.

31:41.708 --> 31:43.125
He'd really love to see you
more often, Jack.

31:43.208 --> 31:44.583
I just picked him up.

31:44.666 --> 31:46.666
-I know.
-It was really nice. We had a good talk.

31:46.750 --> 31:48.666
He told me about school.
I mean, I don't know what--

31:48.750 --> 31:50.625
He would love that to happen more often,
is all I'm saying.

31:50.708 --> 31:51.958

back in the beginning.

01:09:35.958 --> 01:09:38.916
Red gave gifts to well-behaved children,

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.500
and the brother helped keep track
of who they were.

01:09:41.583 --> 01:09:44.583
Then the brother started making lists.

01:09:44.666 --> 01:09:47.291
And Red was always
uncomfortable with that.

01:09:47.375 --> 01:09:50.833
He didn't like the idea of a running list
of misbehaved children.

01:09:51.958 --> 01:09:54.291
But the brother became obsessed.

01:09:55.583 --> 01:09:59.708

started the Naughty List?

01:09:59.791 --> 01:10:01.833
Yes.

01:17:12.250 --> 01:17:14.500
Callum Drift.

01:17:14.583 --> 01:17:16.000
Lord Krampus.

01:17:17.083 --> 01:17:20.166
The festivities are just beginning,

01:17:20.250 --> 01:17:22.916
but I don't remember inviting you.

01:17:28.041 --> 01:17:31.166
You shouldn't be here.

01:17:31.250 --> 01:17:33.666
You know you shouldn't be here,

01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:36.375
and yet here you are.

01:17:36.458 --> 01:17:38.166
And with a mortal.

01:17:39.416 --> 01:17:41.291
Uh, I'm Jack O'Malley.

01:17:41.375 --> 01:17:42.833
I didn't... I'm not...

01:17:42.916 --> 01:17:45.333
We didn't even... I mean, obviously we...

01:17:45.416 --> 01:17:47.041
I just met him today.

01:17:47.125 --> 01:17:49.166
The big one was armed with this.

01:17:50.250 --> 01:17:52.125
A Northern Vambrace.

01:17:52.208 --> 01:17:53.583
Thank you.

01:17:53.666 --> 01:17:57.125
Just what I wanted for Christmas.

01:17:57.208 --> 01:17:59.333
Krampus, I can explain--

01:17:59.416 --> 01:18:01.750
You're trying to find him,

01:18:01.833 --> 01:18:04.333
and you thought he would be here.

01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:07.583
Well, guess what, Northerner.

01:18:11.166 --> 01:18:12.708
He's not here. [laughs]

01:18:12.791 --> 01:18:14.833
[others join in laughter]

01:18:14.916 --> 01:18:17.875
Last night, he was taken
from the compound by the Witch.

01:18:19.041 --> 01:18:21.208
And I know that she was here not long ago.

01:18:22.416 --> 01:18:25.666
Are you accusing me of something, Drift?

01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:28.708
You and she were partners once.

01:18:28.791 --> 01:18:31.666
Roaming the countryside, the villages.

01:18:31.750 --> 01:18:33.166
Punishing people.

01:18:33.250 --> 01:18:34.916
Yes.

01:18:36.041 --> 01:18:37.666
But back then, she was glorious.

01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:39.000
[laughter]

01:18:39.083 --> 01:18:41.166
An ogre 18 feet high.

01:18:41.250 --> 01:18:43.333
The skin of an elephant.

01:18:43.416 --> 01:18:46.625
Giant pair of tails.

01:18:47.791 --> 01:18:52.041
And yes, punishing as the cruelest winter.

01:18:52.125 --> 01:18:55.958
We had some wonderful times together.

01:18:57.625 --> 01:18:59.708
But I gave up that work, remember?

01:18:59.791 --> 01:19:05.000
I spent 700 years menacing the naughty,

01:19:05.083 --> 01:19:08.041
trying to scare them into decency.

01:19:08.125 --> 01:19:10.000
I did my part!

01:19:11.250 --> 01:19:13.583
The only punishing I do now...

01:19:15.541 --> 01:19:18.333
-...is for fun.
-[laughter]

01:19:18.416 --> 01:19:20.250
Like my good friend over here...

01:19:20.333 --> 01:19:24.500
-[groans softly]
-...enjoying his headache on Krampusnacht.

01:19:24.583 --> 01:19:26.291
But today is not Krampusnacht.

01:19:26.375 --> 01:19:29.333
In this house, Northerner,

01:19:29.416 --> 01:19:33.625
-it is always Krampusnacht!
-[cheering]

01:19:33.708 --> 01:19:35.583
[crowd chanting] Ooh, ooh, ah, ah!
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah!

01:19:35.666 --> 01:19:38.208
-Ah, ah, ah! Ooh, ooh, ah, ah!
-[Krampus shouting]

01:19:38.291 --> 01:19:40.083
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah! Ah, ah, ah!

01:19:40.166 --> 01:19:43.500
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah!
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah! Ah, ah, ah!

01:19:43.583 --> 01:19:45.833
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah! Ooh, ah, ooh, ah!

01:19:45.916 --> 01:19:48.166
-Krampus!
-Ah, ah, ah! Ooh--

01:19:48.250 --> 01:19:49.250
[chanting stops]

01:19:49.333 --> 01:19:50.500
Why was she here?

01:19:51.583 --> 01:19:53.500
-[flame whooshes]
-[goblet shatters]

01:19:53.583 --> 01:19:56.875
Many years ago, she gave me a gift.

01:19:56.958 --> 01:19:59.166
She came because she wanted it back.

01:19:59.250 --> 01:20:01.541
A gift? What gift?

01:20:01.625 --> 01:20:03.791
The Glaskäfig.

01:20:03.875 --> 01:20:07.458
On its face, a simple glass snow globe,

01:20:07.541 --> 01:20:11.166
but its true purpose is nefarious.

01:20:11.250 --> 01:20:13.000
Tremendously punishing.

01:20:13.083 --> 01:20:16.041
She wants to punish them all.

01:20:16.125 --> 01:20:19.750
The Glaskäfig is solitude.

01:20:19.833 --> 01:20:22.125
A prison for but one.

01:20:23.208 --> 01:20:24.791
Krampus, I need to find him.

01:20:30.541 --> 01:20:31.750
Let me go.

01:20:33.625 --> 01:20:36.083
And why...

01:20:36.166 --> 01:20:38.166
would I do that?

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.833
Because we need him.

01:20:44.541 --> 01:20:46.541
Now more than ever, we need him.

01:20:47.708 --> 01:20:49.041
And you know that.

01:20:51.541 --> 01:20:53.166
Let me go.

01:21:03.125 --> 01:21:05.125
Northerner.

01:21:05.208 --> 01:21:07.500
You are not going anywhere.

01:21:08.875 --> 01:21:11.541
You, get out.

01:21:11.625 --> 01:21:14.208
And deliver this message
to that MORA scum.

01:21:14.291 --> 01:21:17.583
There is a price for this intrusion.

01:21:17.666 --> 01:21:20.875
Now and forever,

01:21:20.958 --> 01:21:23.208
Drift belongs to me.

01:21:24.708 --> 01:21:26.750
[laughter]

01:21:26.833 --> 01:21:28.708
So I can...

01:21:28.791 --> 01:21:30.500
just walk out of here?

01:21:31.666 --> 01:21:32.833
I suggest you run.

01:21:36.250 --> 01:21:38.958
You'll learn to love it here.

01:21:40.041 --> 01:21:41.708
Take him away.

01:21:41.791 --> 01:21:43.875
[crowd murmuring, laughing]

01:21:43.958 --> 01:21:47.416
Wait. Uh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Uh, sorry. Wait.

01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:49.041
Um, uh, L-Lord... uh, Mister...

01:21:49.125 --> 01:21:51.958
Lord Krampus, um...

01:21:52.041 --> 01:21:53.541
you and I aren't so different.

01:21:58.125 --> 01:22:01.000
We're pretty different, but I think
we have some things in common.

01:22:01.083 --> 01:22:03.416
Ah. Do you, now?

01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:04.708
Yeah.

01:22:04.791 --> 01:22:07.583
I mean, you strike me as a guy
that likes to have a good time.

01:22:07.666 --> 01:22:08.875
Bit of a gambler?

01:22:08.958 --> 01:22:10.375
Well, so am I.

01:22:10.458 --> 01:22:14.833
Now, when we came in here, my man told me
that he thought he could beat you

01:22:14.916 --> 01:22:17.833
at your game, uh, Krampusschlap.

01:22:17.916 --> 01:22:19.833
-What?
-[laughter]

01:22:19.916 --> 01:22:23.000
Now, initially, I said, "No way."

01:22:23.083 --> 01:22:25.833
But the more I see him getting riled up,
I'm starting to like my odds,

01:22:25.916 --> 01:22:28.541
so just hear me out.

01:22:28.625 --> 01:22:31.625
If you win, we go to your dungeon forever.

01:22:31.708 --> 01:22:34.708
If he wins, we walk.

01:22:35.791 --> 01:22:37.750
Unless you don't want to for some reason.

01:22:37.833 --> 01:22:39.583
I mean, I get that. He's a big guy.

01:22:39.666 --> 01:22:41.250
No shame.

01:22:41.333 --> 01:22:42.625
Lot of people watching.

01:22:48.125 --> 01:22:50.583
Imbeciles.

01:22:50.666 --> 01:22:52.750
-I love it.
-[crowd cheering]

01:22:52.833 --> 01:22:54.458
-Oh.
-[crowd chanting] Ooh, ooh, ah, ah!

01:22:54.541 --> 01:22:56.500
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah! Ah, ah, ah!

01:22:56.583 --> 01:22:59.125
[chanting continues in distance]

01:22:59.208 --> 01:23:01.958
-[Ellen clucking wildly]
-[hellhounds barking viciously]

01:23:02.041 --> 01:23:03.458
[bell dinging]

01:23:03.541 --> 01:23:06.000
[cheering]

01:23:06.083 --> 01:23:08.708
Smack the shit out of that goat.

01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:15.250
[cheering dies down]

01:23:17.458 --> 01:23:20.291
The rules are as follows:

01:23:20.375 --> 01:23:23.708
The contestants
will exchange blows in turn.

01:23:23.791 --> 01:23:27.500
The first to be knocked out or die loses.

01:23:33.041 --> 01:23:34.541
First touch.

01:23:34.625 --> 01:23:36.250
That's you.

01:23:36.333 --> 01:23:37.875
[sighs]

01:23:37.958 --> 01:23:39.958
[quiet, tense music playing]

01:23:47.875 --> 01:23:50.500
You know, I really wish there was
another way that we could do this.

01:23:50.583 --> 01:23:52.541
-[crowd groaning]
-Come on.

01:23:52.625 --> 01:23:54.416
I'm sure you do.

01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:57.916
He's still your brother.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.625
And he never gave up on you.

01:24:00.708 --> 01:24:02.041
What would you know about it?

01:24:02.125 --> 01:24:03.958
I know him.

01:24:07.541 --> 01:24:09.625
Take your best "schlap."

01:24:15.625 --> 01:24:18.250
[tense music building]

01:24:18.333 --> 01:24:19.875
[yells]

01:24:20.958 --> 01:24:23.333
[crowd murmuring]

01:24:25.583 --> 01:24:27.000
Interesting.

01:24:28.416 --> 01:24:29.500
My turn.

01:24:29.583 --> 01:24:32.250
[cheering]

01:24:32.333 --> 01:24:34.208
[grunts]

01:24:36.333 --> 01:24:38.583
I could be merciful

01:24:38.666 --> 01:24:41.291
and kill him on the first touch.

01:24:41.375 --> 01:24:44.500
But what fun would that be, huh?
[chuckles]

01:24:44.583 --> 01:24:47.250
[laughter]

01:24:49.625 --> 01:24:51.708
[Callum exhales sharply]

01:24:53.125 --> 01:24:54.750
[growls]

01:24:55.833 --> 01:24:57.250
Oh, my God.

01:24:57.333 --> 01:24:59.958
[tense music building]

01:25:06.833 --> 01:25:08.458

01:25:10.291 --> 01:25:11.916
[groaning]

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.750
Hey, buddy. You okay?

01:25:13.833 --> 01:25:15.750
He just slapped the shit out of me.

01:25:15.833 --> 01:25:17.125
Yeah, that was so embarrassing.

01:25:17.208 --> 01:25:20.166
I love this game!

01:25:20.250 --> 01:25:22.291
I can't... I can't beat him.
He's a winter demigod. I--

01:25:22.375 --> 01:25:23.875
[Jack] Just get up. Trust me.

01:25:23.958 --> 01:25:25.875
[whimpering] I can't...

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.250
Second touch.

01:25:36.375 --> 01:25:38.125
Oh. Sorry.

01:25:38.208 --> 01:25:39.750

[grunting, panting]

01:25:42.250 --> 01:25:44.541
Let me make it easier for you.

01:25:47.250 --> 01:25:48.250
[scattered laughter]

01:25:48.333 --> 01:25:49.833
Come on.

[grunts]

01:25:53.333 --> 01:25:54.708
Come on.

01:25:58.583 --> 01:25:59.875
Come on.

01:25:59.958 --> 01:26:02.166
[tense music building]

01:26:03.250 --> 01:26:05.000

[dramatic music playing]

01:26:20.125 --> 01:26:21.500
Cover us.

01:27:24.625 --> 01:27:26.541
[laughs]

01:27:26.625 --> 01:27:28.500
I thought I had some shady friends.

01:27:28.583 --> 01:27:30.791
[both laughing]

01:27:30.875 --> 01:27:32.458
I can't believe that worked.

01:27:32.541 --> 01:27:34.833
Yeah, sorry about that.
It's all I could come up with.

01:27:34.916 --> 01:27:36.416
No, it was great.

01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:38.125
Oh.

01:27:39.416 --> 01:27:40.833
I misjudged you.

01:27:40.916 --> 01:27:42.875
[laughs]

01:27:42.958 --> 01:27:45.750
Not what you'd expect
from a Class Four Naughty Lister, right?

01:27:45.833 --> 01:27:47.041
Well, it's Level Four.

01:27:47.125 --> 01:27:48.750
-Ah.
-But that's what I'm saying.

01:27:48.833 --> 01:27:51.208
You could've left, but you didn't.

01:27:52.750 --> 01:27:54.166
Thank you.

01:27:55.458 --> 01:27:57.791
[sighs] All right.

01:27:57.875 --> 01:27:59.666
Should we go find your guy?

01:28:00.750 --> 01:28:02.833
Let's save Christmas.

01:28:04.583 --> 01:28:06.208
Right.

01:28:06.291 --> 01:28:07.250
Say it.

01:28:07.333 --> 01:28:09.208

01:37:57.041 --> 01:38:00.625
I know it's a lot of work,
and I hope it's not too late.

01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:08.791
Every day,
every decision is an opportunity.

01:38:11.666 --> 01:38:13.500
And I want to start taking some of those.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.958
So I'm not asking you to believe me.

01:38:17.041 --> 01:38:20.625
I'm just asking for you to...
give me a chance.

01:38:22.041 --> 01:38:24.541
I know I may never be
the greatest father in the world,

01:38:24.625 --> 01:38:27.291
but I know I can do better,

01:38:27.375 --> 01:38:30.833
and I'm telling you right now
that I promise

01:38:30.916 --> 01:38:33.125
I will never stop trying.

01:38:33.208 --> 01:38:35.208

01:38:56.708 --> 01:38:59.125
[sighs]

01:38:59.208 --> 01:39:01.208
What just happened?

01:39:04.916 --> 01:39:07.000
I think I just got a little bit nicer.

01:39:08.125 --> 01:39:10.541
-Can we get out of here?
-Yeah.

01:39:10.625 --> 01:39:13.333
First, we got to find somebody. Come on.

01:39:13.416 --> 01:39:15.416

01:39:20.583 --> 01:39:22.250

01:39:22.333 --> 01:39:23.333
Ow.

01:39:23.416 --> 01:39:25.291
[sighs] Cal.

01:39:26.833 --> 01:39:30.000
If you could make any toy in the world
real right now, what would it be?

01:39:31.375 --> 01:39:32.750
Wonder Woman.

01:39:32.833 --> 01:39:34.000
It's him.

01:39:34.083 --> 01:39:35.250
You all right?

01:39:35.333 --> 01:39:37.375
Yeah. Yeah.

01:39:37.458 --> 01:39:38.916
It's good to see you.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:40.916
[Dylan] Dad?

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.291
[Jack] Buddy, come here.

01:39:43.375 --> 01:39:44.791
I want you to meet some friends.

01:39:44.875 --> 01:39:47.958
Cal, Zoe, this is my son Dylan.

01:39:48.041 --> 01:39:49.833
The one and only Dylan.

01:39:49.916 --> 01:39:51.250
Your dad's told me so much about you.

01:39:53.416 --> 01:39:54.916
Welcome to the North Pole.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.250
Huh?

01:39:57.333 --> 01:40:00.000
I can't believe she got
the old Quatuplicator back online again.

01:40:00.083 --> 01:40:01.833
This thing has been out of commission
since the late 1800s.

01:40:01.916 --> 01:40:04.250
This thing was cranking out snow globes
like rat turds,

01:40:04.333 --> 01:40:06.250
and it just stopped
like somebody pulled the plug.

01:40:06.333 --> 01:40:07.416
Cal, we saw her.

01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:09.500
She said she was
gonna do the ride herself.

01:40:09.583 --> 01:40:11.375
-What?
-Deliver one of these snow globes

01:40:11.458 --> 01:40:12.541
to everybody on the list.

01:40:12.625 --> 01:40:15.291
That's impossible.
The sleigh won't lift off.

01:40:15.375 --> 01:40:16.541
Without him.

01:40:16.625 --> 01:40:18.125
We can't let that sleigh take off.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.750
There's a subterranean access point
to the hangar.

01:40:21.833 --> 01:40:23.333
-[faint shouting]
-[muffled banging]

01:40:23.416 --> 01:40:24.500

Ma'am.

01:41:28.041 --> 01:41:29.791

01:45:21.750 --> 01:45:23.708
No way, man.

01:45:23.791 --> 01:45:26.083
For a guy like me,
there's worse ways to go out

01:45:26.166 --> 01:45:28.000
than by trying to save Santa Claus.

[raspy] Oh, I'll go,

for far too long.

I can't do that.
