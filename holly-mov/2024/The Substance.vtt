02:49.792 --> 02:50.958
- Elisabeth!
- Elisabeth!

02:52.833 --> 02:54.042
We love you Elisabeth!

02:54.083 --> 02:55.083
Please!

02:55.167 --> 02:56.167
Over here!

02:56.250 --> 02:57.417
Oh my God, we love you!

03:05.333 --> 03:07.000
...my favorite.

03:07.542 --> 03:10.333
- Wanna get something to eat?
- Yeah, I'll get a pretzel, or something.

03:15.083 --> 03:18.083
- Remember her?
- She was in that movie...

03:24.375 --> 03:26.458
We're gonna have to let her know
we're gonna be late.

03:26.542 --> 03:27.625
Yeah, I'll give her a text.

03:31.625 --> 03:33.167
He owes me 20 bucks.

03:49.458 --> 03:50.917
Get out the way!

03:51.042 --> 03:52.125
<i>Vamos </i>!

03:54.875 --> 03:56.125
Shit!

04:26.250 --> 04:27.250
You got it!

04:27.833 --> 04:29.375
Feel that power, ladies!

04:32.208 --> 04:33.875
And march! Get those knees up.

04:34.042 --> 04:35.042
You got it!

04:38.083 --> 04:39.083
Come on!

04:39.625 --> 04:40.708
Front.

04:40.875 --> 04:42.042
Kick!

04:42.750 --> 04:43.792
Kick!

04:44.375 --> 04:45.875
Oh yeah, you got it!

04:46.833 --> 04:47.875
Square.

04:48.333 --> 04:49.750
Think about those bikini bods.

04:49.917 --> 04:52.708
You wanna look
like a giant jellyfish on the beach?

04:53.500 --> 04:54.500
Come on.

04:55.250 --> 04:56.250
Cross.

04:56.917 --> 04:58.042
Push.

04:58.750 --> 05:00.958
Kick!
Come on, you got it!

05:01.500 --> 05:03.375
Hang in there, ladies, you've got it.

05:05.917 --> 05:07.542
You've got it!

05:12.000 --> 05:13.500
Great workout, ladies.

05:14.958 --> 05:17.708
Alright, I hope I see you next week
for<i> Sparkle Your Life</i>.

05:17.875 --> 05:19.417
We're gonna work on
the lateral abs,

05:19.583 --> 05:21.875
you know,
the most difficult part to sculpt.

05:22.042 --> 05:23.458
But in the meantime,

05:23.625 --> 05:25.208
take care of yourself.

05:30.167 --> 05:31.417
Move it back, position one.

05:31.458 --> 05:32.833
Great job, ladies.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.500
You got it.

05:34.542 --> 05:36.083
Alright take these down for me.

05:54.875 --> 05:56.708
- Happy birthday!
- Oh, thank you.

06:00.083 --> 06:01.917
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, thank you.

06:02.042 --> 06:04.417
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

06:24.708 --> 06:28.792
I don't care if we have to see every
fucking young girl in this fucking town

06:28.875 --> 06:30.417
in the next few weeks.

06:30.917 --> 06:33.583
Look, I'll make it simple.

06:33.750 --> 06:35.417
We need her young.

06:35.583 --> 06:37.667
We need her hot.

06:37.833 --> 06:39.500
We need her now.

06:40.458 --> 06:43.375
How the old bitch has been able
to stick around for this long,

06:43.417 --> 06:45.625
that's the fucking mystery to me.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.625
Oh, Oscar winner my ass.

06:49.708 --> 06:51.292
When was that? Back in the 30s,

06:51.333 --> 06:53.667
what, for<i> King Kong </i>?

06:56.167 --> 06:57.417
- <i> ...promised her...</i>
- No.

06:57.875 --> 07:01.375
I don't give a fuck
what we promised her!

07:01.917 --> 07:05.083
This is network TV,
not a fucking charity.

07:06.292 --> 07:08.375
Find me somebody new!

07:09.000 --> 07:10.083
Now!

07:11.417 --> 07:16.958
Hey, did you know that a woman's fertility
starts to decrease about the age of 25?

07:17.125 --> 07:18.917
How old is Jennifer?

07:19.500 --> 07:20.875
You better get busy!

07:57.792 --> 08:00.542
<i>It's like when you see</i>
<i>someone fart on screen.</i>

08:05.625 --> 08:06.833
People just love that.

08:07.667 --> 08:09.250
I mean, that's just the way it is.

08:11.167 --> 08:12.333
<i>C'est la vie.</i>

08:12.500 --> 08:14.125
People are just people.

08:14.292 --> 08:17.708
And I have to give people
what they want.

08:17.833 --> 08:19.917
That's what keeps the shareholders happy.

08:20.083 --> 08:23.750
And people always ask
for something new.

08:24.542 --> 08:25.792
Renewal

08:26.542 --> 08:27.833
is inevitable.

08:28.833 --> 08:30.167
And at 50...

08:30.708 --> 08:31.750
well...

08:33.250 --> 08:34.333
it stops.

08:35.167 --> 08:36.625
What stops?

08:37.250 --> 08:38.292
What?

08:38.750 --> 08:40.333
What stops?

08:43.333 --> 08:44.792
you know, the...

08:52.833 --> 08:54.167
Oh, George!

08:56.083 --> 08:57.167
I'm sorry, I gotta run.

08:57.375 --> 08:58.417
Harvey!

08:58.833 --> 09:01.625
George, those ratings are insane!

09:02.792 --> 09:04.333
You're a genius!

09:04.375 --> 09:06.333
Oh what a man, you're a genius!

09:08.042 --> 09:09.583
Let's buy you a drink, come on.

09:35.458 --> 09:37.750
WITH TOOTH BRIGHT
YOU GOT IT!

09:59.667 --> 10:01.625
Well, it's your lucky day, Miss Sparkle

10:01.708 --> 10:03.708
'cause we have X-rayed
you from head to toe,

10:03.750 --> 10:05.833
and you don't have so much
as a cracked molar.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.750
So, you are good to go.

10:09.917 --> 10:11.750
Vaccination, okay.

10:11.917 --> 10:14.125
Not currently on any medication.

10:14.958 --> 10:16.750
By the way, I just want to say, my...

10:16.833 --> 10:19.042
my wife is a huge fan.

10:22.625 --> 10:24.250
Blood type...

10:24.292 --> 10:26.125
Oh hey, it's your birthday!

10:26.375 --> 10:27.333
Happy bir--

10:37.125 --> 10:40.583
Oh, uh, that's an emergency,
I'm sorry, I have to...

10:40.833 --> 10:42.167
Have a good...

10:42.917 --> 10:44.000
Bye.

10:51.375 --> 10:52.583
One moment.

10:53.708 --> 10:55.750
There's just
one last exam to perform.

10:55.917 --> 10:57.667
I thought he said
I was good to go.

11:19.458 --> 11:21.833
- Is there a problem?
- No, it's perfect.

11:22.542 --> 11:23.833
You're a good candidate.

11:24.458 --> 11:26.625
I mean, you're good to go.

11:30.500 --> 11:31.958
I wish you the best.

12:09.625 --> 12:10.667
Lizzie?

12:12.292 --> 12:13.750
Lizzie Sparkle?

12:14.125 --> 12:15.917
Oh my God, I can't believe it.

12:18.125 --> 12:19.167
Fred!

12:20.292 --> 12:22.750
Fred, from 10th grade homeroom!

12:25.667 --> 12:27.833
Fred, of course!

12:27.875 --> 12:29.750
You haven't changed a bit.

12:30.292 --> 12:33.708
You're still the most beautiful girl
in the whole wide world.

12:34.417 --> 12:36.875
You know, I followed your career.
What a success! I mean...

12:37.333 --> 12:39.583
Wow, wow, wow!

12:40.083 --> 12:41.083
Wow.

12:41.125 --> 12:42.208
Hey...

12:42.250 --> 12:44.750
Why don't we go out
maybe for a drink some time?

12:44.792 --> 12:47.083
Now that we're,
you know, "reconnected".

12:48.625 --> 12:49.875
- Oh, of course,
- I'm...

12:50.042 --> 12:51.875
- I'm stupid, you're super busy.
- But you know what?

12:51.917 --> 12:54.333
Why don't you give me your card?

12:54.417 --> 12:56.083
I mean, you never know.

12:56.875 --> 12:58.042
Here...

12:58.417 --> 12:59.708
This will do.

13:00.250 --> 13:02.833
Don't look at my cholesterol levels,
they're a disaster.

13:06.083 --> 13:07.583
- Oh, God!
- Oh, that's...

13:11.000 --> 13:12.083
There.

13:13.958 --> 13:14.958
Now, you've got it!

13:18.750 --> 13:19.833
Call me.

14:08.083 --> 14:11.167
<i>Have you ever dreamt</i>
<i>of a better version of yourself?</i>

14:14.958 --> 14:16.083
<i>Younger.</i>

14:16.750 --> 14:18.042
<i>More beautiful.</i>

14:18.292 --> 14:19.833
<i>More perfect.</i>

14:20.583 --> 14:24.292
<i>One single injection</i>
<i>unlocks your DNA.</i>

14:24.458 --> 14:27.292
<i>Starting a new cellular division.</i>

14:27.458 --> 14:30.167
<i>That will release</i>
<i>another version of yourself.</i>

14:30.833 --> 14:32.000
<i>This is...</i>

14:32.958 --> 14:34.250
<i>The Substance.</i>

14:34.917 --> 14:36.417
<i>You are the matrix.</i>

14:37.000 --> 14:38.375
<i>Everything comes from you.</i>

14:39.417 --> 14:41.875
<i>And everything is you.</i>

14:42.083 --> 14:45.583
<i>This is simply</i>
<i>a better version of yourself.</i>

14:45.833 --> 14:47.458
<i>You just have to share.</i>

14:47.708 --> 14:49.500
<i>One week for one.</i>

14:49.667 --> 14:51.417
<i>And one week for the other.</i>

14:51.583 --> 14:54.583
<i>A perfect balance of seven days each.</i>

14:54.750 --> 14:57.125
<i>The one and only thing not to forget.</i>

14:57.333 --> 14:59.875
<i>You are one.</i>

15:00.250 --> 15:02.000
<i>You can't escape from yourself.</i>

15:20.917 --> 15:24.083
<i>You slip through my fingers</i>

15:26.917 --> 15:29.833
<i>And you drop to the ground</i>

15:32.917 --> 15:36.208
<i>You fade away</i>

15:39.250 --> 15:43.083
<i>Fade away</i>

16:57.917 --> 16:58.917
<i>Here, Elisabeth...</i>

16:59.333 --> 17:00.583
<i>Elisabeth, we love you!</i>

17:01.917 --> 17:02.958
<i>We love you...</i>

17:25.917 --> 17:26.958
<i>Yes?</i>

17:27.083 --> 17:28.083
Hello.

17:30.042 --> 17:31.333
I'd like...

17:32.000 --> 17:33.333
to order.

17:35.292 --> 17:36.708
<i>Address?</i>

17:38.250 --> 17:40.750
1057 Beverly Canyon.

17:42.417 --> 17:45.958
<i>Write this down,</i>
<i>35 North Byron Alley.</i>

17:46.458 --> 17:48.583
35 North...

<i>You are the matrix.</i>

23:46.375 --> 23:48.583

23:52.375 --> 23:53.917

34:13.750 --> 34:15.000
Hello.

36:57.708 --> 36:58.792
Thanks.

36:58.833 --> 37:00.125
We'll let you know by next week.

37:00.375 --> 37:03.458
Thank you so much.
I'm just dying to get the part.

37:09.083 --> 37:10.417
Great dancer.

37:11.500 --> 37:15.833
Too bad her boobs aren't in the middle
of her face instead of that nose.

37:17.958 --> 37:19.042
Next!

37:32.792 --> 37:36.500
Looks like everything
sure is in the right place this time.

37:36.917 --> 37:39.750
Please say your name,
age, measurements.

37:53.958 --> 37:54.958
I'm...

37:55.333 --> 37:56.375
Sue.

38:00.625 --> 38:02.167
<i>I'm Sue.</i>

38:03.250 --> 38:05.833
<i>Sue. Sue. Sue...</i>

38:14.750 --> 38:16.500
Where is she?

38:17.000 --> 38:18.417
Where is she?

38:31.583 --> 38:33.250
What a gorgeous

38:33.917 --> 38:35.000
little

38:35.167 --> 38:36.292
angel!

38:46.250 --> 38:47.625
You're hired.

38:48.250 --> 38:49.500
We want a show

38:49.875 --> 38:52.583
that's just like you.

38:52.750 --> 38:53.917
Beautiful and happy.

38:54.333 --> 38:56.208
People want to be happy.

38:57.625 --> 38:59.500
We air in two weeks,
so let's get to work.

38:59.833 --> 39:02.875
I'm gonna let you organize
the rest with my assistant...

39:06.708 --> 39:07.792
Isabella.

39:09.167 --> 39:10.500
Isa, Isa, Isa...

39:10.625 --> 39:11.875
who has time to say that?

39:12.958 --> 39:14.042
We're gonna make you Cindy.

39:14.208 --> 39:15.208
It's shorter.

39:15.333 --> 39:16.667
It's better.

39:17.375 --> 39:20.750
So, I'm gonna let you organize
everything else with Cindy.

39:22.708 --> 39:23.708
Before you go,

39:23.917 --> 39:25.833
I just have to mention a...

39:26.167 --> 39:27.875
small scheduling issue.

39:28.542 --> 39:29.750
I have to be

39:30.667 --> 39:32.417
out of town every other week.

39:33.917 --> 39:35.667
To take care of my mother.

39:37.042 --> 39:38.292
Who's very sick.

39:46.042 --> 39:49.167
I want you for this show.

39:49.208 --> 39:52.458
And we will work around
any mother, brother,

39:52.667 --> 39:54.167
fucking sick puppy

39:54.292 --> 39:56.042
you need to take care of.

40:01.667 --> 40:04.000
Gorgeous, with a pure heart.

40:04.500 --> 40:06.708
People are gonna love that.

40:36.125 --> 40:37.125
Perfect.

41:03.542 --> 41:04.792
So you jump out.

41:05.750 --> 41:06.958
Touch your elbows.

41:07.458 --> 41:08.500
Head

41:08.542 --> 41:09.542
down.

41:09.917 --> 41:11.000
Contract.

41:14.292 --> 41:16.333
And five, six, seven, eight.

41:16.500 --> 41:17.583
Elbows.

44:45.583 --> 44:47.333
There she is!

44:52.292 --> 44:54.417
Where have you been?

44:54.875 --> 44:58.083
We've all been wanting to have
a drink with you for your departure.

44:58.833 --> 45:00.000
Anyway...

45:00.292 --> 45:02.833
we all chipped in,

45:04.542 --> 45:06.208
and we got you just a little something.

45:06.583 --> 45:08.208
To keep you busy.

45:08.792 --> 45:09.833
It's French.

45:09.958 --> 45:12.833
My wife, she swears by it.
Oh, I love my wife.

45:14.875 --> 45:16.000
Oops, I gotta run.

45:16.500 --> 45:20.375
But it's always great to see you.

47:03.917 --> 47:09.833
<i>...$8.99, 99. In less than a minute</i>
<i>we have it here today</i>

47:10.958 --> 47:14.000
<i>...99, 99. I can't believe this price...</i>

47:44.250 --> 47:46.000
<i>...98, with remote.</i>

47:46.333 --> 47:48.833
<i>I cannot believe the incredible price.</i>

47:48.958 --> 47:51.208
<i>For $49.98, shoppers.</i>

47:51.792 --> 47:54.208
<i>Look at the quality of this thing.</i>
<i>This thing is sturdy.</i>

47:54.500 --> 47:55.583
<i>Beautiful.</i>

47:56.000 --> 47:58.042
<i>Listen to your music at home, shoppers.</i>

47:58.125 --> 48:00.458
<i>$49.98, I'll take one myself.</i>

48:00.500 --> 48:01.583
<i>Put it right there,</i>

48:01.667 --> 48:03.500
<i>hold that one for me,</i>
<i>that one's mine.</i>

48:03.542 --> 48:04.792
<i>How can you ever--</i>

49:34.708 --> 49:38.292
<i>God damn it, lady, come on!</i>
<i>I haven't slept in three nights!</i>

49:39.042 --> 49:41.167
<i>Open up! God damn it!</i>

49:41.625 --> 49:42.625
Are you gonna open--

49:46.500 --> 49:47.500
Sorry.

49:48.375 --> 49:49.667
I thought that Ms. Sparkle...

49:49.833 --> 49:52.167
She moved out.
I'm the new tenant.

49:53.542 --> 49:54.542
Sue.

49:56.167 --> 49:57.375
Oler--

49:57.458 --> 49:58.542
Oler--

49:59.333 --> 50:00.333
Oliker.

50:00.375 --> 50:02.625
You wanted to complain
about something...

50:03.667 --> 50:04.708
Oliver?

50:05.583 --> 50:06.708
What?

50:06.875 --> 50:07.958
No.

50:08.708 --> 50:09.875
No, no, no...

50:10.458 --> 50:13.667
I think it's awesome when there's stuff
going on in the building.

50:13.708 --> 50:15.458
You know what I mean?

50:18.292 --> 50:19.750
I'm actually...

50:20.167 --> 50:21.417
quite handy.

50:21.583 --> 50:22.875
If you ever need...

50:24.125 --> 50:26.833
need me to be of aid in any way.

50:27.125 --> 50:29.208
I got a sack of tools, and...

50:30.292 --> 50:32.000
I got a big hammer.

50:34.417 --> 50:35.917
You know what I mean.

50:37.708 --> 50:40.208
Anyways, I live right here.

50:40.375 --> 50:42.042
So you know where to find me.

50:42.208 --> 50:43.458
Anytime.

50:44.083 --> 50:45.375
Day or night.

50:45.792 --> 50:46.833
Later.

52:42.000 --> 52:43.250
Hi everybody.

52:43.417 --> 52:44.792
I'm Sue.

52:44.958 --> 52:46.042
And it's time

52:46.208 --> 52:47.208
to pump it up!

52:47.458 --> 52:49.083
Are you ready?
Let's go.

54:18.542 --> 54:20.833
Thank you so much, everybody.

54:21.292 --> 54:22.333
I'll see you next week.

54:23.792 --> 54:24.875
Oh...

54:26.167 --> 54:27.917
And in the meantime...

54:28.875 --> 54:30.750
take care of yourself.

54:37.000 --> 54:38.083
Where is she?

54:40.250 --> 54:41.250
There she is!

54:42.667 --> 54:44.625
Wonderful, wonderful.

54:45.125 --> 54:47.375
That's what I'm talking about!

56:03.250 --> 56:06.542
I won't be out late,
so just wait for me.

56:12.667 --> 56:14.208
Don't eat too fast.

56:30.958 --> 56:32.333
Let's go!

58:26.833 --> 58:28.000
Are you alright?

58:32.292 --> 58:33.917
Yes, I'll be right back.

59:10.375 --> 59:11.375
Are you alright?

59:57.417 --> 59:58.708
What did you do?

59:58.792 --> 01:00:01.167
You seem
even more beautiful than before.

01:02:35.375 --> 01:02:36.458
<i>Yes?</i>

01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:38.125
Yes, hi.

01:02:38.625 --> 01:02:40.958
This is Elisabeth Sparkle.

01:02:46.625 --> 01:02:48.292
I'm 503.

01:02:49.042 --> 01:02:50.125
<i>Yes.</i>

01:02:51.042 --> 01:02:52.083
Yes, hi.

01:02:53.292 --> 01:02:54.958
There's been a slight

01:02:55.125 --> 01:02:57.000
misuse of the Substance.

01:02:57.750 --> 01:03:02.125
A few extra hours were accidentally

01:03:02.583 --> 01:03:03.667
used.

01:03:03.958 --> 01:03:05.333
Causing um...

01:03:06.833 --> 01:03:08.333
an alteration.

01:03:09.458 --> 01:03:11.917
So I'm just looking for
the procedure to reverse it.

01:03:12.083 --> 01:03:16.000
<i>What has been used on one side</i>
<i>is lost on the other side.</i>

01:03:16.167 --> 01:03:18.042
<i>There's no going back.</i>

01:03:23.708 --> 01:03:24.750
No...

01:03:25.583 --> 01:03:27.542
I don't know what she was thinking.

01:03:27.792 --> 01:03:30.042
And obviously she was drunk.

01:03:30.292 --> 01:03:32.792
<i>Remember,</i>
<i>there is no "she" and "you".</i>

01:03:32.958 --> 01:03:34.292
<i>You are one.</i>

01:03:34.458 --> 01:03:35.625
<i>Respect the balance.</i>

01:03:35.792 --> 01:03:38.292
<i>And you won't have</i>
<i>any more inconveniences.</i>

01:05:16.458 --> 01:05:17.708
Sue!

01:05:18.333 --> 01:05:19.417
Sue?

01:05:20.167 --> 01:05:22.042
I just saw you on TV.

01:05:22.375 --> 01:05:24.125
Holy moly!

01:05:25.417 --> 01:05:27.417
Makes me wanna join your class.

01:05:27.792 --> 01:05:29.792
You don't give private lessons,
do you?

01:05:32.208 --> 01:05:33.250
Hey, um...

01:05:34.458 --> 01:05:37.083
What about a drink
at my place tonight?

01:05:39.208 --> 01:05:41.000
Come on, don't be shy.

01:05:41.250 --> 01:05:43.958
I see you standing behind
the door there, gorgeous.

01:05:47.250 --> 01:05:48.333
Alright.

01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:49.833
Take your time.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.333
But it's a date.

01:05:52.250 --> 01:05:53.667
<i>You know, pump it up</i>

01:05:53.875 --> 01:05:55.833
<i>You've got to pump it up</i>

01:05:56.167 --> 01:05:57.833
<i>You know, pump it up</i>

01:05:58.167 --> 01:06:00.042
<i>You've got to pump it up</i>

01:07:24.167 --> 01:07:25.333
What can I get you?

01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:30.750
Mocha latte.

01:07:39.250 --> 01:07:41.667
It's long, isn't it?

01:07:43.417 --> 01:07:44.708
Excuse me?

01:07:48.458 --> 01:07:50.417
Seven days.

01:08:20.208 --> 01:08:22.458
Did you follow me here?

01:08:23.458 --> 01:08:25.000
I was just curious

01:08:25.375 --> 01:08:27.625
to find out how things
were going for you.

01:08:28.917 --> 01:08:31.625
Each time, you feel a little more...

01:08:32.250 --> 01:08:33.292
lonely.

01:08:34.292 --> 01:08:35.333
Don't you think?

01:08:36.917 --> 01:08:39.000
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:41.917
I'm fine.

01:08:43.083 --> 01:08:44.667
Everything's fine.

01:08:44.875 --> 01:08:46.792
It gets harder each time

01:08:47.542 --> 01:08:49.208
to remember that you

01:08:49.708 --> 01:08:50.958
still deserve

01:08:51.208 --> 01:08:52.667
to exist!

01:08:55.250 --> 01:08:57.333
That this part of yourself

01:08:57.708 --> 01:08:59.958
is still worth something,

01:09:00.083 --> 01:09:01.625
that you

01:09:02.250 --> 01:09:04.458
still matter!

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.083
Has she started yet?

01:09:12.417 --> 01:09:15.125
Eating away at you?

01:09:32.292 --> 01:09:33.333
Fuck!

01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:34.750
Watch out!

01:09:43.333 --> 01:09:44.375
What?

01:09:55.042 --> 01:09:56.083
Hey!

01:09:56.250 --> 01:09:57.250
Move!

01:10:28.083 --> 01:10:31.458
You're still the most beautiful girl
in the whole wide world.

01:10:41.167 --> 01:10:42.292
<i>Hello?</i>

01:10:42.333 --> 01:10:44.042
Hi, Fred.

01:10:44.208 --> 01:10:45.458
It's Lizzie.

01:10:48.625 --> 01:10:49.708
Hello?

01:10:50.208 --> 01:10:52.083
<i>Sorry, I'm in shock.</i>

01:10:53.208 --> 01:10:55.292
<i>Wow, wow, wow!</i>

01:10:55.583 --> 01:10:58.333
<i>I thought I'd never</i>
<i>hear from you again after...</i>

01:10:58.375 --> 01:10:59.875
Oh gosh, no, not at all.

01:11:00.042 --> 01:11:01.500
I've just, I've just...

01:11:01.667 --> 01:11:03.708
I've just been really busy lately.

01:11:04.042 --> 01:11:05.208
So listen,

01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:07.792
I was thinking that...

01:11:09.583 --> 01:11:13.000
maybe we could get together
and grab a drink?

01:11:18.333 --> 01:11:19.625
Are you still there?

01:11:20.167 --> 01:11:22.958
<i>Sorry, I'm in shock again.</i>

01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:28.250
<i>I could book Luigi's at 8?</i>

01:11:28.917 --> 01:11:31.083
Eight at Luigi's it is.

01:11:31.125 --> 01:11:32.667
I...

01:11:32.958 --> 01:11:34.958
I will see you tonight.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.875
- <i> Bye.</i>
- Okay. Bye.

01:16:32.125 --> 01:16:34.750
<i>And we're back!</i>
<i>And welcome back to...</i>

01:16:35.042 --> 01:16:36.917
<i>Bob and Judy, are you ready?</i>

01:16:42.750 --> 01:16:44.167
Hi everybody!

01:16:45.250 --> 01:16:47.667
Okay, here we go everyone,
clear the set, please.

01:16:47.833 --> 01:16:49.500
First positions, thank you.

01:16:49.542 --> 01:16:50.833
Roll cameras.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.125
And in

01:16:52.292 --> 01:16:53.500
Three, two...

01:16:54.208 --> 01:16:55.208
one...

01:16:57.875 --> 01:17:00.208
And squat, squat, squat.

01:17:01.792 --> 01:17:03.208
Circle those hips.

01:17:03.792 --> 01:17:05.000
Circle those hips.

01:17:05.542 --> 01:17:07.917
Contract, contract, contract.

01:17:08.333 --> 01:17:11.042
Contract, contract, contract.

01:17:11.208 --> 01:17:13.000
Head between your legs!

01:17:19.042 --> 01:17:20.167
Cut!

01:17:23.917 --> 01:17:25.167
I'm sorry, I thought I...

01:17:26.542 --> 01:17:28.417
I thought I...

01:17:29.333 --> 01:17:31.000
I just got distracted.

01:17:31.583 --> 01:17:33.208
Not a problem, let's get right back to it.

01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:35.000
Back to one, please.

01:17:37.917 --> 01:17:39.542
Sorry, it's the control room now.

01:17:39.667 --> 01:17:42.000
The director said he saw
something bizarre on the monitor.

01:17:42.167 --> 01:17:43.792
Bring up the replay on camera 2.

01:17:43.958 --> 01:17:45.083
Camera 2!

01:17:56.083 --> 01:17:57.167
Forward.

01:18:03.167 --> 01:18:04.292
Can I have my dressing gown?

01:18:04.625 --> 01:18:07.125
- Sorry, it's in your dressing room.
- Well then, go and get it!

01:18:07.708 --> 01:18:09.208
Let's just take this frame by frame.

01:18:23.708 --> 01:18:24.750
I need five minutes.

01:20:23.833 --> 01:20:25.958
- <i> Yes?</i>
- This balance is not working!

01:20:26.250 --> 01:20:28.375
I barely have any time
to enjoy myself.

01:20:28.458 --> 01:20:31.333
While she wastes seven days,

01:20:31.375 --> 01:20:33.167
stuffing her face in front of the TV!

01:20:33.208 --> 01:20:35.250
<i>Remember,</i>
<i>there is no "she" and "you".</i>

01:20:35.375 --> 01:20:36.417
<i>You are--</i>

01:20:38.250 --> 01:20:40.708
Hello everybody...

01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:47.000
What's happening?
Where is everybody?

01:20:47.125 --> 01:20:48.667
The taping's been cancelled.

01:20:49.708 --> 01:20:50.708
What? Why?

01:20:50.875 --> 01:20:51.875
Sue.

01:20:52.333 --> 01:20:54.583
Harvey wants to see you
in his office immediately.

01:20:55.417 --> 01:20:56.458
Okay.

01:20:56.708 --> 01:20:57.750
I'll go change...

01:20:57.833 --> 01:20:59.375
No, he said "Now".

01:21:16.833 --> 01:21:18.625
I'll get right to the point.

01:21:19.625 --> 01:21:21.750
We can't keep you
on the morning show.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.208
But why? I just started.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.208
Ratings are through the roof.

01:21:29.042 --> 01:21:31.167
We started at 42.

01:21:31.667 --> 01:21:33.000
Now we're up to, like...

01:21:33.917 --> 01:21:35.000
216.

01:21:35.167 --> 01:21:37.458
It's phenomenal!

01:21:38.708 --> 01:21:40.083
People love you!

01:21:40.625 --> 01:21:42.292
They adore you!

01:21:42.417 --> 01:21:44.042
They want more and more

01:21:44.208 --> 01:21:45.500
and more of you.

01:21:45.667 --> 01:21:47.417
That is why we have decided

01:21:48.208 --> 01:21:50.333
that we want you to host

01:21:51.292 --> 01:21:53.292
the New Year's Eve show.

01:21:53.917 --> 01:21:55.292
You mean the...

01:21:55.333 --> 01:21:58.417
The network's biggest show.
50 million viewers.

01:21:58.583 --> 01:21:59.750
Live.

01:21:59.917 --> 01:22:02.083
You can't go higher than that!

01:22:04.333 --> 01:22:05.417
Now, it's gonna be intense.

01:22:05.708 --> 01:22:08.250
We only have a few months
to pull it off, so...

01:22:08.625 --> 01:22:10.542
Are you in?

01:22:21.583 --> 01:22:23.583
If you don't open the door
when opportunity knocks

01:22:23.625 --> 01:22:25.000
you won't get another chance.

01:22:26.625 --> 01:22:28.375
You of all people know this.

01:22:41.167 --> 01:22:43.167
Just one more day,
and then I have a whole week off

01:22:43.250 --> 01:22:44.583
we can switch.

01:23:02.333 --> 01:23:03.792
We're doing the cover of Vogue!

01:23:05.333 --> 01:23:06.583
Just one more day, okay?

01:23:43.083 --> 01:23:45.250
No...

01:24:14.750 --> 01:24:15.750
<i>Yes?</i>

01:24:15.875 --> 01:24:17.833
She didn't respect the balance!

01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:21.125
She's stealing
more and more time from me.

01:24:21.292 --> 01:24:25.042
Completely without consideration
to the consequences.

01:24:25.208 --> 01:24:26.792
She's a selfish bitch!

01:24:26.833 --> 01:24:27.875
<i>Would you like to stop?</i>

01:24:30.917 --> 01:24:32.000
Stop?

01:24:32.125 --> 01:24:33.458
<i>You are the matrix.</i>

01:24:33.792 --> 01:24:37.042
<i>If you are not satisfied,</i>
<i>you can put an end to the experience</i>

01:24:37.208 --> 01:24:40.083
<i>and go back to being just you,</i>
<i>on your own.</i>

01:24:40.250 --> 01:24:41.292
<i>Would you like to stop?</i>

01:24:44.417 --> 01:24:46.875
Will it go back
to the way it was before?

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.208
<i>What has been transferred</i>
<i>won't come back.</i>

01:24:49.375 --> 01:24:51.708
<i>But you can stop</i>
<i>the experience as of now.</i>

01:24:51.875 --> 01:24:53.208
<i>Would you like to stop?</i>

01:24:53.375 --> 01:24:56.125
<i>To go back to being just you,</i>
<i>on your own?</i>

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.083
No.

01:25:02.667 --> 01:25:03.833
No, no, no...

01:25:04.125 --> 01:25:05.500
I can't stop.

01:25:06.667 --> 01:25:07.667
She...

01:25:09.750 --> 01:25:10.750
I...

01:25:16.375 --> 01:25:18.458
The balance
just needs to be respected.

01:25:18.625 --> 01:25:19.958
<i>So respect it.</i>

01:25:22.958 --> 01:25:24.250
Just stop it. Stop it.

01:25:24.583 --> 01:25:26.375
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

01:25:35.375 --> 01:25:37.875
<i>Bob, you are the winner!</i>

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.833
<i>So Bob, congratulations,</i>
<i>you've won $25,000.</i>

01:25:41.208 --> 01:25:44.250
<i>Now you have one final chance</i>
<i>to answer a single question</i>

01:25:44.583 --> 01:25:48.833
<i>in our big question round</i>
<i>and play for $250,000!</i>

01:25:52.333 --> 01:25:54.083
<i>Now, you'll have just 45 seconds...</i>

01:26:53.458 --> 01:26:55.750
Just a little something
to keep you busy.

01:27:08.542 --> 01:27:09.958
Fuck...

01:27:36.458 --> 01:27:38.833
<i>Yes, ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>she is here.</i>

01:27:39.292 --> 01:27:40.500
<i>The superstar</i>

01:27:40.667 --> 01:27:42.833
<i>of the moment, Sue!</i>

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.917
<i>Are you ready? Let's welcome her!</i>

01:27:45.083 --> 01:27:46.250
<i>Sue!</i>

01:27:48.042 --> 01:27:53.000
You popped up out of nowhere
on our screens like a tornado!

01:27:53.167 --> 01:27:54.875
I don't think anybody

01:27:55.042 --> 01:27:56.625
was really prepared for this whirlwind.

01:28:03.958 --> 01:28:07.208
It all started with the morning show.

01:28:07.250 --> 01:28:08.625
And rumor has it,

01:28:08.792 --> 01:28:12.208
that you are up
for Tom Grant's next movie.

01:28:14.125 --> 01:28:15.250
<i>Ah, wait...</i>

01:28:15.458 --> 01:28:16.542
just a moment.

01:28:16.708 --> 01:28:18.875
I'm being told
you are going to host

01:28:19.042 --> 01:28:21.667
the New Year's Eve show,
can you confirm this?

01:28:22.250 --> 01:28:23.250
Yes, that's right.

01:28:23.542 --> 01:28:24.875
Yes, that's right.

01:28:27.583 --> 01:28:30.458
Oh my God! That is huge news!

01:28:33.333 --> 01:28:34.833
<i>Tell us a little bit about yourself.</i>

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.458
Where are you from,
how did you get discovered?

01:28:37.583 --> 01:28:40.875
I want, we want to know everything.

01:28:43.708 --> 01:28:45.083
Well, I mean..

01:28:45.667 --> 01:28:48.000
there's really not very much to tell.

01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:49.833
I'm just a girl

01:28:49.875 --> 01:28:53.583
from a very small town in Indiana.

01:28:53.792 --> 01:28:55.542
I'm sure that you've never heard of it.

01:28:55.792 --> 01:28:57.750
In fact, it's not even a town.

01:28:57.792 --> 01:29:00.875
I'm not sure you could
really even call it a village. It's...

01:29:01.750 --> 01:29:03.625
a farm, perhaps?

01:29:10.375 --> 01:29:12.000
<i>But, ever since I can remember,</i>

01:29:12.167 --> 01:29:13.875
it has always been my dream

01:29:14.042 --> 01:29:15.250
<i>to be on the screen.</i>

01:29:15.833 --> 01:29:17.958
This is my dream.

01:29:18.125 --> 01:29:20.042
As a child I used to put
on shows for my family.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:22.333
Your family.

01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:23.583
How sweet.

01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:27.542
<i>So...</i>

01:29:27.833 --> 01:29:30.083
everyone is aware

01:29:30.250 --> 01:29:31.708
that you replaced

01:29:32.083 --> 01:29:33.417
Elisabeth Sparkle.

01:29:34.583 --> 01:29:37.708
And no doubt about it, you stepped in,

01:29:37.750 --> 01:29:39.375
you turned up the volume,

01:29:39.417 --> 01:29:41.583
and you rocked their world.

01:29:41.875 --> 01:29:43.500
Were you a fan of her show?

01:29:49.958 --> 01:29:51.125
Well...

01:29:52.375 --> 01:29:54.083
Well, I can't...

01:29:54.458 --> 01:29:57.125
I can't really say
that I actually watched

01:29:57.292 --> 01:29:58.292
<i>her show.</i>

01:29:58.917 --> 01:30:02.458
You do know that we're not exactly
from the same generation.

01:30:03.458 --> 01:30:05.000
And you have to admit

01:30:05.167 --> 01:30:06.500
it was a bit old-fashioned.

01:30:09.542 --> 01:30:10.958
Jurassic Fitness, really.

01:30:11.875 --> 01:30:13.333
Jurassic Fitness?

01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:14.667
It needed a change.

01:30:16.958 --> 01:30:18.333
I'll fucking show you.

01:30:19.625 --> 01:30:21.583
You wanna see some Jurassic Fitness?

01:30:24.875 --> 01:30:26.000
<i>You want it?</i>

01:30:26.917 --> 01:30:27.917
Come on,

01:30:28.042 --> 01:30:30.500
come get
your fucking Jurassic Fitness!

01:30:39.292 --> 01:30:41.458
But my mother was a huge fan of hers.

01:30:43.667 --> 01:30:45.500
So every morning,

01:30:46.042 --> 01:30:47.042
rain or shine,

01:30:48.292 --> 01:30:50.250
<i>Sparkle Your Life </i>was on TV.

01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:52.500
So, in a way, I grew up with her.

01:30:52.792 --> 01:30:54.375
Whether I liked it or not.

01:30:55.583 --> 01:30:58.292
I guess that's why you can say
we have some sort of connection.

01:30:58.542 --> 01:31:00.167
"Some sort of connection."

01:31:00.333 --> 01:31:01.542
You wouldn't exist

01:31:01.792 --> 01:31:02.875
without me.

01:31:14.292 --> 01:31:16.167
It is time, ladies and gentlemen,

01:31:16.208 --> 01:31:18.583
for our final question.

01:31:18.750 --> 01:31:20.542
The question that we ask

01:31:20.583 --> 01:31:24.708
each and every one of our guests.

01:31:25.333 --> 01:31:28.667
Would you share one of your little

01:31:28.708 --> 01:31:30.042
beauty secrets with us?

01:31:31.833 --> 01:31:33.542
Just one little trick of yours

01:31:33.708 --> 01:31:37.125
that helps you look so incredibly
stunning, I mean, look at you.

01:31:37.167 --> 01:31:38.875
- I don't know...
- Say it!

01:31:39.875 --> 01:31:41.250
Say it!

01:31:42.292 --> 01:31:43.833
- Let me think.
- Say it.

01:31:43.958 --> 01:31:46.250
Tell them
who your little beauty secret is.

01:31:46.417 --> 01:31:47.333
I guess...

01:31:47.458 --> 01:31:49.625
Why don't we just show them right here?

01:31:49.792 --> 01:31:51.292
Here's your little beauty secret.

01:31:51.417 --> 01:31:53.083
<i>I guess I just try to be myself.</i>

01:31:53.250 --> 01:31:54.250
<i>To be sincere</i>

01:31:54.417 --> 01:31:56.542
<i>and grateful for all that I have.</i>

01:31:57.292 --> 01:31:59.208
<i>And to always remember</i>
<i>to lead with my heart.</i>

01:32:00.042 --> 01:32:02.083
<i>America's sweetheart.</i>

01:32:11.958 --> 01:32:13.583
"I just...

01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:16.042
I try to be myself."

01:32:17.625 --> 01:32:18.792
Stop it!

01:32:19.875 --> 01:32:21.333
Stop it.

01:32:21.542 --> 01:32:23.250
You're taking it from me.

01:32:23.417 --> 01:32:25.583
That's your little secret.

01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:27.292
Stop it!

01:32:27.583 --> 01:32:30.292
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

01:32:41.750 --> 01:32:43.208
You have to...

01:32:43.375 --> 01:32:46.458
...control yourself!

01:33:06.125 --> 01:33:07.958
I can't go back inside her.

01:33:16.083 --> 01:33:17.542
Gross, old,

01:33:17.667 --> 01:33:18.917
fat,

01:33:19.708 --> 01:33:20.750
disgusting!

01:34:41.292 --> 01:34:42.667
Coming to bed?

01:34:43.375 --> 01:34:44.375
Yes.

01:34:45.167 --> 01:34:46.458
I'll be right there.

01:35:51.500 --> 01:35:52.833
- <i> Yes?</i>
- Hi!

01:35:52.875 --> 01:35:54.667
Hi, this is an emergency.

01:35:54.833 --> 01:35:56.750
There's no more stabilizer fluid.

01:35:58.875 --> 01:36:00.042
Hello?

01:36:01.292 --> 01:36:02.875
It's fucking 503.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.042
Yes.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.625
I'm telling you, this is urgent.
There's no more stabilizer fluid.

01:36:07.792 --> 01:36:09.667
<i>It means you've reached the end.</i>

01:36:12.083 --> 01:36:13.250
What do you mean, the end?

01:36:13.542 --> 01:36:14.917
<i>You've drained it all out.</i>

01:36:15.083 --> 01:36:16.125
<i>If you want more,</i>

01:36:16.167 --> 01:36:18.042
<i>you must let the fluid regenerate.</i>

01:36:18.833 --> 01:36:20.208
Tell me how to do it,

01:36:20.250 --> 01:36:22.500
I need to stabilize myself right now.

01:36:22.875 --> 01:36:24.500
<i>You simply have to switch.</i>

01:36:27.208 --> 01:36:28.500
Excuse me?

01:36:28.542 --> 01:36:31.208
<i>The switch reboots</i>
<i>the fluid secretion process</i>

01:36:31.375 --> 01:36:33.833
<i>so you can continue</i>
<i>to enjoy the experience.</i>

01:36:33.875 --> 01:36:35.833
No, no, no.

01:36:36.125 --> 01:36:37.542
I can't switch, I can't.

01:36:38.083 --> 01:36:39.625
Especially not now.

01:36:39.750 --> 01:36:41.542
<i>There is no other option.</i>

01:37:08.167 --> 01:37:09.292
Sue?

01:37:21.542 --> 01:37:22.708
Babe?

01:37:25.792 --> 01:37:26.833
Sue?

01:37:27.375 --> 01:37:28.500
You alright?

01:37:34.375 --> 01:37:35.708
Stressed out about tomorrow?

01:37:56.167 --> 01:37:58.167
Sue? Is something wrong?

01:38:03.167 --> 01:38:05.542
You a little cranky because
of your lady business?

01:38:10.292 --> 01:38:11.333
Sue, open the door.

01:38:12.583 --> 01:38:13.833
Come on, Sue.

01:38:14.417 --> 01:38:16.292
It's not funny,
I need to take a piss.

01:38:17.542 --> 01:38:18.875
Sue, open the door.

01:38:19.792 --> 01:38:21.500
Open the door, Sue. Come on.

01:38:22.917 --> 01:38:24.167
Babe.

01:38:27.083 --> 01:38:28.375
Open the door.

01:38:40.250 --> 01:38:41.333
Sue...

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:50.333
Open the door!

01:38:51.250 --> 01:38:52.542
Get out!

01:38:53.167 --> 01:38:54.500
What the fuck?

01:38:55.458 --> 01:38:57.333
Get the fuck out!

01:38:57.667 --> 01:38:59.792
Who's this? Who the fuck is this?

01:38:59.917 --> 01:39:01.208
And leave me alone!

01:39:10.125 --> 01:39:11.958
What the fuck!

01:40:05.250 --> 01:40:06.292
<i>Yes?</i>

01:40:07.042 --> 01:40:08.083
I...

01:40:09.083 --> 01:40:11.000
It's 503,

01:40:12.125 --> 01:40:13.792
and I want to stop.

01:40:13.958 --> 01:40:17.250
<i>Are you sure?</i>
<i>Once you stop, you can't go back.</i>

01:40:17.417 --> 01:40:19.000
I wanna stop!

01:40:19.167 --> 01:40:21.375
I wanna fucking stop.

01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:23.583
I wanna stop!

01:40:24.125 --> 01:40:25.250
<i>We'll deliver.</i>

01:41:12.250 --> 01:41:13.292
Sue? I--

01:41:13.375 --> 01:41:14.500
Fuck off!

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:36.083
<i>Are you sure?</i>

01:42:38.542 --> 01:42:41.000
<i>Once you stop, you can't go back.</i>

01:42:41.333 --> 01:42:43.958
<i>You will simply remain on your own.</i>

01:42:44.667 --> 01:42:47.000
<i>Just on your own.</i>

01:42:48.750 --> 01:42:50.917
<i>Just on your own.</i>

01:42:50.958 --> 01:42:52.125
<i>On your own...</i>

01:42:52.167 --> 01:42:53.167
Shut the fuck up!

01:42:53.417 --> 01:42:54.792
<i>On your--</i>

01:43:43.292 --> 01:43:44.625
<i>Elisabeth!</i>

01:43:44.667 --> 01:43:45.833
<i>We love you!</i>

01:43:48.250 --> 01:43:49.667
<i>Over here!</i>

01:43:49.708 --> 01:43:51.375
<i>We love you!</i>

01:43:56.125 --> 01:43:57.417
I can't.

01:43:58.792 --> 01:43:59.833
I can't.

01:44:00.375 --> 01:44:02.167
I can't do this.

01:44:05.167 --> 01:44:06.667
I need you.

01:44:07.250 --> 01:44:08.417
Cause...

01:44:08.583 --> 01:44:10.417
I hate myself.

01:44:13.250 --> 01:44:15.042
You gotta...

01:44:15.292 --> 01:44:16.667
you gotta get ready,

01:44:16.833 --> 01:44:18.333
it's our big,
it's our big night.

01:44:20.292 --> 01:44:22.708
Come on, they're gonna
love you so much.

01:44:23.917 --> 01:44:24.958
Come on.

01:44:26.167 --> 01:44:27.167
Come on.

01:44:27.292 --> 01:44:28.458
One, two...

01:44:28.958 --> 01:44:30.208
you're the only lovable part of me,

01:44:30.250 --> 01:44:31.958
you have to come back.

01:44:32.125 --> 01:44:33.208
You have to come back!

01:44:33.542 --> 01:44:34.583
Come back...

01:44:58.292 --> 01:44:59.292
Come on.

01:45:01.083 --> 01:45:02.125
Come on.

01:45:08.667 --> 01:45:09.667
Come on!

01:51:12.375 --> 01:51:14.333
Got an hour and a half
for makeup. Hair...

01:51:14.458 --> 01:51:16.208
And then we gotta get you
to the fitting room, into your dress.

01:51:16.292 --> 01:51:19.042
After that we have one final test
on stage for lighting and sound.

01:51:19.083 --> 01:51:20.542
We have a bit of downtime
before the show starts.

01:51:20.583 --> 01:51:21.792
You got it?

01:51:21.958 --> 01:51:23.000
Okay, let's go.

01:51:23.125 --> 01:51:24.125
Come on.

01:51:30.917 --> 01:51:31.958
The dress.

01:51:32.583 --> 01:51:33.958
Wonderful!

01:51:34.458 --> 01:51:35.500
Perfect!

01:51:43.458 --> 01:51:44.958
And here you go...

01:51:52.708 --> 01:51:53.708
Good.

01:51:54.208 --> 01:51:55.333
Can we get the dance light?

01:52:00.500 --> 01:52:02.333
I'm gonna be right back, sorry.

01:53:28.417 --> 01:53:31.417
Sue. They need to see you on stage
to set the lights.

01:53:33.500 --> 01:53:34.583
Huh?

01:53:55.417 --> 01:53:56.917
<i>Have you ever dreamt</i>

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.375
<i>of a better version of yourself?</i>

01:54:01.458 --> 01:54:02.667
<i>More beautiful,</i>

01:54:03.125 --> 01:54:04.542
<i>more perfect...</i>

01:54:04.708 --> 01:54:05.708
Sue?

01:54:07.542 --> 01:54:09.125
Yes, let me meet you there.

01:54:09.292 --> 01:54:11.167
Okay, so I'll wait for you on stage.

01:54:27.917 --> 01:54:28.958
Sue.

01:54:32.333 --> 01:54:34.750
Let me introduce you
to the shareholders.

01:54:34.833 --> 01:54:38.042
They have been dying to meet you.

01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:42.875
Is everything...

01:54:44.125 --> 01:54:45.458
okay?

01:54:50.167 --> 01:54:51.417
So, smile!

01:54:59.375 --> 01:55:01.542
It's what we want tonight!

01:55:02.500 --> 01:55:06.083
Pretty girls should always smile.

01:55:08.125 --> 01:55:09.167
Girls, come on.

01:55:09.375 --> 01:55:10.750
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

01:55:12.792 --> 01:55:14.042
Come on, we gotta go.

01:55:16.542 --> 01:55:18.625
Tiffany, Cindy, Ashley.

01:55:18.792 --> 01:55:20.042
Go, go, go!

01:55:20.208 --> 01:55:22.500
Feathers! Feathers! Feathers!

01:56:14.333 --> 01:56:15.750
Hey, ready for tonight?

01:57:05.583 --> 01:57:07.375
I need a better version of myself.

01:57:07.542 --> 01:57:10.292
Please give me
a better version of myself, please.

01:57:16.167 --> 01:57:17.667
Please!

01:57:19.375 --> 01:57:21.125
Come on!

01:59:15.333 --> 01:59:19.333
Looks like everything
sure is in the right place this time.

01:59:21.167 --> 01:59:22.333
<i>Please say your name,</i>

01:59:22.500 --> 01:59:24.000
<i>age, measurements.</i>

01:59:27.333 --> 01:59:28.625
I'm...

01:59:34.792 --> 01:59:36.167
I'm...

02:02:20.833 --> 02:02:21.917
Pretty girls

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.625
should always smile.

02:02:59.458 --> 02:03:02.708
At last, we were starting to worry.
Hurry up, you're up in five.

02:03:21.417 --> 02:03:23.708
There she is, so beautiful.

02:03:24.792 --> 02:03:26.125
We love you!

02:03:27.792 --> 02:03:29.333
This is where you belong,

02:03:29.375 --> 02:03:30.917
and you'll always belong here.

02:03:31.083 --> 02:03:32.375
We can't do it without you.

02:03:32.542 --> 02:03:33.958
We could never do it without you.

02:03:34.875 --> 02:03:36.542
You're irreplaceable.

02:04:04.792 --> 02:04:06.875
Girls, come on, let's go.
What are we waiting for?

02:04:07.042 --> 02:04:08.125
Alright, come on, everybody.

02:04:08.208 --> 02:04:09.417
Let's go, let's go.

02:04:13.167 --> 02:04:15.625
You will not be disappointed.

02:04:16.417 --> 02:04:18.333
She's my most beautiful creation.

02:04:18.500 --> 02:04:20.917
I have shaped her for success.

02:06:13.625 --> 02:06:16.000
I'm so happy

02:06:16.083 --> 02:06:18.750
to be with you tonight.

02:06:21.625 --> 02:06:24.792
I've missed you all

02:06:24.917 --> 02:06:27.417
so much!

02:07:27.792 --> 02:07:29.333
The monster!

02:07:37.542 --> 02:07:38.958
Shoot the monster!

02:07:40.417 --> 02:07:41.417
It's a freak!

02:07:41.708 --> 02:07:42.750
No!

02:07:42.875 --> 02:07:45.083
Shoot the monster!

02:07:45.792 --> 02:07:46.875
Don't be scared

02:07:47.042 --> 02:07:48.125
Monster!

02:07:48.208 --> 02:07:49.667
It's still me.

02:07:49.917 --> 02:07:51.125
It's me!

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:53.083
I'm Elisabeth.

02:07:53.125 --> 02:07:54.083
I'm Sue!

02:07:59.833 --> 02:08:00.875
Freak!

02:08:03.167 --> 02:08:05.292
You freak!

02:08:08.167 --> 02:08:09.958
Monster!

02:08:13.250 --> 02:08:14.375
Freak!

02:08:15.958 --> 02:08:17.625
Monster!

02:08:21.042 --> 02:08:22.458
It's me!

02:08:24.375 --> 02:08:25.958
Just me.

02:08:35.250 --> 02:08:36.500
I'm the same.

02:09:31.292 --> 02:09:33.792
<i>Too bad her boobs aren't</i>
<i>in the middle of her face</i>

02:09:33.833 --> 02:09:35.708
<i>instead of that nose.</i>

02:09:38.625 --> 02:09:39.625
<i>Next!</i>

02:09:45.708 --> 02:09:49.000
<i>Pretty girls should always smile.</i>

02:09:54.292 --> 02:09:56.792
<i>At 50 it stops.</i>

02:12:58.000 --> 02:12:59.292
So beautiful!

02:13:00.208 --> 02:13:01.417
We love you!

02:13:04.125 --> 02:13:06.084
You're irreplaceable!
