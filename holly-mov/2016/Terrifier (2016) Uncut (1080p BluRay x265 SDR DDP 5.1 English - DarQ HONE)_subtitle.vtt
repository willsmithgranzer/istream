00:18.025 --> 00:21.236
(slow, ominous music)

00:47.512 --> 00:49.181
- Welcome back to the program.

00:49.222 --> 00:51.224
If you're just tuning
in, I'm sitting here live

00:51.266 --> 00:53.894
with the sole survivor of
the Miles County Massacre,

00:53.935 --> 00:56.063
which occurred exactly one year ago today.

00:57.022 --> 00:58.482
I've worked on this show for many years

00:58.523 --> 01:00.025
and I've never sat across from someone

01:00.067 --> 01:02.069
who has a story to tell quite like yours.

01:03.153 --> 01:04.362
Thank you again for taking the time

01:04.404 --> 01:05.947
to sit down and speak with me.

01:05.989 --> 01:07.449
- [Survivor] It's my pleasure.

01:08.784 --> 01:10.160
- Now when we left off we were talking

01:10.202 --> 01:12.788
about the moment you
woke up from the coma.

01:12.829 --> 01:14.289
Do you remember your initial reaction

01:14.331 --> 01:16.041
when you first saw your face?

01:16.083 --> 01:17.584
- [Survivor] Yes.

01:17.626 --> 01:19.669
- Would you like to share that with us?

01:19.711 --> 01:21.088
(dramatic music)

01:21.129 --> 01:22.214
- I wished I was dead.

01:23.632 --> 01:25.842
- Do you still feel that way?

01:25.884 --> 01:28.345
- People are frightened
by the way that I look,

01:28.386 --> 01:29.471
especially children.

01:30.514 --> 01:33.892
And it's really difficult
for me to deal with that,

01:33.934 --> 01:35.435
so isolation is ideal.

01:38.021 --> 01:39.606
- Now what about your attacker,

01:40.607 --> 01:43.819
a man identified only as Art the Clown?

01:43.860 --> 01:47.405
There's a lot of controversy
surrounding his supposed death.

01:47.447 --> 01:48.782
The authorities issued
a statement claiming

01:48.824 --> 01:51.076
that his body disappeared from
the county coroner's office

01:51.118 --> 01:52.536
the morning after the attack.

01:52.577 --> 01:53.829
- He's dead.

01:53.870 --> 01:55.539
I saw it happen.

01:55.580 --> 01:58.500
(glass shattering)

01:58.542 --> 02:01.670
(dramatic rock music)

03:22.584 --> 03:24.211
- Did you watch it?

03:24.252 --> 03:26.546
Oh my God, I thought she
was going to attack me.

03:26.588 --> 03:28.381
(dramatic music)

03:28.423 --> 03:31.384
(people talking)

03:31.426 --> 03:33.303
My heart was pounding the entire time.

03:34.804 --> 03:36.973
Yeah well, if you think she
looks that bad on television,

03:37.015 --> 03:40.227
imagine what she looks like
sitting two feet away from you.

03:40.268 --> 03:42.896
I thought I was going to gag at one point.

03:42.938 --> 03:44.439
Babe, do me a favor.

03:44.481 --> 03:45.815
If I ever look like that, promise me

03:45.857 --> 03:47.359
you'll put me out of my misery.

03:48.360 --> 03:49.694
You think I'm kidding?

03:49.736 --> 03:50.779
I'll do it myself.

03:52.530 --> 03:54.366
Yeah, Tom said we won't
know until the morning.

03:54.407 --> 03:56.451
But he thinks the ratings
are going to go up big time.

03:56.493 --> 03:58.703
(rustling)

04:02.958 --> 04:04.793
(laughs)
Exactly.

04:04.834 --> 04:07.420
We've finally figured out
the formula for success,

04:07.462 --> 04:10.173
faceless victims and a host in jeopardy.

04:10.215 --> 04:11.007
(slow, ominous music)

04:11.049 --> 04:11.967
Yeah, watch next month, it's going

04:12.008 --> 04:13.927
to be called Monica's House of Horrors.

04:16.012 --> 04:16.805
Shit.

04:16.846 --> 04:17.847
Hey, can I call you back?

04:17.889 --> 04:20.308
I have like 50 people calling me.

04:20.350 --> 04:21.268
Okay.

04:21.309 --> 04:22.727
Alright, love you too.

04:22.769 --> 04:23.561
Bye.

04:25.480 --> 04:26.273
Hello?

04:27.691 --> 04:29.067
Tom?

04:29.109 --> 04:31.820
(rustling)

04:31.861 --> 04:34.990
(slow, ominous music)

04:53.049 --> 04:55.635
(yelling)
(screaming)

04:55.677 --> 04:58.054
(squelching)

05:07.272 --> 05:08.732
(slow, ominous music)

05:08.773 --> 05:11.901
(staggered breathing)

05:13.194 --> 05:15.572
(coughing)

05:15.613 --> 05:17.824
(laughing)

05:22.954 --> 05:26.249
(tense, dramatic music)

05:28.543 --> 05:29.711
(laughing)

05:29.753 --> 05:31.463
- [Dawn] I think I just twisted my ankle.

05:31.504 --> 05:32.255
- Dawn, really?

05:33.214 --> 05:34.591
Thanks a lot, by the way.

05:34.632 --> 05:35.425
- For what?

05:35.467 --> 05:38.303
- Promising you weren't
gonna get shit faced tonight.

05:38.345 --> 05:39.763
- Guys kept buying me drinks.

05:39.804 --> 05:42.640
I can't help it if people
find me interesting.

05:42.682 --> 05:43.475
- Yeah.

05:43.516 --> 05:46.102
Definitely your mind that they were after.

05:46.144 --> 05:47.228
Who are you texting?

05:47.270 --> 05:48.063
- None of your business.

05:48.104 --> 05:50.273
- You gave that asshole
your number, didn't you?

05:50.315 --> 05:52.859
- Oh my god, you're so jealous.

05:52.901 --> 05:53.693
- Of what?

05:53.735 --> 05:55.111
That kid was talking to
like five other girls.

05:55.153 --> 05:56.488
- Oh, stop being such a bitch.

05:56.529 --> 05:57.572
Just get in the car.

05:57.614 --> 05:59.574
- Oh, you are not driving.

05:59.616 --> 06:00.909
- I'm fine.

06:00.950 --> 06:02.118
- Give me the keys.

06:02.160 --> 06:03.620
Give me the keys.

06:03.661 --> 06:05.455
Dawn, I don't feel like dying tonight.

06:05.497 --> 06:06.498
- Really?

06:06.539 --> 06:08.166
Are we really gonna do this right now?

06:08.208 --> 06:10.168
- Give me the keys.

06:10.210 --> 06:12.587
I'm gonna paw at you like a cat.

06:12.629 --> 06:13.421
Give me what I want.

06:13.463 --> 06:15.382
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

06:15.423 --> 06:17.050
You drive.

06:17.092 --> 06:20.512
(chuckling)
- Thank you.

06:20.553 --> 06:24.682
(wind blowing)
(slow, ominous music)

06:26.559 --> 06:27.811
I'm fucking lit.

06:27.852 --> 06:28.645
(laughing)

06:28.686 --> 06:31.773
But if I get something to
eat, I can drive us, okay?

06:31.815 --> 06:33.983
There's a place that's
open late, we can sober up.

06:34.025 --> 06:35.402
- [Dawn] Did you say food?

06:35.443 --> 06:36.736
- I said food.

06:36.778 --> 06:38.196
You know the place, it's
right there, come on.

06:38.238 --> 06:39.239
- Okay, okay, okay.

06:39.280 --> 06:41.991
Just like give me one minute.

06:42.033 --> 06:43.159
- Fuck me.

06:43.201 --> 06:45.120
- Like one minute, for real.

06:46.871 --> 06:50.542
(slow, ominous music)

06:50.583 --> 06:51.376
- D.

06:54.504 --> 06:55.296
D.

06:55.338 --> 06:56.172
- What?

06:56.214 --> 06:57.340
- [Tara] Look.

06:59.050 --> 07:00.176
- [Dawn] Holy shit.

07:00.218 --> 07:01.177
- Yeah, that's not funny.

07:01.219 --> 07:02.762
I'm about to scream.

07:02.804 --> 07:04.180
- Hey, handsome.

07:04.222 --> 07:05.014
- Dawn, cut it out.

07:05.056 --> 07:06.349
- My friend wants your number.

07:06.391 --> 07:08.309
- I'm gonna fucking kill you.

07:08.351 --> 07:09.144
- [Dawn] Come buy us dinner.

07:09.185 --> 07:09.978
- Stop.

07:10.019 --> 07:11.312
Just shut the fuck up.

07:11.354 --> 07:12.147
- Or what?

07:12.188 --> 07:13.982
Maybe he'll drive us home.

07:14.023 --> 07:15.692
- I'm sorry, she's drunk.

07:17.485 --> 07:20.613
(slow, ominous music)

07:24.367 --> 07:25.618
Let's go.

07:25.660 --> 07:26.494
Come on.

07:26.536 --> 07:28.079
Let's just go.

07:28.121 --> 07:30.748
(keys jangling)

07:31.791 --> 07:34.335
(upbeat pop rock music)

07:34.377 --> 07:35.170
- Oh yeah?

07:35.211 --> 07:36.129
You get dressed up?

07:37.130 --> 07:38.965
Oh, you're a sick fuck.

07:39.007 --> 07:39.799
Where am I gonna go?

07:39.841 --> 07:41.134
Back to my wife?

07:41.176 --> 07:41.968
Same shit.

07:43.094 --> 07:44.846
Maybe another two hours?

07:44.888 --> 07:46.014
Alright.

07:46.055 --> 07:47.098
Alright, bye.

07:54.522 --> 07:55.815
- Great.

07:55.857 --> 07:57.775
(phone ringing)

07:57.817 --> 07:59.444
- Ugh.

07:59.486 --> 08:03.656
That was the longest
piss I have ever taken.

08:03.698 --> 08:05.450
- Thank you for sharing that.

08:06.284 --> 08:09.454
- This guy wants me to meet
him at his apartment right now.

08:09.496 --> 08:10.288
- What a shocker.

08:10.330 --> 08:11.623
- I told him I would.

08:11.664 --> 08:12.624
- What?

08:12.665 --> 08:13.458
- I'm kidding.

08:14.834 --> 08:17.003
I have a little more
self respect than that.

08:17.045 --> 08:18.630
- If you only had a brain.

08:21.007 --> 08:23.218
I've been wanting to
use that one all night.

08:23.259 --> 08:24.928
- Congratulations.

08:24.969 --> 08:27.639
(chuckling)

08:27.680 --> 08:30.058
(rock music)

08:40.985 --> 08:42.278
- Look it's your boyfriend.

08:43.446 --> 08:45.782
- I told you this a week ago,
we'll go to your mother's.

08:45.823 --> 08:47.450
I don't know, six weeks from now.

08:49.160 --> 08:50.578
I'll be right with you buddy.

08:51.538 --> 08:52.705
You gotta see the shape of this fuckin'

08:52.747 --> 08:53.873
guy that just walked in.

08:55.458 --> 08:58.586
(slow, ominous music)

09:22.193 --> 09:23.236
- [Dawn] Are you okay?

09:25.196 --> 09:28.324
(slow, ominous music)

09:29.367 --> 09:31.661
- I think we should get our food to go.

09:31.703 --> 09:32.495
- Why?

09:33.538 --> 09:36.291
(slow, ominous music)

09:36.332 --> 09:37.125
Him?

09:38.126 --> 09:39.460
- Seriously, I wanna leave.

09:40.920 --> 09:41.921
- Jesus Christ.

09:43.423 --> 09:44.215
- D, stop.

09:44.257 --> 09:45.133
- Uh, excuse me?

09:46.259 --> 09:47.051
Excuse me?

09:47.093 --> 09:48.761
Can I get a picture with you?

09:48.803 --> 09:49.596
- Dawn, come on.

09:49.637 --> 09:50.430
- Shut up.

09:52.724 --> 09:53.516
Hello?

09:54.767 --> 09:56.185
(snapping)

09:56.227 --> 09:57.020
Hello?

09:58.771 --> 09:59.564
Okay.

09:59.606 --> 10:01.983
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

10:03.276 --> 10:06.112
(slow, ominous music)

10:06.154 --> 10:07.488
(popping)
Oh.

10:07.530 --> 10:09.032
Oh.

10:09.073 --> 10:09.866
Sorry.

10:12.368 --> 10:15.622
(phone ringing)

10:15.663 --> 10:18.791
(slow, ominous music)

10:28.051 --> 10:28.843
Thanks.

10:32.096 --> 10:33.640
- What the hell is wrong with you?

10:33.681 --> 10:34.474
- What?

10:34.515 --> 10:35.308
Did you think he was gonna hack me up

10:35.350 --> 10:36.225
into little pieces or something?

10:37.685 --> 10:39.103
- What can I get for you buddy?

10:41.272 --> 10:42.065
Hey?

10:43.024 --> 10:43.900
Hello?

10:45.151 --> 10:46.986
(slow, ominous music)

10:47.028 --> 10:49.781
If you don't order anything,
you're gonna have to leave.

10:51.282 --> 10:53.409
- You already have eight likes.

10:55.662 --> 10:57.205
- Can you hear me in there?

10:59.082 --> 11:01.959
Oh god, it's gonna be a long night.

11:03.795 --> 11:06.923
(slow, ominous music)

11:21.145 --> 11:23.356
(cranking)

11:29.737 --> 11:32.865
(slow, ominous music)

11:35.368 --> 11:36.160
- Aww.

11:39.163 --> 11:42.875
(slow, ominous music)
(Dawn giggling)

11:42.917 --> 11:43.835
- What are you doing?

11:49.799 --> 11:50.591
Thanks.

11:56.597 --> 11:58.433
(Dawn chuckling)

11:58.474 --> 12:01.102
- Okay, not for nothing,
but that's the nicest thing

12:01.144 --> 12:03.229
a guy's done for you all night.

12:03.271 --> 12:04.647
- Seriously?

12:04.689 --> 12:05.565
What the fuck?

12:05.606 --> 12:06.691
- Here you go ladies.

12:08.693 --> 12:09.485
- Yes.

12:09.527 --> 12:10.695
- You two okay?

12:10.737 --> 12:11.863
- Oh, he's harmless.

12:12.822 --> 12:13.614
- You okay?

12:15.074 --> 12:16.659
Don't worry, I'll take care of him.

12:16.701 --> 12:17.535
Enjoy your pizza.

12:19.954 --> 12:23.082
(slow, ominous music)

12:32.967 --> 12:36.053
- What do you keep staring at?

12:36.095 --> 12:37.221
- That bag.

12:37.263 --> 12:38.598
What do you think is in it?

12:41.100 --> 12:42.310
- I don't know, who cares?

12:42.351 --> 12:43.269
Just eat your food.

12:46.731 --> 12:48.775
- You fuckin' freak!

12:48.816 --> 12:49.609
Get over here.

12:49.650 --> 12:51.986
All night with you, you fuck.

12:52.028 --> 12:52.820
Enough.

12:53.988 --> 12:56.491
(tense, dramatic music)

12:56.532 --> 12:58.326
Get outta here.

12:58.367 --> 13:02.371
(tense, dramatic music)

13:02.413 --> 13:05.374
Take your shit, and don't come back.

13:06.375 --> 13:10.129
(tense, dramatic music)

13:10.171 --> 13:11.839
Ramon, grab a mob and some bleach.

13:11.881 --> 13:12.673
- Eh, you okay?

13:12.715 --> 13:13.966
- [Man] Yeah, I'm alright.

13:15.676 --> 13:18.805
(slow, ominous music)

13:28.481 --> 13:30.525
- [Dawn] What do you think
that guy did in there?

13:30.566 --> 13:31.901
- [Tara] Who knows.

13:31.943 --> 13:33.778
- [Dawn] Probably jizzed
all over the place,

13:33.820 --> 13:34.737
fucking pervert.

13:34.779 --> 13:36.656
- [Tara] Stop.

13:36.697 --> 13:37.490
- What?

13:37.532 --> 13:39.617
I'm telling you that guy
totally whacked off in there.

13:39.659 --> 13:41.619
He was obviously turned on by you.

13:41.661 --> 13:43.037
- You're fuckin' sick.

13:43.079 --> 13:43.871
You know that?

13:45.081 --> 13:46.749
(dogs barking)

13:46.791 --> 13:47.917
What?

13:47.959 --> 13:51.337
- Look at your hand.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

13:51.379 --> 13:52.880
- Look, at least he had the courtesy to do

13:52.922 --> 13:54.215
whatever he did in private.

13:54.257 --> 13:57.635
I mean, he could have
whipped it out right there.

13:57.677 --> 13:59.512
- I really don't need the visual.

14:02.348 --> 14:04.183
- [Dawn] Well are you okay to drive?

14:04.225 --> 14:06.769
- Yeah, trust me, that
sobered me right the fuck up.

14:08.020 --> 14:09.438
Oh my god.
- What?

14:09.480 --> 14:10.273
- Your tire.

14:11.232 --> 14:12.191
- Fuck me.

14:13.359 --> 14:15.570
Has it been like this the whole time?

14:15.611 --> 14:17.029
- I think I would have said
something if I'd noticed

14:17.071 --> 14:18.823
that your tire had exploded.

14:18.865 --> 14:21.325
- Why does this shit always happen to me?

14:21.367 --> 14:22.702
- [Tara] Do you have a spare?

14:23.870 --> 14:24.871
- It's on the car.

14:26.038 --> 14:26.831
- Wow.

14:28.708 --> 14:31.085
- I'm starting to feel sick.

14:31.127 --> 14:33.254
- Just, give me your phone.

14:33.296 --> 14:34.255
I'll call my sister.

14:36.007 --> 14:38.593
(slow, ominous music)

14:38.634 --> 14:40.803
- Yo Steve, this is sick.

14:40.845 --> 14:43.472
I better get overtime for this.

14:43.514 --> 14:45.349
No joke, this is disgusting.

14:45.391 --> 14:47.184
You got me cleanin' piss
and shit at one o'clock

14:47.226 --> 14:48.769
in the morning.

14:48.811 --> 14:50.396
Let the guy who handles
food take care of it,

14:50.438 --> 14:51.981
real fuckin' sanitary.

14:53.024 --> 14:55.318
Steve, time and a half, or I'm out.

14:57.945 --> 14:58.738
You hear me?

15:01.032 --> 15:03.409
(rock music)

15:05.453 --> 15:08.080
(phone ringing)

15:09.624 --> 15:10.458
- Hello?

15:10.499 --> 15:11.542
- [Tara] Hi, it's me.

15:12.919 --> 15:13.878
- Tara?

15:13.920 --> 15:15.087
- Yeah, my phone died.

15:15.129 --> 15:16.964
I'm calling from Dawn's.

15:17.006 --> 15:17.757
- Ah.

15:17.798 --> 15:18.591
Your phone died.

15:18.633 --> 15:20.176
Can you ever go out
without using social media

15:20.217 --> 15:22.011
every 30 seconds?

15:22.053 --> 15:23.679
- I think you're the only one in America

15:23.721 --> 15:25.431
who has that sort of restraint.

15:25.473 --> 15:27.141
- Yeah, that's probably right.

15:27.183 --> 15:28.392
- [Tara] Did I wake you?

15:28.434 --> 15:31.646
- No, I am studying for
my midterm tomorrow.

15:31.687 --> 15:32.939
- Oh, shit.

15:32.980 --> 15:37.109
- Why, what is it?

15:37.777 --> 15:39.111
What is it, Tara?

15:39.153 --> 15:41.364
- Dawn and I are sort
of stranded right now.

15:41.405 --> 15:43.115
She has a flat tire and no spare

15:43.157 --> 15:45.660
and I was kind of hoping
you could pick us up?

15:47.161 --> 15:49.664
- I have to be up in five hours, Tara.

15:49.705 --> 15:50.706
- Yeah, I know Vic.

15:50.748 --> 15:52.249
Don't bother, seriously.

15:52.291 --> 15:53.876
I didn't realize you had a test.

15:55.294 --> 15:57.505
(laughing)

15:59.340 --> 16:00.132
- Sorry.

16:01.550 --> 16:03.844
I didn't know you were here.

16:04.804 --> 16:07.181
(rock music)

16:11.852 --> 16:12.979
- You know what?

16:13.020 --> 16:14.772
I gotta stretch my legs
and besides, if I fail,

16:14.814 --> 16:16.399
I can always blame you.

16:16.440 --> 16:18.734
- You are the best sister in the world.

16:21.028 --> 16:21.821
- Yeah.

16:23.948 --> 16:24.740
Where are you?

16:37.086 --> 16:38.087
- What's wrong?

16:39.839 --> 16:40.840
- I'm fine.

16:40.881 --> 16:42.216
Why?

16:42.258 --> 16:45.386
- You keep looking over your shoulder.

16:46.512 --> 16:48.347
- Just thinking.

16:48.389 --> 16:49.181
- About?

16:50.599 --> 16:51.392
- Nothing.

16:52.518 --> 16:53.310
- Tell me.

16:56.397 --> 16:58.357
- What if that guy did this to your car?

16:59.650 --> 17:00.443
- What guy?

17:00.484 --> 17:01.318
The clown?

17:01.360 --> 17:02.361
- [Tara] I'm serious.

17:04.238 --> 17:07.116
- Well, you really think
someone slashed my tires?

17:08.075 --> 17:10.703
- Well, he knows this is your car.

17:10.745 --> 17:12.580
He saw us getting into it earlier.

17:12.621 --> 17:14.123
- That's fucking ridiculous.

17:14.165 --> 17:16.751
I probably just ran over
a nail or something.

17:18.836 --> 17:20.171
- I should have just let you drive.

17:20.212 --> 17:23.215
- Yeah, you should have.

17:23.257 --> 17:26.218
But as usual, you have
to be the good Samaritan

17:26.260 --> 17:27.344
so here we are.

17:27.386 --> 17:28.429
Stuck.

17:28.471 --> 17:30.264
Like a couple of assholes.

17:31.557 --> 17:34.518
(chuckling)

17:34.560 --> 17:37.688
(slow, ominous music)

17:43.736 --> 17:44.528
- Steve!

17:45.905 --> 17:49.033
(slow, ominous music)

18:03.130 --> 18:05.591
(dramatic music)

18:05.633 --> 18:06.425
Oh fuck!

18:07.593 --> 18:10.888
(tense, dramatic music)

18:15.851 --> 18:16.769
Help!

18:16.811 --> 18:21.023
Somebody!
(phone ringing)

18:21.065 --> 18:22.274
(tense, dramatic music)

18:22.316 --> 18:24.610
(screaming)

18:25.528 --> 18:28.823
(tense, dramatic music)

18:33.410 --> 18:35.579
(stabbing)

18:35.621 --> 18:36.413
(gasping)

18:36.455 --> 18:39.250
- Yeah, but what if I'm right,

18:39.291 --> 18:42.044
and he's out there watching us right now?

18:42.086 --> 18:43.337
(gasping)

18:43.379 --> 18:45.548
- Show him your tits.

18:45.589 --> 18:47.591
I don't know, Tara.

18:47.633 --> 18:49.593
Look, that guy was harmless.

18:49.635 --> 18:52.972
He's just some douche bag in a costume

18:53.013 --> 18:55.891
acting like a retard
because it's Halloween.

18:55.933 --> 19:00.271
(stabbing)
(yelling)

19:00.312 --> 19:01.272
- No.

19:01.313 --> 19:02.231
He was different.

19:03.315 --> 19:05.484
(stabbing)
(yelling)

19:05.526 --> 19:06.402
He smiled.

19:06.443 --> 19:09.280
The way he kept staring at
us with those dead eyes.

19:09.321 --> 19:11.949
(stabbing)

19:11.991 --> 19:13.534
What was in that bag?

19:14.577 --> 19:17.163
(tense, dramatic music)

19:17.204 --> 19:18.747
- I don't know, Tara.

19:18.789 --> 19:21.000
The point is, he's gone,

19:21.041 --> 19:22.585
and you're never gonna see him again.

19:22.626 --> 19:26.755
So cut the shit, 'cause you're
starting to freak me out.

19:42.479 --> 19:44.064
- I really have to pee.

19:44.106 --> 19:44.940
- So go.

19:45.941 --> 19:47.401
- Go?

19:47.443 --> 19:48.235
Go where?

19:48.277 --> 19:49.653
- It's the middle of the night.

19:49.695 --> 19:51.989
- I can't just pop a squat
in the middle of the street

19:52.031 --> 19:53.240
and pee like you do.

19:53.282 --> 19:55.409
- Well tough shit, because
it's gonna be a while

19:55.451 --> 19:57.661
before your sister gets here.

19:57.703 --> 19:58.495
- Fuck.

20:00.789 --> 20:03.667
(deeply exhaling)

20:10.591 --> 20:13.177
- Maybe that guy has a
bathroom that you can use.

20:13.219 --> 20:14.428
- Who?

20:14.470 --> 20:16.972
- That creepy guy who just got out of that

20:17.014 --> 20:19.016
even creepier looking building.

20:20.726 --> 20:21.852
Tara.

20:21.894 --> 20:23.187
I was kidding.

20:24.480 --> 20:25.272
- Excuse me?

20:26.565 --> 20:27.358
- Yes?

20:27.399 --> 20:28.192
- I'm sorry to bother you.

20:28.234 --> 20:30.611
Is there a bathroom in there I could use?

20:30.653 --> 20:32.112
- Sorry, I don't own the place.

20:32.154 --> 20:33.614
I'm not supposed to let anyone in here.

20:33.656 --> 20:35.366
- Please, mister, it's an emergency.

20:35.407 --> 20:36.700
I'll be two seconds.

20:36.742 --> 20:39.036
- Honestly, I could get
in a lot of trouble.

20:39.078 --> 20:40.079
- Who's gonna know?

20:40.120 --> 20:43.040
- [Dawn] Just let her use
the bathroom, for god sakes.

20:43.082 --> 20:44.792
She'll make it worth your while.

20:46.585 --> 20:47.836
- A friend of yours?

20:47.878 --> 20:50.214
- Yeah, I'm sorry, she's drunk.

20:51.382 --> 20:54.051
It's been a long night.

20:54.093 --> 20:55.052
- Alright.

20:55.094 --> 20:56.595
Just make it quick, okay?

20:56.637 --> 20:57.429
- Thank you.

20:59.890 --> 21:02.434
- Guy's even weirder
looking than the clown was.

21:08.023 --> 21:08.774
- This way.

21:12.569 --> 21:13.696
Good thing you called me when I did.

21:13.737 --> 21:16.240
I was about to bomb the
hell out of this place.

21:16.282 --> 21:17.116
- Bomb?

21:17.157 --> 21:18.242
- Bug bomb.

21:18.284 --> 21:19.118
Pest control.

21:20.035 --> 21:21.120
- What kind of pest?

21:21.161 --> 21:22.538
- You sure you want me to tell you before

21:22.579 --> 21:23.747
you use the bathroom?

21:23.789 --> 21:24.581
- Why?

21:24.623 --> 21:25.791
Don't tell me it's roaches.

21:25.833 --> 21:26.792
- It's not roaches.

21:26.834 --> 21:27.626
- Oh good.

21:27.668 --> 21:28.502
- [Mike] It's rats.

21:29.878 --> 21:30.671
- Rats?

21:31.797 --> 21:34.091
(toilet flushing)

21:34.133 --> 21:34.925
- All clear.

21:36.093 --> 21:36.885
- Are you sure?

21:36.927 --> 21:38.095
- Rat free.

21:38.137 --> 21:40.806
- What if one crawls out of the toilet?

21:40.848 --> 21:43.350
- I'd make it quick if I were you.

21:43.392 --> 21:44.184
- Good plan.

21:46.687 --> 21:48.814
- Do you need me to wait for you or?

21:48.856 --> 21:50.316
- I'll be alright.

21:50.357 --> 21:52.776
- [Mike] You remember how we came in?

21:52.818 --> 21:53.610
- I remember.

21:55.154 --> 21:56.030
- Okay.

21:56.071 --> 21:58.949
Well, um, you have a nice night then.

21:58.991 --> 22:00.367
- You too.

22:00.409 --> 22:01.201
Thanks again.

22:02.453 --> 22:03.370
- Don't mention it.

22:05.247 --> 22:08.375

No suspects are in custody yet

23:19.113 --> 23:20.364
but police are on the look out

for a tall, thin man
wearing a black and white

clown costume and carrying
a large garbage bag.

25:49.846 --> 25:51.181
Isn't she, Emily?

25:52.099 --> 25:54.518
This is my daughter, Emily.

25:54.560 --> 25:56.937
Say hello to the pretty young lady.

26:03.569 --> 26:06.863
It's been quite a while
since we've had neighbors.

26:06.905 --> 26:09.616
Perhaps we can do our laundry together.

26:09.658 --> 26:11.535
I could use some good company.

26:13.203 --> 26:14.413
- Yes.

26:14.454 --> 26:15.872
That sounds like a good idea.

26:18.834 --> 26:20.627
Will you excuse me a moment?

26:20.669 --> 26:22.462
I have to find the landlord.

26:22.504 --> 26:26.049
The first month's rent is due
and I don't wanna be late.

26:28.677 --> 26:32.055
- Punctuality is the thief of time, dear.

26:34.016 --> 26:37.144
(slow, ominous music)

26:52.909 --> 26:56.455

30:45.225 --> 30:48.436
(heavy breathing)

30:48.478 --> 30:49.312
- Help!

30:49.354 --> 30:50.146
Somebody!

30:51.356 --> 30:52.148
Please!

30:53.108 --> 30:55.902
(heavy breathing)

31:05.495 --> 31:06.288
(slow, tense music)

31:30.520 --> 31:32.022

31:43.450 --> 31:47.579

(dramatic music)

31:57.339 --> 32:00.216
(ragged breathing)

32:09.935 --> 32:12.729
(heavy breathing)

32:15.106 --> 32:17.359
- [Radio Announcer] Happy
Halloween boys and ghouls.

32:17.400 --> 32:20.070
The current temperature
is a crisp 43 degrees.

32:20.111 --> 32:21.780
The winds are starting to pick up as well,

32:21.821 --> 32:23.949
setting the tone for old Samhain.

32:23.990 --> 32:25.909
Now if you're still out and about in

32:25.951 --> 32:28.954
the Miles County Area, I'd
advise you to be extra careful

32:28.995 --> 32:29.788
out there.

32:29.829 --> 32:31.039
Police are still on the look out

32:31.081 --> 32:32.958
for a man involved in a brutal slaying

32:32.999 --> 32:36.044
of two employees at Deer
Hill's Pizzeria this morning.

32:36.086 --> 32:37.879
The suspect was last seen wearing

32:37.921 --> 32:39.673
a black and white clown costume

32:39.714 --> 32:41.466
with matching face paint.

32:41.508 --> 32:43.969
If you're just tuning in, this is not

32:44.010 --> 32:45.053
a Halloween prank.

32:45.095 --> 32:47.430
The local sheriff has advised all persons

32:47.472 --> 32:49.683
in the Miles County Area to stay indoors

32:49.724 --> 32:51.935
and notify authorities if they see anyone

32:51.977 --> 32:54.312
matching the assailant's description.

32:54.354 --> 32:55.146
- Really?

32:56.940 --> 33:00.068

34:05.759 --> 34:06.551

34:07.969 --> 34:09.262
Help me, please.

34:10.722 --> 34:12.015
Help me, please.

34:13.016 --> 34:17.103

Come on!

41:12.226 --> 41:16.355
(heavy breathing)

41:18.065 --> 41:18.858
Get up!

42:04.946 --> 42:05.947
It's alright, mommy.

42:07.365 --> 42:09.575
It's only the wind.

42:09.617 --> 42:11.869
It can't hurt you.

42:11.911 --> 42:13.371
I won't let anything hurt you.

42:45.236 --> 42:47.363

42:49.949 --> 42:51.784
I guess the new neighbors weren't such

42:51.826 --> 42:53.703
a good idea after all.

42:58.374 --> 43:02.503

47:08.207 --> 47:08.999

47:09.041 --> 47:10.543
- Jesus Christ.

47:10.584 --> 47:12.294
- Can you help me, please?

47:12.336 --> 47:14.255
- Who are you? How the
hell did you get in here?

47:14.296 --> 47:16.090
- You have to come with me now.

47:16.131 --> 47:18.008
There's a dead woman in your basement.

47:18.050 --> 47:18.843
- What?

47:18.884 --> 47:19.677
- Yes.

47:19.718 --> 47:20.511
Dead.

47:20.553 --> 47:21.345
Dead, all dead.

47:21.387 --> 47:24.640
He's killing them one by
one by one, like cows.

47:24.682 --> 47:26.350
- Look, lady.

47:26.392 --> 47:27.184
Lady.

47:27.226 --> 47:29.353
If you don't go away right
now, I'm gonna call the cops.

47:29.395 --> 47:30.729
- Yes, that's what I've been saying.

47:30.771 --> 47:32.648
You need to call the
police right away because

47:32.690 --> 47:34.233
he's right downstairs
and he's probably going

47:34.275 --> 47:36.068
to kill you, too, if
you don't get somebody

47:36.110 --> 47:36.986
down here right away.

47:37.027 --> 47:38.237
- What the fuck are you talking about?

47:38.279 --> 47:39.446
- The clown with the
white face and the little

47:39.488 --> 47:40.281
black hat.

47:40.322 --> 47:42.616
He thinks what he's doing is
funny because he's laughing.

47:42.658 --> 47:45.411
But I know it's not funny
because they're all dead.

47:45.452 --> 47:46.954
- Get the hell away from me.

47:46.996 --> 47:48.122
- I'm telling you.

47:48.163 --> 47:51.292
He knows I know, and he's
gonna try and kill me

47:51.333 --> 47:52.793
before he kills you.

47:52.835 --> 47:54.253
- Don't touch me.

47:54.295 --> 47:55.045
Don't!

47:55.087 --> 47:56.422
- Help me, please, help me.

47:56.463 --> 47:58.007
- I said, get the hell away from me!

47:58.549 --> 48:01.510
(slow, tense music)

48:06.599 --> 48:08.058
Emily.

48:08.100 --> 48:08.893
Emily.

48:10.728 --> 48:13.689
(slow, tense music)

48:15.524 --> 48:17.067
- [Victoria] Hello?

48:18.527 --> 48:19.486
Is anybody in here?

48:20.613 --> 48:23.324
- What The fuck is going on here?

48:44.303 --> 48:46.805
Yeah, this better be good, man.

48:46.847 --> 48:47.640
What happened?

48:47.681 --> 48:48.515
You burn the place down?

48:50.142 --> 48:50.935
Hello?

48:52.603 --> 48:53.395
Mike?

48:55.314 --> 48:56.690

48:58.525 --> 49:01.946
Yo!

49:01.987 --> 49:04.198

49:12.414 --> 49:13.207
Hello?

49:14.959 --> 49:18.087
(slow, ominous music)

49:25.636 --> 49:26.428

49:29.098 --> 49:29.890
Emily?

49:34.228 --> 49:35.020
Emily?

49:38.357 --> 49:39.191
Okay.

49:40.234 --> 49:41.652
You're scaring mommy now.

49:44.363 --> 49:47.491
(slow, ominous music)

49:59.378 --> 50:01.505
(staggered breathing)

50:01.547 --> 50:02.339

50:05.718 --> 50:06.677
Anyone here?

50:17.521 --> 50:18.480
Come on, you guys.

50:20.733 --> 50:22.067
- Emily, mommy's here.

50:22.943 --> 50:23.736
Where are you?

50:26.071 --> 50:26.864
Emily?

50:28.490 --> 50:29.283
Honey?

50:30.826 --> 50:33.954

(staggered breathing)

50:56.518 --> 50:59.229
(dramatic music)

51:02.983 --> 51:04.026
- Give her to me.

51:08.739 --> 51:09.531
Please.

51:11.450 --> 51:13.368
Don't hurt my little girl.

51:13.410 --> 51:16.121
(dramatic music)

51:22.461 --> 51:23.712
You're frightening her.

51:24.963 --> 51:25.964
Can't you see that?

51:27.007 --> 51:27.800
Emily?

51:28.759 --> 51:29.968
It's okay.

51:30.010 --> 51:30.803
Mommy's here.

51:32.679 --> 51:35.808
(slow, ominous music)

51:49.446 --> 51:50.906
Is there kindness in you?

51:54.326 --> 51:56.578
Somewhere in your heart?

52:02.042 --> 52:05.754
Have you ever felt a mother's touch?

52:13.011 --> 52:14.888
Can you show no mercy?

52:18.642 --> 52:21.728
She's all I have in this world.

I don't know, she's
bleeding all over the place.

01:10:46.832 --> 01:10:50.044
If this guy wakes up,
we are not safe here.

01:10:50.086 --> 01:10:53.422
This guy is armed and he's
a total fucking maniac.

01:10:54.548 --> 01:10:56.217
- [Operator] Okay, sir,
what I want you to do now

01:10:56.259 --> 01:10:58.552
is just remain calm and
stay on the line with me

01:10:58.594 --> 01:10:59.804

01:14:56.540 --> 01:14:59.835
(police sirens wailing)

01:15:13.307 --> 01:15:16.018
(tires skidding)

01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:20.231
(crashing)

01:15:23.984 --> 01:15:26.445
(jazzy music)

01:15:36.997 --> 01:15:39.625
(door slamming)

01:15:40.584 --> 01:15:43.045
(jazzy music)

01:15:45.673 --> 01:15:46.465
(police sirens wailing)

01:15:56.809 --> 01:15:58.519
(crashing)

01:15:58.561 --> 01:15:59.687
(tires screeching)

01:16:03.524 --> 01:16:05.651
(chewing)

01:16:06.652 --> 01:16:08.946
- Police, don't fuckin' move!

01:16:08.988 --> 01:16:10.239
Put your hands up right now!

01:16:10.281 --> 01:16:11.073
- Central.

01:16:11.115 --> 01:16:11.907
10-13, male perp.

01:16:11.949 --> 01:16:12.741
Possibly armed.

01:16:12.783 --> 01:16:13.576
- Let me see your hands!

01:16:13.617 --> 01:16:14.410
- Send more units.

01:16:14.451 --> 01:16:15.536
- I said show me your hands!

01:16:15.578 --> 01:16:16.495
- Put 'em up!

01:16:16.537 --> 01:16:18.163
- I said put your fuckin' hands up!

01:16:20.207 --> 01:16:22.334
(police sirens wailing)

01:16:22.376 --> 01:16:24.336
- [Police Officer On The Left]
That's it, nice and easy.

01:16:24.378 --> 01:16:26.213
No sudden moves.

01:16:26.255 --> 01:16:27.298
- Your right hand.

01:16:27.339 --> 01:16:28.257
Show me the right hand.

01:16:28.299 --> 01:16:29.091
Last warning.

01:16:29.133 --> 01:16:30.259
- You're gonna get shot!

01:16:33.095 --> 01:16:36.473
(tense, dramatic music)

01:16:39.518 --> 01:16:40.311
- Do it!

01:16:43.814 --> 01:16:45.065
No, no, no!

01:16:45.107 --> 01:16:47.234
(gunshot)

01:16:48.777 --> 01:16:52.072
(tense, dramatic music)

01:16:54.575 --> 01:16:57.995
Central, we got shots fired.

01:16:58.037 --> 01:16:59.246
Multiple causalities.

01:17:00.581 --> 01:17:03.917
We needed buses and immediate assistance.

01:17:03.959 --> 01:17:07.171
(police radio chatter)

01:17:08.714 --> 01:17:10.007
- [Police Officer On The Left] Oh my god.

01:17:10.049 --> 01:17:10.841
- What?

01:17:11.925 --> 01:17:14.803
(Victoria gasping)

01:17:14.845 --> 01:17:16.472
- She's still alive.

01:17:17.431 --> 01:17:21.560
(police radio chatter)
(sirens wailing)

01:17:40.996 --> 01:17:41.914
- Aw, come on, guys.

01:17:41.955 --> 01:17:43.165
You're killin' me.

01:17:43.207 --> 01:17:45.542
The revolving doors won't
be installed until Monday.

01:17:46.460 --> 01:17:47.795
- Good to see you, too, doc.

01:17:50.422 --> 01:17:51.840
- [Coroner] Okay, what
are you bringing me?

01:17:51.882 --> 01:17:53.842
- Murder, suicide.

01:17:53.884 --> 01:17:55.094
- Wonderful.

01:17:55.135 --> 01:17:56.887
What's behind showcase number one?

01:17:56.929 --> 01:17:58.389
- Severe head trauma.

01:17:58.430 --> 01:17:59.640
You're probably gonna have to identify

01:17:59.682 --> 01:18:01.809
this poor bastard by his teeth,

01:18:01.850 --> 01:18:04.061
if you can dig them out
of the back of his skull.

01:18:04.103 --> 01:18:06.438
- So I should put on a seventh
pot of coffee, then, huh?

01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:07.898
- You're gonna need
something a lot stronger

01:18:07.940 --> 01:18:08.899
than coffee.

01:18:08.941 --> 01:18:11.568
Landon said they just
found two more bodies.

01:18:11.610 --> 01:18:14.029
- Jesus, they get the sick
fuck that's doing this?

01:18:14.071 --> 01:18:15.239
- Showcase number two.

01:18:17.783 --> 01:18:18.992
- No shit.

01:18:19.034 --> 01:18:20.744
- Police found him eating
the face off of some

01:18:20.786 --> 01:18:23.747
young girl after he ran
her over with a truck.

01:18:23.789 --> 01:18:28.127
He blew his brains out before
they could take him in, so.

01:18:28.168 --> 01:18:29.837
- Halloween never disappoints, does it?

01:18:29.878 --> 01:18:31.964
- And it looks like it's
just getting started.

01:18:32.005 --> 01:18:33.215
- Well, seeing as how I'm gonna be here

01:18:33.257 --> 01:18:35.426
for another 24 hours, thanks to you,

01:18:36.343 --> 01:18:38.095
you guys think you could
get me a breakfast sandwich

01:18:38.137 --> 01:18:40.180
with bacon, or something with bacon?

01:18:40.222 --> 01:18:41.223
- Bacon, really?

01:18:42.224 --> 01:18:43.934
I thought you were
watching your cholesterol.

01:18:43.976 --> 01:18:45.227
- I am watchin' it.

01:18:45.269 --> 01:18:46.562
Watchin' it go up.

01:18:46.603 --> 01:18:47.980
Who's the MD around here?

01:18:48.021 --> 01:18:49.690
- How can you eat a greasy croissant while

01:18:49.732 --> 01:18:51.608
you're cutting up dead bodies?

01:18:51.650 --> 01:18:52.609
- Sweetheart.

01:18:52.651 --> 01:18:54.653
I've been doin" this 22 years.

01:18:54.695 --> 01:18:55.946
Alright, once you've
seen an eight month old

01:18:55.988 --> 01:18:56.989
microwaved to death,

01:18:58.907 --> 01:19:00.492
everything else is just old hat.

01:19:02.870 --> 01:19:04.496
- Look, you had to ask, alright?

01:19:04.538 --> 01:19:06.165
I'll hook you up, doc.

01:19:06.206 --> 01:19:07.040
- That's my guy.

01:19:08.792 --> 01:19:10.419
Stay safe out there.

01:19:12.045 --> 01:19:15.340
(tense, dramatic music)

01:19:21.472 --> 01:19:22.264
Jesus.

01:19:23.557 --> 01:19:26.852
(tense, dramatic music)

01:19:32.775 --> 01:19:36.153
Let's have a look at the man of the hour.

01:19:38.614 --> 01:19:41.909
(tense, dramatic music)

01:19:46.955 --> 01:19:48.832
I hope your 15 minutes
of fame was worth it,

01:19:48.874 --> 01:19:50.459
you sick son of a bitch.

01:19:57.674 --> 01:20:01.804
(dramatic music)
(lights flicking)

01:20:05.057 --> 01:20:07.684
(phone ringing)

01:20:09.394 --> 01:20:12.648
- [Woman] You're really
going to like it here.

01:20:12.689 --> 01:20:15.317
(phone ringing)

01:20:16.276 --> 01:20:18.570
(screaming)

01:20:31.667 --> 01:20:34.378
(dramatic music)

01:20:39.341 --> 01:20:40.133
(coroner coughing)

01:20:44.763 --> 01:20:47.224
(coroner screaming)

01:20:47.266 --> 01:20:50.435
(tense, dramatic music)

01:20:57.734 --> 01:20:59.403
- Thanks again for everything, doctor.

01:20:59.444 --> 01:21:00.863
You'll be in our prayers.

01:21:00.904 --> 01:21:03.031
- Please, don't mention it.

01:21:03.073 --> 01:21:04.658
We're all gonna miss this one.

01:21:04.700 --> 01:21:06.201
She's been so cooperative.

01:21:06.243 --> 01:21:07.995
Makes everyone laugh.

01:21:08.036 --> 01:21:08.829
(laughs)

01:21:08.871 --> 01:21:09.705
- Well she certainly hasn't
lost her sense of humor.

01:21:09.746 --> 01:21:11.498
- Yeah, still a wise ass.

01:21:12.416 --> 01:21:13.208
- It's good.

01:21:13.250 --> 01:21:14.626
It's a good thing.

01:21:14.668 --> 01:21:16.378
It's important to stay positive, right?

01:21:16.420 --> 01:21:17.671
- Absolutely.

01:21:17.713 --> 01:21:18.839
Good spirits.

01:21:18.881 --> 01:21:19.715
- She'll be fine.

01:21:21.049 --> 01:21:22.926
- Well, take care of yourself, Victoria.

01:21:22.968 --> 01:21:24.303
I'll see you in a couple of months.

01:21:24.344 --> 01:21:25.220
- [Victoria] Thank you, doctor.

01:21:25.262 --> 01:21:26.054
- You're welcome.

01:21:27.014 --> 01:21:28.098
- So long, doctor.

01:21:28.140 --> 01:21:28.932
- Good bye.

01:21:31.101 --> 01:21:32.811
- What do you say kiddo?

01:21:32.853 --> 01:21:33.645
You ready?

01:21:33.687 --> 01:21:34.479
- [Victoria] Yep.

01:21:36.356 --> 01:21:37.524
- [Doctor] Oh and, uh, good luck with

01:21:37.566 --> 01:21:38.734
your interview tomorrow.

01:21:41.445 --> 01:21:43.822
(slow, tense music)

01:21:43.864 --> 01:21:45.824
(Bike horn honking)

01:21:54.458 --> 01:21:57.336
(tense rock music)

01:23:02.985 --> 01:23:05.862
(tense rock music)

01:23:55.412 --> 01:23:59.291
(tense electronic synth music)
